program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 14.02.2006 soccer ball stitchers face a tough game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer balls are sewn by hand the upcoming world cup has increased the popularity of soccer balls .
it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .

they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .

" they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .

" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup .

" iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america .

on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america . " a force of about 15 police prevented the crowd from getting too close to the embassy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .

at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after brokeback mountain , will gay film drown in the mainstream ? well , like hetero movies .
look at how many romantic movies are out there .
they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .
there is much still to do . rosa von praunheim , 64 , is a director , actor , producer , artist and one of the founding fathers of the gay political movement in germany .
nowadays , he teaches film and directing at the university for film and television in potsdam-babelsberg . oliver samson interviewed rosa von praunheim send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spotlight on the berlinale dw-world 's berlinale dossier berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .
9 , veers away from the sex and sizzle which dominanted last year 's fare , to focus on political themes .
the stars will be out in full force though .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america . " a force of about 15 police prevented the crowd from getting too close to the embassy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.02.2006 gay film beyond " brokeback " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosa von praunheim made one of the first gay political films the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after brokeback mountain , will gay film drown in the mainstream ? well , like hetero movies .
look at how many romantic movies are out there .
they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .
there is much still to do . rosa von praunheim , 64 , is a director , actor , producer , artist and one of the founding fathers of the gay political movement in germany .
nowadays , he teaches film and directing at the university for film and television in potsdam-babelsberg . oliver samson interviewed rosa von praunheim send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spotlight on the berlinale dw-world 's berlinale dossier berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .
9 , veers away from the sex and sizzle which dominanted last year 's fare , to focus on political themes .
the stars will be out in full force though .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .
harry potter and the final installment of the " star wars " series brought 13 million germans to movie theaters across the country in 2005 , providing relief amid some miserable visitor numbers .
against increasing competition from home entertainment systems and pirated dvds , the amount of german moviegoers dropped 18 percent last year .
the highest drop in history meant a loss of 150 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- to movie theaters . " the type of films are surely a reason , " for the drop , said jan oesterlin , from the agency zukunft kino marketing .
" but it 's also because film pirating is doing a lot of damage . " looking for new ways to fill rows last year , her agency began a controversial campaign against pirated films that ran in all german movie theaters .
she said 11 million films were downloaded illegally last year , a " tough loss " for the film branch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are hitting the theater industry hard but pirated dvds are not the only reason movie theaters are suffering .
amid increasing competition from home entertainment systems and the advent of high-definition television , many former moviegoers prefer the comforts of home to a taking a trip . the fact has caused the theater industry to re-position itself in the past few years .
many theaters are finding alternate income streams hosting corporate business meetings , author readings or other events .
last year , a robbie williams concert in berlin was broadcast live in four other theaters in germany .
" theaters are perfect for such things , because they have a certain size and logistical capacity , " said oesterlin . riding the wave of german movies but movies remain the preferred bait to lure in visitors .
german movies in recent years , especially , have proved successes at the box office .
serious films like " the downfall " on hitler 's last days or " goodbye lenin " have also attracted attention internationally and set a future trend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " received worldwide acclaim " what has gained more and more importance in recent years in germany is the search for the past , for the history of its own identity , " said jo groebel , director of the european media institute . maybe , in searching for their past , german movies might help secure the future of the country 's movie theaters . maryam bonakdar -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 un probes german school inequality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are immigrants getting enough of a chance at a good education ?
the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .

that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 solana mediates in cartoon dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful protest by muslims in front of the danish embassy in berlin the eu 's foreign policy chief has begun a tour of the middle east to defuse the row over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america . " a force of about 15 police prevented the crowd from getting too close to the embassy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america . " a force of about 15 police prevented the crowd from getting too close to the embassy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america . " a force of about 15 police prevented the crowd from getting too close to the embassy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .

in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .

" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .

reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?

they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "

they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .

" they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .

leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .

that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .

at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.02.2006 gay film beyond " brokeback " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosa von praunheim made one of the first gay political films the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after brokeback mountain , will gay film drown in the mainstream ? well , like hetero movies .
look at how many romantic movies are out there .
they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .
there is much still to do . rosa von praunheim , 64 , is a director , actor , producer , artist and one of the founding fathers of the gay political movement in germany .
nowadays , he teaches film and directing at the university for film and television in potsdam-babelsberg . oliver samson interviewed rosa von praunheim send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spotlight on the berlinale dw-world 's berlinale dossier berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .
9 , veers away from the sex and sizzle which dominanted last year 's fare , to focus on political themes .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america . " a force of about 15 police prevented the crowd from getting too close to the embassy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .
harry potter and the final installment of the " star wars " series brought 13 million germans to movie theaters across the country in 2005 , providing relief amid some miserable visitor numbers .
against increasing competition from home entertainment systems and pirated dvds , the amount of german moviegoers dropped 18 percent last year .
the highest drop in history meant a loss of 150 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- to movie theaters . " the type of films are surely a reason , " for the drop , said jan oesterlin , from the agency zukunft kino marketing .
" but it 's also because film pirating is doing a lot of damage . " looking for new ways to fill rows last year , her agency began a controversial campaign against pirated films that ran in all german movie theaters .
she said 11 million films were downloaded illegally last year , a " tough loss " for the film branch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are hitting the theater industry hard but pirated dvds are not the only reason movie theaters are suffering .
amid increasing competition from home entertainment systems and the advent of high-definition television , many former moviegoers prefer the comforts of home to a taking a trip . the fact has caused the theater industry to re-position itself in the past few years .
many theaters are finding alternate income streams hosting corporate business meetings , author readings or other events .
last year , a robbie williams concert in berlin was broadcast live in four other theaters in germany .
" theaters are perfect for such things , because they have a certain size and logistical capacity , " said oesterlin . riding the wave of german movies but movies remain the preferred bait to lure in visitors .
german movies in recent years , especially , have proved successes at the box office .
serious films like " the downfall " on hitler 's last days or " goodbye lenin " have also attracted attention internationally and set a future trend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " received worldwide acclaim " what has gained more and more importance in recent years in germany is the search for the past , for the history of its own identity , " said jo groebel , director of the european media institute . maybe , in searching for their past , german movies might help secure the future of the country 's movie theaters . maryam bonakdar -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .

when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 14.02.2006 soccer ball stitchers face a tough game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer balls are sewn by hand the upcoming world cup has increased the popularity of soccer balls .
it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 un probes german school inequality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are immigrants getting enough of a chance at a good education ?
the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .
but he insisted he had not intended to offend iran .
rather , he was trying to make an ironic point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iranians see the latest cartoons as an insult to their national soccer team " i am against soldiers being deployed for the world cup and tried to make my point of view clear that i find the suggestion absurd , " stuttmann said in an interview published in der tagesspiegel on tuesday . " we regret the iranian reactions and can only explain it with a lack of familiarity with the domestic debate , " der tagesspiegel said in a statement , referring to the ongoing discussion in germany about whether the army should be deployed during the world cup to reinforce the police . " i do not see the iranians as suicide bombers , and they are not , " stuttmann said .
" on the contrary , they are sportsmen like other sportsmen .
so that is why we do not need the army . "
demonstrators pelt german embassy in tehran also on tuesday , a group of islamists hurled firecrackers and stones at the german embassy in iran on tuesday over the publication of cartoons . " death to germany , " the crowd of about 50 protestors shouted as they set fire to the israeli and american flags to the refrain of " down with israel , down with america . " a force of about 15 police prevented the crowd from getting too close to the embassy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after brokeback mountain , will gay film drown in the mainstream ? well , like hetero movies .
look at how many romantic movies are out there .
they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .
there is much still to do . rosa von praunheim , 64 , is a director , actor , producer , artist and one of the founding fathers of the gay political movement in germany .
nowadays , he teaches film and directing at the university for film and television in potsdam-babelsberg . oliver samson interviewed rosa von praunheim send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spotlight on the berlinale dw-world 's berlinale dossier berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .

" since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .
harry potter and the final installment of the " star wars " series brought 13 million germans to movie theaters across the country in 2005 , providing relief amid some miserable visitor numbers .
against increasing competition from home entertainment systems and pirated dvds , the amount of german moviegoers dropped 18 percent last year .
the highest drop in history meant a loss of 150 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- to movie theaters . " the type of films are surely a reason , " for the drop , said jan oesterlin , from the agency zukunft kino marketing .
" but it 's also because film pirating is doing a lot of damage . " looking for new ways to fill rows last year , her agency began a controversial campaign against pirated films that ran in all german movie theaters .
she said 11 million films were downloaded illegally last year , a " tough loss " for the film branch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are hitting the theater industry hard but pirated dvds are not the only reason movie theaters are suffering .
amid increasing competition from home entertainment systems and the advent of high-definition television , many former moviegoers prefer the comforts of home to a taking a trip . the fact has caused the theater industry to re-position itself in the past few years .
many theaters are finding alternate income streams hosting corporate business meetings , author readings or other events .
last year , a robbie williams concert in berlin was broadcast live in four other theaters in germany .
" theaters are perfect for such things , because they have a certain size and logistical capacity , " said oesterlin . riding the wave of german movies but movies remain the preferred bait to lure in visitors .
german movies in recent years , especially , have proved successes at the box office .
serious films like " the downfall " on hitler 's last days or " goodbye lenin " have also attracted attention internationally and set a future trend .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .
harry potter and the final installment of the " star wars " series brought 13 million germans to movie theaters across the country in 2005 , providing relief amid some miserable visitor numbers .
against increasing competition from home entertainment systems and pirated dvds , the amount of german moviegoers dropped 18 percent last year .
the highest drop in history meant a loss of 150 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- to movie theaters . " the type of films are surely a reason , " for the drop , said jan oesterlin , from the agency zukunft kino marketing .
" but it 's also because film pirating is doing a lot of damage . " looking for new ways to fill rows last year , her agency began a controversial campaign against pirated films that ran in all german movie theaters .
she said 11 million films were downloaded illegally last year , a " tough loss " for the film branch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are hitting the theater industry hard but pirated dvds are not the only reason movie theaters are suffering .
amid increasing competition from home entertainment systems and the advent of high-definition television , many former moviegoers prefer the comforts of home to a taking a trip . the fact has caused the theater industry to re-position itself in the past few years .
many theaters are finding alternate income streams hosting corporate business meetings , author readings or other events .
last year , a robbie williams concert in berlin was broadcast live in four other theaters in germany .
" theaters are perfect for such things , because they have a certain size and logistical capacity , " said oesterlin . riding the wave of german movies but movies remain the preferred bait to lure in visitors .
german movies in recent years , especially , have proved successes at the box office .
serious films like " the downfall " on hitler 's last days or " goodbye lenin " have also attracted attention internationally and set a future trend .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .
on the second leg of his middle east tour , solana said he had a " profound desire to recuperate relations between the eu and the muslim world . " on monday , solana met with ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , in jeddah .
the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .
solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the delegation now felt the tide was turning in the cartoon furor .
" they want mechanisms to guarantee this is not repeated and we should be able to find it in un conventions on human rights , " she said . in addition to saudi arabia and egypt , solana will also visit jordan , the palestinian territories and israel during his regional tour . german cartoons anger iran meanwhile , the iranian embassy in berlin has protested to a german newspaper for publishing a " disgusting and abhorrent " cartoon portraying iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . the cartoon published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last thursday showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . " in a letter to the newspaper , the embassy said the cartoon " had provoked disgust and abhorrence among sportsmen , the iranian people , sports fans in the entire world , as well as iranians living in germany . " iran is among the qualifiers for the world cup , which kicks off in germany on june 9 . soccer cartoon not intended to offend the cartoonist , klaus stuttmann , said he had received three e-mailed death threats over the drawing .

" i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

meanwhile , new cartoons in a german paper have sparked anger from iran . the european union 's chief diplomat has said europe and the muslim world must maintain strong relations despite the clash over caricatures of the prophet mohammed . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and egypt 's president hosni mubarak on tuesday discussed mechanisms to protect religious symbols and beliefs .

the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .
in a joint press conference , solana said continued dialogue was crucial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes to defuse tensions during his middle east tour " we must not allow the latest events to erode the solid relationship we have built up over so many years , " solana said after meeting with ihsanoglu .
" we need each other , we have to work together , and we have to respect each other . " solana said he and ihsanoglu also agreed on " the importance of mutual tolerance and the inadmissibility of violence . " " offence can not be countered with violence , " solana said .
" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after brokeback mountain , will gay film drown in the mainstream ? well , like hetero movies .
look at how many romantic movies are out there .
they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .
there is much still to do . rosa von praunheim , 64 , is a director , actor , producer , artist and one of the founding fathers of the gay political movement in germany .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.02.2006 gay film beyond " brokeback " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosa von praunheim made one of the first gay political films the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after brokeback mountain , will gay film drown in the mainstream ? well , like hetero movies .
look at how many romantic movies are out there .
they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .

reason enough to check in with rosa von praunheim , the director and prominent gay rights activist . dw-world : in 1971 , you showed the first political film at the berlinale dealing with gay issues .
there was much criticism at the time of " it is not the homosexual who is perverse , but the society in which he lives . " this year , the berlinale celebrates the 20th anniversary of the teddy awards , honoring gay and lesbian film .
reason enough to be satisfied , to be a little proud of what you 've accomplished ? rosa von praunheim : both , yes .
of course we 're very happy that we have gay mayors in berlin , hamburg and other european cities .
but we ca n't forget that gays and lesbians suffer immense pressure in other countries and continents .
in islamic countries , it is still a death sentence to be gay .
in africa and asia , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against , isolated or simply ignored . you yourself have withdrawn from an activist life .
why ? simply because of exhaustion .
i was very involved in aids work for 10 years from the middle of the 1980s .
we started the first activist group in 1983 , when aids was a big story in the press , but before aids help groups .
i made five films , did radio plays , a lot of public relations work and appeared on tv .
at the time there were others that did n't see a need to limit sexual activity in any way .
at the beginning of the 1990s , i started my " outing " campaign , where i outed gays and lesbians in show business and politics . it was the last method of reaching people with influence , power and responsibility and forcing them to tackle problems , and no longer hide themselves .
very many of my friends had died at this point , especially in america , where i worked for a long time .
i just could n't take it any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new approaches needed to inform young people the number of new infections is now once again climbing dramatically .
some of the younger generation does n't seem willing to protect themselves . young people need to be repeatedly told of the dangers .
when you discover sexuality , you have romantic notions .
you do n't immediately think of aids , death and in finite terms .
the responsibility there lies with prominent gays and aids support groups , and each generation needs to confront the issue anew .
it 's still very disorderly nowadays .
there are too few people who do something from the heart , but a great many aids civil servants , sociologists and psychologists that have secure jobs in the aids sector .
i 've pulled myself out of there .
there need to be new people moving in a new direction .
back then we developed programs in the gay subculture that went beyond simply handing out flyers or broadcasting advertising spots .
they need to think of new approaches . making films , for example yes .
there 's a short film at this year 's berlinale about berlin 's political drag queen " ovo , " who was active in aids work and died recently .
such things happen worldwide , but film is only one of many different measures . the gay cowboy movie " brokeback mountain " is the top favorite at this year 's oscars .
how will gay film develop in the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after brokeback mountain , will gay film drown in the mainstream ? well , like hetero movies .
look at how many romantic movies are out there .
they 're about people and relationships , and that will always be interesting .
it is always important and exciting to show people who are suppressed , who are n't lucky enough to enjoy much tolerance from the rest of the society .
to seek this freedom yourself , to do that which you think is right , to develop that self-confidence - that too , is a subject . but is success in the mainstream the end of gay political film ? no .
there world is still too much in disarray for that .
it 's important that this sort of film does n't come only out of hollywood , but out of the east , where the church still has a great influence , or out of africa and asia , where sexual suppression is overall very strong . it 's not about the rights of gays , lesbians , and transsexuals , but also about women .
there is much still to do . rosa von praunheim , 64 , is a director , actor , producer , artist and one of the founding fathers of the gay political movement in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .
harry potter and the final installment of the " star wars " series brought 13 million germans to movie theaters across the country in 2005 , providing relief amid some miserable visitor numbers .
against increasing competition from home entertainment systems and pirated dvds , the amount of german moviegoers dropped 18 percent last year .
the highest drop in history meant a loss of 150 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- to movie theaters . " the type of films are surely a reason , " for the drop , said jan oesterlin , from the agency zukunft kino marketing .
" but it 's also because film pirating is doing a lot of damage . " looking for new ways to fill rows last year , her agency began a controversial campaign against pirated films that ran in all german movie theaters .
she said 11 million films were downloaded illegally last year , a " tough loss " for the film branch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are hitting the theater industry hard but pirated dvds are not the only reason movie theaters are suffering .
amid increasing competition from home entertainment systems and the advent of high-definition television , many former moviegoers prefer the comforts of home to a taking a trip . the fact has caused the theater industry to re-position itself in the past few years .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .
harry potter and the final installment of the " star wars " series brought 13 million germans to movie theaters across the country in 2005 , providing relief amid some miserable visitor numbers .
against increasing competition from home entertainment systems and pirated dvds , the amount of german moviegoers dropped 18 percent last year .
the highest drop in history meant a loss of 150 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- to movie theaters . " the type of films are surely a reason , " for the drop , said jan oesterlin , from the agency zukunft kino marketing .
" but it 's also because film pirating is doing a lot of damage . " looking for new ways to fill rows last year , her agency began a controversial campaign against pirated films that ran in all german movie theaters .
she said 11 million films were downloaded illegally last year , a " tough loss " for the film branch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are hitting the theater industry hard but pirated dvds are not the only reason movie theaters are suffering .
amid increasing competition from home entertainment systems and the advent of high-definition television , many former moviegoers prefer the comforts of home to a taking a trip . the fact has caused the theater industry to re-position itself in the past few years .
many theaters are finding alternate income streams hosting corporate business meetings , author readings or other events .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls .

in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .

leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .

the oic is a pan-islamic body representing 57 nations .

" this is unacceptable . " eu averse to new blasphemy laws ihsanoglu said he also wanted the eu to pass blasphemy laws .
" i have proposed many ideas , legislative measures to be taken by the european union , " he said .
solana , who later met king abdullah in riyadh , made no comment on the idea of eu measures .
but a european official close to the talks told reuters that the eu was careful to avoid promises on legislative prohibitions against offending muslims . " we deviated from the word ' laws ' and moved to concentrate on conventions , resolutions and such things .
we have to be careful of western public opinion , " the official said . though muslims consider any portrayal of mohammed blasphemous , many in europe have supported the freedom of thepress to publish the cartoons .

the country 's movie theaters wish they would receive the same sort of attention in light of sagging visitor numbers . were it not for the work of a teenage magician and luke skywalker , german movie theaters might be boarding up one after the other .
harry potter and the final installment of the " star wars " series brought 13 million germans to movie theaters across the country in 2005 , providing relief amid some miserable visitor numbers .
against increasing competition from home entertainment systems and pirated dvds , the amount of german moviegoers dropped 18 percent last year .
the highest drop in history meant a loss of 150 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- to movie theaters . " the type of films are surely a reason , " for the drop , said jan oesterlin , from the agency zukunft kino marketing .
" but it 's also because film pirating is doing a lot of damage . " looking for new ways to fill rows last year , her agency began a controversial campaign against pirated films that ran in all german movie theaters .
she said 11 million films were downloaded illegally last year , a " tough loss " for the film branch .

many theaters are finding alternate income streams hosting corporate business meetings , author readings or other events .
last year , a robbie williams concert in berlin was broadcast live in four other theaters in germany .
" theaters are perfect for such things , because they have a certain size and logistical capacity , " said oesterlin . riding the wave of german movies but movies remain the preferred bait to lure in visitors .
german movies in recent years , especially , have proved successes at the box office .
serious films like " the downfall " on hitler 's last days or " goodbye lenin " have also attracted attention internationally and set a future trend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " received worldwide acclaim " what has gained more and more importance in recent years in germany is the search for the past , for the history of its own identity , " said jo groebel , director of the european media institute . maybe , in searching for their past , german movies might help secure the future of the country 's movie theaters . maryam bonakdar -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 german government divided over military action against iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has not ruled out a military option against iran while iran seems resolved to stick to its uranium enrichment program despite international protests , lawmakers on both sides of germany 's governing coalition are increasingly divided over how to react . the german government wants a diplomatic solution to the dispute with iran over its nuclear program .
according to spokesman ulrich wilhelm , it is united in this aim . " i do n't see any dissent within the government , " wilhelm said . but lawmakers from the christian union parties and the social democrats which make up the coalition government have publicly expressed contrary opinions on how to react to iran . deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , criticized the debate about a possible military strike . " the most stupid thing we could do now is to fight about how we 're going to react , " erler told german television zdf on tuesday .
he said there was " a very wide consensus " that the international community had to work together on this issue . merkel hopes for a diplomatic solution the iranian government has announced it is backing out of a round of scheduled negotiations later this week with russia over its nuclear program . at the international security conference in munich earlier this month , german chancellor angela merkel urged the international community to step up pressure on the government in tehran to finally give up its unilateral uranium enrichment activities . merkel , a member of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said at the conference that germany was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the current conflict surrounding iran .
but she added that a military option must not be ruled out in the event that everything else failed to bring tehran 's leadership to its senses . criticism from the left several social democratic leaders have responded by criticizing merkel for mentioning the possibility of a military option at all .
they claim that any mention of such measures may pour even more oil into the fire , which already seems to be burning the last remaining bridges between the west and the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is currently visiting the middle east prior to his departure for the middle east , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier put the chancellor 's remarks into perspective . " just like me , angela merkel is interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict , " steinmeier said .
" we 're both willing to help make such a solution possible .
in my view , it does n't make sense to answer questions related to scenarios , which are simply not on the agenda . " germany wants to act as a " peace-loving power " one of merkel 's critics , spd secretary general hubertus heil , applauded steinmeier for clearly backing a peaceful settlement of the iran conflict .
heil said there was no alternative to a diplomatic solution . " steinmeier has made it clear that we do n't want a militarization of thinking in our country , " heil said .
he said this approach was a continuation of the policy developed under former spd chancellor gerhard schröder . " we are prepared to assume responsibility , " heil said .
" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

" but in doing so , we want to appear and act as a peace-loving power with respect for other nations . " but friedbert pflüger -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a state secretary in the defense ministry , said the spd should not attempt to use a foreign policy issue to score points domestically in the run-up to state elections .
the spd had also marketed itself as a " peace-loving " party prior to the us-led invasion of iraq . " rehashing this strategy will fail , " pflüger told the newspaper neue osnabrücker zeitung . military option should remain on the table cdu lawmaker eckhard von klaeden , his party 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticized those who believe that anything could be gained by not talking about a military option at all . " if we say upfront that we categorically rule out any military option , we deliberately weaken our position at the negotiating table , " von klaeden said .
" if we did so , the west 's position would be pretty predicable and hardly be able to really exert pressure on tehran . " von klaeden said his stance had nothing to do with war-mongering .
he also dismissed any attempt to liken the current situation with the one that led to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . some social democrats agree with von klaeden , though .
spd defense expert rainer arnold , a dissident in his party on this issue , said that it made no sense at present to go into detail about all possible moves against tehran . but , arnold said , it would likewise be foolish to say right now what one would never be prepared to do . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 14.02.2006 soccer ball stitchers face a tough game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer balls are sewn by hand the upcoming world cup has increased the popularity of soccer balls .
it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 14.02.2006 opinion : could turkey be a middleman in the cartoon conflict ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey might be the bridge between east and west needed now more than ever turkey occupies a unique position among nations - halfway between east and west .
in the current row over mohammed caricatures , which have outraged the muslim world , turkey could take on an important mediating role . turkey , which once again finds itself between the battle lines , has taken a rational position regarding the caricature row .
leading journalists there have lined up on the side of large european papers to call for reason and to avoid jeopardizing the already difficult dialogue between the western and islamic worlds .
the turkish government wrote to the leaders of several muslim countries calling for moderation , while also calling on the europeans not to exacerbate the situation . while there certainly were protests in turkey against the publication and the later reprinting of the mohammed caricatures by european newspapers , they remained peaceful .
however , in northeastern anatolia , a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a catholic priest out of revenge for the cartoons ' publication .
political observers , on the other hand , expect that during the trial it will come out that the murder was a result of rather ordinary criminal motives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon row reached turkey as well ; police guard the danish embassy turkey stands with one foot planted in the west - politically , culturally and even historically - but the other is anchored in the east .
that unique position means it is able , like no other , to act as a link between the western and islamic worlds .
turkey itself is a good example of how an overwhelmingly muslim country can develop into a democracy modeled after those of europe .
ankara is well represented in europe 's political and economic organizations ; the country is a nato member . at the same time , its population makes it firmly a part of the global islamic community .
that the current secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference is a turk who was voted in unanimously is an indication of the will of islamic countries to accept turkey as an intermediary between the two cultures . realism necessary but as a mediator in the cartoon row , turkey should not be expected to do the impossible .
the best mediation is condemned to failure from the outset if the two quarrelling sides are n't ready to at least look for some small patch of common ground .
how ready the two sides really are to pursue a common goal remains unclear .
in addition , while the protests in many islamic countries are very real , they have also been exploited for political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck was set on fire by protesters outside a us military base in qalat , afghanistan under these circumstances , we can only hope that the west will also differentiate between real and directed protests , and that press freedom - one of the most important and hard-fought-for achievements of the modern world - is not misused as an excuse to spread preconceptions about other cultures . turkey can certainly have a moderating effect on islamic countries to which it has close economic and political ties .
at the same time , ankara will not be able to pull a perfect recipe for a solution to this conflict out of its hat .
one also has to be careful not to link turkey 's success as an intermediary with its eu ambitions .
that would not only be unfair , it would belie the fact that in the current cartoon row , ankara , with its unique ability to work toward a meaningful east-west dialogue , is working very much in concert with europe . baha güngör -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

investment bankers j.p. morgan had reportedly organized bidding process , with france 's tf-1 and america 's nbc among those reportedly interested . but positive results for the year ending 2005 were enough to convince saban that prosieben might be worth holding onto a little longer .
sales climbed 8.4 percent to just under 2 billion euros , and the pre-tax results rose 30 percent to 418.5 million euros thanks to rising tv ad revenues and falling costs .
the company will announce the results next week . the saban-led holding company p7s1 released a statement on monday saying that they would no longer consider bids for the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 14.02.2006 soccer ball stitchers face a tough game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer balls are sewn by hand the upcoming world cup has increased the popularity of soccer balls .
it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.02.2006 un probes german school inequality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are immigrants getting enough of a chance at a good education ?
the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 14.02.2006 soccer ball stitchers face a tough game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer balls are sewn by hand the upcoming world cup has increased the popularity of soccer balls .
it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made . with less than four months to go before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , europeans have been hit with soccer fever .
fans are rushing to buy their favorite team 's jerseys and are already munching on soccer-inspired sweets . of course , many enthusiasts want to kick a ball around themselves and retailers have seen an increased demand for soccer balls .
many consumers , though , are unaware of the conditions surrounding the production of this popular merchandise . around 80 percent of the world 's soccer balls are produced in sialkot in northeastern pakistan - by hand .
it takes about an hour-and-a-half to sew together the 32 honeycomb-shaped pieces of synthetic leather with 650 stitches . the region has developed into a worldwide center for producing sporting goods .
but up to a decade ago , making balls was mainly a cottage industry in peoples ' homes .
human rights organizations then drew extensive attention to the often dire working conditions and the use of child labor .
today , the production facilities in sialkot are monitored . " the problem , though , is that fake balls are produced outside of this zone and one ca n't rule out that children are sewing them , " said adidas corporate pr manager anne putz . fifa only lets fair balls roll adidas has supplied the official match balls used at the world cup since 1970 .
the ball for the 2006 world cup is manufactured in thailand .
however , it is not sewn , but is instead melded together by thermal-bonding technology . the sporting goods giant does have other balls produced by hand in sialkot , though , putz said .
adidas is one party of the so-called " atlanta agreement . "
in 1997 , the sporting goods industry , labor organizations , child welfare groups and other non-governmental organizations agreed to participate in the program to eliminate child labor in pakistan 's soccer ball industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup ball is named " teamgeist " or team spirit international brands pledged to purchase soccer balls in pakistan exclusively from companies in good standing with the program , which is also backed by world soccer body fifa . the atlanta agreement got ball production out of the home and into stitching centers , which can be monitored more easily .
child labor has to a large extent disappeared from this sector . " but the wages generally still do n't suffice to enable children better education opportunities , " said barbara schimmelpfennig , spokeswoman for gepa , europe 's largest fair trade company . helping people help themselves wuppertal-based gepa was one of the first fair trade organizations to set up stitching centers in sialkot - along with its partner there , talon sports - back in 1998 .
these include village-based facilities solely for women . " since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .
an envoy is on a fact-finding mission this week to explore shortcomings in educational equality . when it comes to their educational performance , germany just ca n't seem to cut a good figure on the world stage .
six years after the organization for economic cooperation and development slammed german schools in a worldwide comparative study , the paris-based organization released a study claiming inequality in access to education .
the numbers show that a 15-year-old student whose parents have an academic background is likely to be two years ahead of a working class student in scholastic achievement .
and the chances of going to a university are four times greater . the numbers raised the eyebrows of the united nations human rights commission .
this week , un envoy vernor munoz will investigate the possible inequalities during a 10-day fact finding mission .
upon landing in berlin , he first met with minister for education and families annette schavan , who appeared unconcerned by the un 's interest . no reason for concern " there may be the impression in public that germany 's low achievements in international education studies are the reasons for this visit , " she said following the meeting .
" but that is simply not so .
we have changed much in recent years and the visit comes at a time when a number of thorough reforms are beginning to take hold … there is no reason to be worried about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister schavan is n't worried in 2000 , german society was shocked out of decades of false satisfaction concerning its education system when the oecd 's program for international student assessment - pisa - gave pupils here mediocre marks at best .
they were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . the pisa study also highlighted inequalities in the german school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers . germans kids under too much pressure oecd researcher andreas schleicher said germany 's stringent and sometimes elitist school selection procedures are largely to blame for the discrepancy .
countries like finland and japan , which performed best in the study , do n't force students to decide at age eight or nine where to go to college .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese children : less pressure early on " in all those countries social background has much less of an impact on outcomes than it does have in a country like germany , " said schleicher .
" they are providing students with equitable opportunities . " schleicher went on to praise the two countries ' results-oriented approach . " they have clear objectives , well defined and clear to all stakeholders who are pursuing these objectives systematically , " said schleicher . parents ' groups waiting for results but schavan appeared resolute after the meeting that there was no need for massive reform in germany 's education system .
parents ' groups largely agree , but say they are curious to see what the un envoy digs up . the parents admit that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge and skills can no longer be tolerated and should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

" since women are not allowed to work together with men in pakistan , this gives them an opportunity to have a job and improve their families ' incomes , " said schimmelpfennig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rahila says it 's particularly important to her that her children get a good education gepa adheres to a bonus system , whereby it pays talon a premium between $ 0.40 and $ 1.00 -lrb- 0.34 and 0.84 euros -rrb- per fairly produced soccer ball , depending on the quality .
the talon fair trade workers welfare society - comprised of stitchers and talon representatives - decides where the funds will be allocated . " part of this premium goes into increasing wages and another part into a fund for small loans , " said schimmelpfennig .
" the loans , for example , can help workers set up another leg to stand on , as soccer ball production can be very seasonal work . " the premiums are also used to improve working conditions in the stitching centers and to set up health and education facilities , such as a pre-school for workers ' children .
healthcare for talon 's workers and their families is free . talon employs 1,500 stitchers , including 400 women .
rahila , for example , earns about 74 percent more for a fair ball of the most widespread quality than a conventional one : 47 rupees -lrb- 0.65 euros -rrb- instead of 27 rupees .
with that wage , the 40-year-old mother of eight can make a considerable contribution to her family 's livelihood . the people behind the balls in the run-up to the world cup , gepa has launched its campaign " fair pay - fair play " to make consumers more aware of the conditions behind soccer ball production . " especially now , with the world cup approaching , cheap balls and forgeries are a serious problem , " said schimmelpfennig .
while fair balls can make a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gepa got the ball rolling with fairly produced balls " our concept sees aid as part of the retail process , " said schimmelpfennig .
instead of consumers donating to a project , they instead pay more for a fairly produced ball .
" this gives us the leeway for these measures . " " in europe , people want to buy inexpensive balls and that impacts wages , " said ammar faisal al assad , director of talon sports .
" but because of fair trade , many people have become aware of the people behind the balls . " al assad said he hoped more consumers would choose fairly produced balls , as they currently make up only 5 percent of talon 's annual production of two million balls . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the world cup circus rolls on to germany dw-world 's dossier about the german world cup 's many facets dw-world : germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves .

liverpudlian melissa curry will give the bet , which could win £ 750 after bookmakers backed it at odds of 25/1 , to her boyfriend on tuesday .
the pair both work for the same airline and have been together for 10 months .
ms curry , 27 , said she and matthew dockray , 25 , had already discussed the prospect of marriage .

he said prince william and kate middleton were among the celebrity couples named as being likely to marry first in 2006 .

before the commons vote , two bar workers gave the bbc news website their very different opinions .
opposed to total ban vincent healy , who works in and manages riley 's pub in king 's road , chelsea , west london " i am in favour of having a partial ban with some restrictions .
that would do two things .
it would allow smokers and non-smokers to do what they want in a free society .
it would be very difficult for me to start arguing that there are no health risks , but since these have been raised there has been a move from retailers to create non-smoking establishments .
given time i think the industry , responding to market forces , will give smokers a choice of where to drink and staff a choice about where they want work .
i accept that smoking is harmful but there are many non-smoking pubs right now .
we know from the experience in ireland , where a smoking ban was brought in , that there has been a dramatic fall-off in trade in the first year .
' land-locked ' some of the fall-off has been experienced by the pubs that ca n't afford to make substantial investment in their gardens .
people who have decided they have a business big enough have invested in improvements to their outside spaces for smokers .
they create an outside environment that encourages smokers to come back by making the garden pleasant and providing heating .
people wo n't come out for nine months of the year in the inclement weather of the british isles so you have to make a comfortable environment without contravening the enclosed spaces regulations .
sometimes publicans have to go much further than just making their gardens nice , they might try to create a sort of outside room for smokers by lifting the roof a few inches off the top line of bricks .
the problem for me is that we are completely land-locked and do not have a garden or patio area .
our other concern is that if the exemption for clubs remains we would then be competing with 20,000 venues that would be able to say to people who smoke - come in for a drink . "
in favour of total ban elaine londesborough , who works at the student union bar at the london school of economics in central london " i work in the student union bar twice a week and i 've worked in lots of bars before this as well as restaurants where people smoke .
i do feel the ill-effects of a smoky atmosphere .
i suffer from chronic bronchitis and i think that part of that is due to breathing in smoke a lot of the time .
chronic bronchitis basically means that i have a cough for quite a lot of the time , about three months of the year .
if i get any sort of cold i am left with a cough which lasts for weeks .
i am not immediately worried about it developing into something more serious but if it 's bad enough to cause this condition then i do n't want it to get any worse .
legal challenges ?
also the whole environment i work in is unpleasant - it 's horrid to wake up the next morning smelling of smoke .
i ca n't see any justification for the partial ban .
it 's totally ridiculous that the government can protect some workers and not others and from a human rights point of view you can not justify it .
i think there 's a very strong possibility that people will challenge this in court .
new york has already seen better business because of the smoking ban .
and with the level of public support a full ban has here , i can only see business remaining the same or getting even better .
' level playing field ' what would affect business is if there is are exemptions because there would n't be a level playing field .
the bar where i work started serving paninis and some bar snacks a few months ago but there was a huge debate in the student union at the time .
it is likely the that management will stop serving food if it means that customers will not be able to smoke . "
the lse student union confirmed it would have to review food serving policy in all its premises if a partial ban on smoking comes into force .

given time i think the industry , responding to market forces , will give smokers a choice of where to drink and staff a choice about where they want work .
i accept that smoking is harmful but there are many non-smoking pubs right now .
we know from the experience in ireland , where a smoking ban was brought in , that there has been a dramatic fall-off in trade in the first year .
' land-locked ' some of the fall-off has been experienced by the pubs that ca n't afford to make substantial investment in their gardens .
people who have decided they have a business big enough have invested in improvements to their outside spaces for smokers .
they create an outside environment that encourages smokers to come back by making the garden pleasant and providing heating .
people wo n't come out for nine months of the year in the inclement weather of the british isles so you have to make a comfortable environment without contravening the enclosed spaces regulations .
sometimes publicans have to go much further than just making their gardens nice , they might try to create a sort of outside room for smokers by lifting the roof a few inches off the top line of bricks .
the problem for me is that we are completely land-locked and do not have a garden or patio area .
our other concern is that if the exemption for clubs remains we would then be competing with 20,000 venues that would be able to say to people who smoke - come in for a drink .
in favour of total ban elaine londesborough , who works at the student union bar at the london school of economics in central london elaine believes there could be legal challenges from a partial ban i work in the student union bar twice a week and i 've worked in lots of bars before this as well as restaurants where people smoke .
i do feel the ill-effects of a smoky atmosphere .
i suffer from chronic bronchitis and i think that part of that is due to breathing in smoke a lot of the time .
chronic bronchitis basically means that i have a cough for quite a lot of the time , about three months of the year .
if i get any sort of cold i am left with a cough which lasts for weeks .
i am not immediately worried about it developing into something more serious but if it 's bad enough to cause this condition then i do n't want it to get any worse .
legal challenges ?
also the whole environment i work in is unpleasant - it 's horrid to wake up the next morning smelling of smoke .
i ca n't see any justification for the partial ban .
it 's totally ridiculous that the government can protect some workers and not others and from a human rights point of view you can not justify it .
i think there 's a very strong possibility that people will challenge this in court .
new york has already seen better business because of the smoking ban .
and with the level of public support a full ban has here , i can only see business remaining the same or getting even better .
' level playing field ' what would affect business is if there is are exemptions because there would n't be a level playing field .
the bar where i work started serving paninis and some bar snacks a few months ago but there was a huge debate in the student union at the time .
it is likely the that management will stop serving food if it means that customers will not be able to smoke .
the lse student union confirmed it would have to review food serving policy in all its premises if a partial ban on smoking comes into force .

after just two years , the number of under-fives in the pilot area with no cavities has risen from 10 % to 30 % .
glasgow has one of the worst dental health records in western europe .

the scheme involves replacing sugary snacks with milk and fruit and a regular tooth-brushing regime .
after just two years , the number of under-fives in the pilot area with no cavities has risen from 10 % to 30 % .
glasgow has one of the worst dental health records in western europe .
the health board said the results were akin to introducing fluoride to the water .
nhs greater glasgow was in favour of putting fluoride in the water in an effort to reduce tooth decay .
however , public opposition to fluoridation led it to establish a number of pilot schemes in the most deprived areas .
the children are very good at picking these things up about what is good or bad for your teeth amanda kelly clutha day nursery every child brushes their teeth with fluoride toothpaste at least once a day under the supervision of nursery nurses and sugary drinks have been cut out .
head nursery teacher amanda kelly , of the clutha day nursery in kinning park , glasgow , said snack-time for the children was a tray of chocolate bars when she started in the post three years ago .
however , the children were now encouraged to eat fruit and healthy snacks to help protect their teeth .
ms kelly said : " it 's also about trying to educate them on when to brush their teeth because children do have sugary snacks in the house .
they are very good at picking these things up about what is good or bad for your teeth . "
fluoride debate when the children have finished their snacks , the toothbrush bus is brought out .
it is a specially-made washable toy which holds individually named toothbrushes for each child .
ms kelly said she had noticed a difference since the scheme had been introduced , with many of the children having " lovely teeth " and a greater emphasis placed on them having milk or water rather than fizzy drinks .
some children brushed their teeth twice a day in the nursery , she added .
the city health board 's director of public health , linda de caestaker , said while it had not compared the merits of the scheme with having fluoride in the water , the results were " encouraging " .
she added : " but it 's by tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste so people are getting fluoride through a different route .
" it would still be a very effective public health intervention to have fluoridation in the water and these interventions have to be across the whole population . "

fifteen operators , including vodafone , orange , t-mobile and china mobile have agreed to work together to make it easy to im across networks .
the motivation to get im working on mobiles is driven by its huge success on the net .
by getting people using im on a mobile instead of a pc , the operators believe they can start to generate decent amounts of money for data services .
the mobile phone industry is looking to repeat the success of text messaging .
in december , british mobile users sent 3.1 billion text messages , more than ever before according to the mobile data association .
all those short messages add up to big bucks for operators .
up to 20 % of their profits , according to some estimates , result from the relatively high price customers pay every time they tap out a text .
message matters third-generation mobile networks make the whole im experience more bearable .
" you can implement im in a more satisfactory way because of improved bandwidth and reduced latency , " said john delaney , principal analyst at consultancy ovum . "
operators have a high degree of control over price and user conditions .
but within two to three years that will be out of their control " john delaney , ovum third-generation networks can carry more data and move it around far faster so messages really can be instant .
this is important because im conversations typically involve more back and forth than text message chats and it ensures that the experience is similar to that enjoyed online .
" the technology is not the barrier any more , " said john hoffman , chief executive of mobile im firm fast mobile .
" the devices are out there and they have the data capabilities to handle this . "
the big problem , said mr hoffman , were the splits between the operators of the online im networks .
the messaging networks of aol , yahoo and microsoft were almost closed shops , said mr hoffman making it very difficult for mobile firms to offer access to them all at once .
the networks are starting to link to each other but only slowly .
if the mobile operators have learned anything from text messages , it is that interoperability across networks is absolutely key to making it popular .
the agreement announced at the 3gsm mobile phone trade fair in barcelona is designed to tackle some of these obstacles .
under the initiative , the 15 operators covering 700 million mobile phone users have agreed to use a single standard for im , which would work across networks .
the operators are looking to launch instant messaging mobile services later this year .
but mr hoffman said work also needed to be done on handsets to make im conversations easy to follow .
at the moment most of the interface software on phones simply arrange messages by when they arrive .
far better would be to arrange them by both conversational thread and time .
another complication that needs taking into account , said mr hoffman , was the fact that im conversations are often between large groups of people rather than one-to-one like text messages .
cash call operators are also worried that committing to im could dilute their brand .
all the big names in im are net-based and no operator wants to hand over that much control to what may become a competitor .
yahoo , microsoft and google have all made moves on messaging , be it instant or e-mail , on phones .
this helps explain , said ovum 's mr delaney , all the partnerships being signed between the net 's im giants and mobile operators .
this works well for both sides as the operators see more use of data services and the im firms get experience with the mobile world .
" operators still have a fairly strong role as the gatekeeper on what people do on the net through their mobile telephone , " he said .
but , said mr delaney , this role as gatekeeper will be steadily eroded as im firms get more aggressive and consumers realise that what they do online , they can now do via their phone .
" operators have a high degree of control over price and user conditions , " said mr delaney , " but within two to three years that will be out of their control . "

microsoft is signing deals with other im networks yahoo , microsoft and google have all made moves on messaging , be it instant or e-mail , on phones .
this helps explain , said ovum 's mr delaney , all the partnerships being signed between the net 's im giants and mobile operators .
this works well for both sides as the operators see more use of data services and the im firms get experience with the mobile world .
" operators still have a fairly strong role as the gatekeeper on what people do on the net through their mobile telephone , " he said .
but , said mr delaney , this role as gatekeeper will be steadily eroded as im firms get more aggressive and consumers realise that what they do online , they can now do via their phone .
" operators have a high degree of control over price and user conditions , " said mr delaney , " but within two to three years that will be out of their control . "

fifteen operators , including vodafone , orange , t-mobile and china mobile have agreed to work together to make it easy to im across networks .
the motivation to get im working on mobiles is driven by its huge success on the net .
by getting people using im on a mobile instead of a pc , the operators believe they can start to generate decent amounts of money for data services .
the mobile phone industry is looking to repeat the success of text messaging .
in december , british mobile users sent 3.1 billion text messages , more than ever before according to the mobile data association .
all those short messages add up to big bucks for operators .
up to 20 % of their profits , according to some estimates , result from the relatively high price customers pay every time they tap out a text .
message matters third-generation mobile networks make the whole im experience more bearable .
" you can implement im in a more satisfactory way because of improved bandwidth and reduced latency , " said john delaney , principal analyst at consultancy ovum .
operators have a high degree of control over price and user conditions .
but within two to three years that will be out of their control john delaney , ovum third-generation networks can carry more data and move it around far faster so messages really can be instant .
this is important because im conversations typically involve more back and forth than text message chats and it ensures that the experience is similar to that enjoyed online .
" the technology is not the barrier any more , " said john hoffman , chief executive of mobile im firm fast mobile .
" the devices are out there and they have the data capabilities to handle this . "
the big problem , said mr hoffman , were the splits between the operators of the online im networks .
the messaging networks of aol , yahoo and microsoft were almost closed shops , said mr hoffman making it very difficult for mobile firms to offer access to them all at once .
the networks are starting to link to each other but only slowly .
if the mobile operators have learned anything from text messages , it is that interoperability across networks is absolutely key to making it popular .
the agreement announced at the 3gsm mobile phone trade fair in barcelona is designed to tackle some of these obstacles .
under the initiative , the 15 operators covering 700 million mobile phone users have agreed to use a single standard for im , which would work across networks .
the operators are looking to launch instant messaging mobile services later this year .
but mr hoffman said work also needed to be done on handsets to make im conversations easy to follow .
at the moment most of the interface software on phones simply arrange messages by when they arrive .
far better would be to arrange them by both conversational thread and time .
another complication that needs taking into account , said mr hoffman , was the fact that im conversations are often between large groups of people rather than one-to-one like text messages .
