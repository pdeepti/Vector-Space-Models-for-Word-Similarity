iran 's foreign minister has already said he was willing to send a team of " independent investigators " to visit former nazi death camps across europe . foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said the teams would be comprised of people " who are not sympathetic to those who committed the crimes and who are not sympathetic to the zionist regime -lrb- israel -rrb- .

ahmadinejad , an ultra-conservative who came to power in a shock victory last june , has provoked international condemnation with a string of anti-israeli remarks and by embracing the cause of holocaust revisionists .
his comments include labelling israel a " tumor " that should be " wiped off the map . "
he has also claimed that the holocaust was a western invention used to justify the creation of the jewish state . the un security council has condemned ahmadinejad 's blatantly anti-semitic statements and un secretary general kofi annan has cancelled a planned visit to tehran in november . in germany , where holocaust denial is a crime , chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly admonished ahmadinejad .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .

noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .

rescuers have pulled several dozen bodies from under the collapsed roof of an exhibition hall in poland .
the death toll is expected to rise as hopes fade of finding survivors in the rubble . rescue teams searched in bitter cold sunday for victims buried when the roof of an exhibition hall in the southern polish town of katowice collapsed during an international gathering of pigeon enthusiasts , killing at least 65 people and injuring 160 . the death toll continued to rise steadily through sunday as emergency crews battling extreme cold used floodlights and hand tools to dig through the snow and debris of the building .
the modern exhibition hall , which caved in apparently under the weight of snow around 5:30 pm -lrb- 1630 gmt -rrb- saturday afternoon , is roughly the size of a soccer field and was thought to have held at least 700 people a spokesman for the provincial governor confirmed that so far 65 people had died and fire brigade officials were saying several dozen could still be under the rubble .
dog rescue teams have begun combing the site for survivors . " we have n't managed to find anyone alive yet , " lukasz kusion , a dog rescue team member told tvn24 television .

visitors at the fair told reporters a thousand people had attended the event . early reports from hospitals indicate belgians , dutch and germans could be among the victims . what caused the collapse ? although it is still too early to say for certain , the fire brigade and police on the scene said the weight of snow on the metal roof had caused the roof to collapse .
however , the building 's manager told polish television that snow had been regularly cleared from the roof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers at a collapsed skating rink in bad reichenhall , germany , jan 2 , 2006 .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .

" " it would be good for mr. blair to participate in the holocaust seminar in tehran , " the islamic republic 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters on sunday . " he can also contribute with an article .
if he wants to defend the holocaust -lrb- the fact that it happened -rrb- in that article , he can do so .
we will give him the time to read out his article so others can hear his point of view , " asefi said . the conference , news of which has alarmed many in europe , is slated to take place in the coming spring , asefi said . an exercise in free speech ? leaders in germany and britain have sharply criticized the announcement of the conference and plans to invite notorious holocaust deniers as a further example of iran 's dangerous strategy of provocation and anti-semitism . iran has presented the conference as an exercise in free speech , where asefi said blair " can say the kind of things he can not say in london . " " for half a century , the defenders of the holocaust have used every tribune to defend their position , and now they have to listed to others , " the foreign ministry spokesman said . will blair attend ? a british embassy spokesman in tehran declined to speculate on whether or not blair would attend the conference , but promised that " if we get a formal invitation , obviously we 'll pass it on to number 10 -lrb- downing street , where the prime minister resides -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad earlier in the month , blair lashed out at the planned meeting as " shocking , ridiculous , and stupid . "
he said ahmadinejad , who publicly doubted 6 million jews had been killed in world war ii , " should come and see the evidence of the holocaust himself in the countries of europe . " asefi replied by saying one would have to see when the president of iran has time for a close up tour of those places .
iran 's foreign minister has already said he was willing to send a team of " independent investigators " to visit former nazi death camps across europe . foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said the teams would be comprised of people " who are not sympathetic to those who committed the crimes and who are not sympathetic to the zionist regime -lrb- israel -rrb- . " international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp auschwitz in januar 1945 .
ahmadinejad , an ultra-conservative who came to power in a shock victory last june , has provoked international condemnation with a string of anti-israeli remarks and by embracing the cause of holocaust revisionists .
his comments include labelling israel a " tumor " that should be " wiped off the map . "
he has also claimed that the holocaust was a western invention used to justify the creation of the jewish state . the un security council has condemned ahmadinejad 's blatantly anti-semitic statements and un secretary general kofi annan has cancelled a planned visit to tehran in november . in germany , where holocaust denial is a crime , chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly admonished ahmadinejad .

visitors at the fair told reporters a thousand people had attended the event . early reports from hospitals indicate belgians , dutch and germans could be among the victims . what caused the collapse ? although it is still too early to say for certain , the fire brigade and police on the scene said the weight of snow on the metal roof had caused the roof to collapse .
however , the building 's manager told polish television that snow had been regularly cleared from the roof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers at a collapsed skating rink in bad reichenhall , germany , jan 2 , 2006 .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .

rescuers have pulled several dozen bodies from under the collapsed roof of an exhibition hall in poland .
the death toll is expected to rise as hopes fade of finding survivors in the rubble . rescue teams searched in bitter cold sunday for victims buried when the roof of an exhibition hall in the southern polish town of katowice collapsed during an international gathering of pigeon enthusiasts , killing at least 65 people and injuring 160 . the death toll continued to rise steadily through sunday as emergency crews battling extreme cold used floodlights and hand tools to dig through the snow and debris of the building .
the modern exhibition hall , which caved in apparently under the weight of snow around 5:30 pm -lrb- 1630 gmt -rrb- saturday afternoon , is roughly the size of a soccer field and was thought to have held at least 700 people a spokesman for the provincial governor confirmed that so far 65 people had died and fire brigade officials were saying several dozen could still be under the rubble .
dog rescue teams have begun combing the site for survivors . " we have n't managed to find anyone alive yet , " lukasz kusion , a dog rescue team member told tvn24 television .
" with every minute , chances are getting slimmer because of low temperatures , " he told the polish broadcaster . a national catastrophe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services work through the night nearly 1,000 police , firefighters and soldiers are involved in the rescue operation and workers from local mines were called in to help sift through the rubble .
after initially only relying on hand tools , heavy cutting equipment and thermal gear were brought in on sunday . it is the largest rescue operation in recent polish history . " a catastrophe on this scale has never happened in poland , " said andrzej urbanski , a senior aide to president lech kaczynski . a national day of mourning was called on sunday as polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz joined several thousand others in katowice 's cathedral of christ the king for a special mass for the victims . the exhibition of racing pigeons , one of the largest in europe , attracted participants from belgium , the netherlands , germany and ukraine , according to the event 's web site .
visitors at the fair told reporters a thousand people had attended the event . early reports from hospitals indicate belgians , dutch and germans could be among the victims . what caused the collapse ? although it is still too early to say for certain , the fire brigade and police on the scene said the weight of snow on the metal roof had caused the roof to collapse .
however , the building 's manager told polish television that snow had been regularly cleared from the roof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers at a collapsed skating rink in bad reichenhall , germany , jan 2 , 2006 .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .

" " it would be good for mr. blair to participate in the holocaust seminar in tehran , " the islamic republic 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters on sunday . " he can also contribute with an article .
if he wants to defend the holocaust -lrb- the fact that it happened -rrb- in that article , he can do so .
we will give him the time to read out his article so others can hear his point of view , " asefi said . the conference , news of which has alarmed many in europe , is slated to take place in the coming spring , asefi said . an exercise in free speech ? leaders in germany and britain have sharply criticized the announcement of the conference and plans to invite notorious holocaust deniers as a further example of iran 's dangerous strategy of provocation and anti-semitism . iran has presented the conference as an exercise in free speech , where asefi said blair " can say the kind of things he can not say in london . " " for half a century , the defenders of the holocaust have used every tribune to defend their position , and now they have to listed to others , " the foreign ministry spokesman said . will blair attend ? a british embassy spokesman in tehran declined to speculate on whether or not blair would attend the conference , but promised that " if we get a formal invitation , obviously we 'll pass it on to number 10 -lrb- downing street , where the prime minister resides -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad earlier in the month , blair lashed out at the planned meeting as " shocking , ridiculous , and stupid . "
he said ahmadinejad , who publicly doubted 6 million jews had been killed in world war ii , " should come and see the evidence of the holocaust himself in the countries of europe . " asefi replied by saying one would have to see when the president of iran has time for a close up tour of those places .
iran 's foreign minister has already said he was willing to send a team of " independent investigators " to visit former nazi death camps across europe . foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said the teams would be comprised of people " who are not sympathetic to those who committed the crimes and who are not sympathetic to the zionist regime -lrb- israel -rrb- . " international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp auschwitz in januar 1945 .
ahmadinejad , an ultra-conservative who came to power in a shock victory last june , has provoked international condemnation with a string of anti-israeli remarks and by embracing the cause of holocaust revisionists .
his comments include labelling israel a " tumor " that should be " wiped off the map . "
he has also claimed that the holocaust was a western invention used to justify the creation of the jewish state . the un security council has condemned ahmadinejad 's blatantly anti-semitic statements and un secretary general kofi annan has cancelled a planned visit to tehran in november . in germany , where holocaust denial is a crime , chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly admonished ahmadinejad .
she will be discussing the subject with regional leaders during her first trip to the middle east as german chancellor on jan .

" " for half a century , the defenders of the holocaust have used every tribune to defend their position , and now they have to listed to others , " the foreign ministry spokesman said . will blair attend ? a british embassy spokesman in tehran declined to speculate on whether or not blair would attend the conference , but promised that " if we get a formal invitation , obviously we 'll pass it on to number 10 -lrb- downing street , where the prime minister resides -rrb- .

" asefi replied by saying one would have to see when the president of iran has time for a close up tour of those places .
iran 's foreign minister has already said he was willing to send a team of " independent investigators " to visit former nazi death camps across europe . foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said the teams would be comprised of people " who are not sympathetic to those who committed the crimes and who are not sympathetic to the zionist regime -lrb- israel -rrb- . " international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp auschwitz in januar 1945 .
ahmadinejad , an ultra-conservative who came to power in a shock victory last june , has provoked international condemnation with a string of anti-israeli remarks and by embracing the cause of holocaust revisionists .
his comments include labelling israel a " tumor " that should be " wiped off the map . "
he has also claimed that the holocaust was a western invention used to justify the creation of the jewish state . the un security council has condemned ahmadinejad 's blatantly anti-semitic statements and un secretary general kofi annan has cancelled a planned visit to tehran in november . in germany , where holocaust denial is a crime , chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly admonished ahmadinejad .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .

" " it would be good for mr. blair to participate in the holocaust seminar in tehran , " the islamic republic 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters on sunday . " he can also contribute with an article .
if he wants to defend the holocaust -lrb- the fact that it happened -rrb- in that article , he can do so .
we will give him the time to read out his article so others can hear his point of view , " asefi said . the conference , news of which has alarmed many in europe , is slated to take place in the coming spring , asefi said . an exercise in free speech ? leaders in germany and britain have sharply criticized the announcement of the conference and plans to invite notorious holocaust deniers as a further example of iran 's dangerous strategy of provocation and anti-semitism . iran has presented the conference as an exercise in free speech , where asefi said blair " can say the kind of things he can not say in london . " " for half a century , the defenders of the holocaust have used every tribune to defend their position , and now they have to listed to others , " the foreign ministry spokesman said . will blair attend ? a british embassy spokesman in tehran declined to speculate on whether or not blair would attend the conference , but promised that " if we get a formal invitation , obviously we 'll pass it on to number 10 -lrb- downing street , where the prime minister resides -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad earlier in the month , blair lashed out at the planned meeting as " shocking , ridiculous , and stupid . "
he said ahmadinejad , who publicly doubted 6 million jews had been killed in world war ii , " should come and see the evidence of the holocaust himself in the countries of europe . " asefi replied by saying one would have to see when the president of iran has time for a close up tour of those places .
iran 's foreign minister has already said he was willing to send a team of " independent investigators " to visit former nazi death camps across europe . foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said the teams would be comprised of people " who are not sympathetic to those who committed the crimes and who are not sympathetic to the zionist regime -lrb- israel -rrb- . " international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp auschwitz in januar 1945 .
ahmadinejad , an ultra-conservative who came to power in a shock victory last june , has provoked international condemnation with a string of anti-israeli remarks and by embracing the cause of holocaust revisionists .
his comments include labelling israel a " tumor " that should be " wiped off the map . "
he has also claimed that the holocaust was a western invention used to justify the creation of the jewish state . the un security council has condemned ahmadinejad 's blatantly anti-semitic statements and un secretary general kofi annan has cancelled a planned visit to tehran in november . in germany , where holocaust denial is a crime , chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly admonished ahmadinejad .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .

dog rescue teams have begun combing the site for survivors . " we have n't managed to find anyone alive yet , " lukasz kusion , a dog rescue team member told tvn24 television .

visitors at the fair told reporters a thousand people had attended the event . early reports from hospitals indicate belgians , dutch and germans could be among the victims . what caused the collapse ? although it is still too early to say for certain , the fire brigade and police on the scene said the weight of snow on the metal roof had caused the roof to collapse .
however , the building 's manager told polish television that snow had been regularly cleared from the roof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers at a collapsed skating rink in bad reichenhall , germany , jan 2 , 2006 .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work .

rescuers have pulled several dozen bodies from under the collapsed roof of an exhibition hall in poland .
the death toll is expected to rise as hopes fade of finding survivors in the rubble . rescue teams searched in bitter cold sunday for victims buried when the roof of an exhibition hall in the southern polish town of katowice collapsed during an international gathering of pigeon enthusiasts , killing at least 65 people and injuring 160 . the death toll continued to rise steadily through sunday as emergency crews battling extreme cold used floodlights and hand tools to dig through the snow and debris of the building .
the modern exhibition hall , which caved in apparently under the weight of snow around 5:30 pm -lrb- 1630 gmt -rrb- saturday afternoon , is roughly the size of a soccer field and was thought to have held at least 700 people a spokesman for the provincial governor confirmed that so far 65 people had died and fire brigade officials were saying several dozen could still be under the rubble .
dog rescue teams have begun combing the site for survivors . " we have n't managed to find anyone alive yet , " lukasz kusion , a dog rescue team member told tvn24 television .
" with every minute , chances are getting slimmer because of low temperatures , " he told the polish broadcaster . a national catastrophe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services work through the night nearly 1,000 police , firefighters and soldiers are involved in the rescue operation and workers from local mines were called in to help sift through the rubble .
after initially only relying on hand tools , heavy cutting equipment and thermal gear were brought in on sunday . it is the largest rescue operation in recent polish history . " a catastrophe on this scale has never happened in poland , " said andrzej urbanski , a senior aide to president lech kaczynski . a national day of mourning was called on sunday as polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz joined several thousand others in katowice 's cathedral of christ the king for a special mass for the victims . the exhibition of racing pigeons , one of the largest in europe , attracted participants from belgium , the netherlands , germany and ukraine , according to the event 's web site .
visitors at the fair told reporters a thousand people had attended the event . early reports from hospitals indicate belgians , dutch and germans could be among the victims . what caused the collapse ? although it is still too early to say for certain , the fire brigade and police on the scene said the weight of snow on the metal roof had caused the roof to collapse .
however , the building 's manager told polish television that snow had been regularly cleared from the roof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers at a collapsed skating rink in bad reichenhall , germany , jan 2 , 2006 .

the nation 's financially strapped churches are benefiting from the commitment of these benefactors . germany is home to some 15,000 charities and over 100,000 church-affiliated foundations .
and every year , new ones are set up . rupert count strachwitz from berlin 's humboldt university studies the significance of these foundations for society .
he said he 's even noticed the spontaneous launching of charities in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theologian hans küng is the president of the global ethic foundation citing one example , strachwitz refers to a successful businessman who heard theologian hans küng talk about global ethics .
the businessman spontaneously said , " this is something important that i want to do something for , " strachwitz recalls the man saying . the global ethic foundation was hence born .
and well-known theologian küng can since concentrate solely on his work : dialog between the world 's religions . making up for cut subsidies the idea behind foundations is simple .
the benefactor makes part of his assets available , which are in turn profitably invested .
these proceeds are dedicated to a certain purpose : sick children , talented musicians or a school . the canisius college in berlin is an example .
the jesuit school is noted for its high standards , liberal religious education and the comprehensive social commitment of its pupils and teachers .
in the past years , the school faced cuts in subsidies by the archbishopric and the city-state of berlin .
a school foundation now makes up for the difference .
this was the only way to continue maintaining certain projects at the school , said principal klaus mertes . " a library for all pupils , generous scholarships , special courses and much more , which is in danger from the large cuts we 're facing , " mertes said of the projects his school maintains . conserving church heritage not only religious orders take advantage of the benefits of a foundation , though .
churches do so , too .
in the past , for example , a member of a congregation would donate his orchard in order to secure the parish priest 's livelihood - and perhaps in the hope of being amply rewarded in heaven . today , the churches face other problems , such as their diminishing income from church taxes .
a number of congregations can no longer support their churches . the protestant church in germany founded the church building foundation in 1998 in order to save their places of worship from decay .
its head , baron friedrich-leopold von stechow , considers the preservation on churches nearly as a mission . " if you have a small baroque church or a stone church in brandenburg which is crumbling , i think it 's very sad if it disappears , both in terms of imagery and the history of the region , " stechow said .
" but the actual goal should be to get more people back to church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zinna cloister in brandenburg dates back to 1170 a well-kept , appealing church , which is maybe even significant in terms of art history , makes people curious .
maybe even non-christians would see a church for the first time from the inside , especially in eastern germany . in the past years , the church building foundation has saved 130 churches in cooperation with other incentives . not enough to save the church what is striking about these new christian foundations is that most of them are established for a certain project , not for the church as a whole . " if i set up a charity , even for a christian purpose , i still do so as a civic foundation , not an ecclesiastic one , " strachwitz said .
" then , i 'm autonomous . " a church-affiliated organization , on the other hand , would be subject to church administration .
" and a lot of people do n't want that , " he said . these charitable proceeds are anyway not significant enough that they could truly come to the aid of these huge institutions , which churches have become .
foundations are not really rays of hope for the church .
but they play a significant role in promoting christian goals and perhaps getting people to return to the church . elena griepentrog -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .

" a library for all pupils , generous scholarships , special courses and much more , which is in danger from the large cuts we 're facing , " mertes said of the projects his school maintains . conserving church heritage not only religious orders take advantage of the benefits of a foundation , though .
churches do so , too .
in the past , for example , a member of a congregation would donate his orchard in order to secure the parish priest 's livelihood - and perhaps in the hope of being amply rewarded in heaven . today , the churches face other problems , such as their diminishing income from church taxes .
a number of congregations can no longer support their churches . the protestant church in germany founded the church building foundation in 1998 in order to save their places of worship from decay .
its head , baron friedrich-leopold von stechow , considers the preservation on churches nearly as a mission . " if you have a small baroque church or a stone church in brandenburg which is crumbling , i think it 's very sad if it disappears , both in terms of imagery and the history of the region , " stechow said .

" if i set up a charity , even for a christian purpose , i still do so as a civic foundation , not an ecclesiastic one , " strachwitz said .
" then , i 'm autonomous . " a church-affiliated organization , on the other hand , would be subject to church administration .
" and a lot of people do n't want that , " he said . these charitable proceeds are anyway not significant enough that they could truly come to the aid of these huge institutions , which churches have become .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .
" that is not desirable from a social perspective , " the sociologist explained . kyle mckinnon -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , nation of reluctant strikers german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .

" " it would be good for mr. blair to participate in the holocaust seminar in tehran , " the islamic republic 's foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters on sunday . " he can also contribute with an article .
if he wants to defend the holocaust -lrb- the fact that it happened -rrb- in that article , he can do so .
we will give him the time to read out his article so others can hear his point of view , " asefi said . the conference , news of which has alarmed many in europe , is slated to take place in the coming spring , asefi said . an exercise in free speech ? leaders in germany and britain have sharply criticized the announcement of the conference and plans to invite notorious holocaust deniers as a further example of iran 's dangerous strategy of provocation and anti-semitism . iran has presented the conference as an exercise in free speech , where asefi said blair " can say the kind of things he can not say in london . " " for half a century , the defenders of the holocaust have used every tribune to defend their position , and now they have to listed to others , " the foreign ministry spokesman said . will blair attend ? a british embassy spokesman in tehran declined to speculate on whether or not blair would attend the conference , but promised that " if we get a formal invitation , obviously we 'll pass it on to number 10 -lrb- downing street , where the prime minister resides -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad earlier in the month , blair lashed out at the planned meeting as " shocking , ridiculous , and stupid . "
he said ahmadinejad , who publicly doubted 6 million jews had been killed in world war ii , " should come and see the evidence of the holocaust himself in the countries of europe . " asefi replied by saying one would have to see when the president of iran has time for a close up tour of those places .
iran 's foreign minister has already said he was willing to send a team of " independent investigators " to visit former nazi death camps across europe . foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said the teams would be comprised of people " who are not sympathetic to those who committed the crimes and who are not sympathetic to the zionist regime -lrb- israel -rrb- . " international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp auschwitz in januar 1945 .
ahmadinejad , an ultra-conservative who came to power in a shock victory last june , has provoked international condemnation with a string of anti-israeli remarks and by embracing the cause of holocaust revisionists .
his comments include labelling israel a " tumor " that should be " wiped off the map . "

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .

the nation 's financially strapped churches are benefiting from the commitment of these benefactors . germany is home to some 15,000 charities and over 100,000 church-affiliated foundations .
and every year , new ones are set up . rupert count strachwitz from berlin 's humboldt university studies the significance of these foundations for society .
he said he 's even noticed the spontaneous launching of charities in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theologian hans küng is the president of the global ethic foundation citing one example , strachwitz refers to a successful businessman who heard theologian hans küng talk about global ethics .
the businessman spontaneously said , " this is something important that i want to do something for , " strachwitz recalls the man saying . the global ethic foundation was hence born .
and well-known theologian küng can since concentrate solely on his work : dialog between the world 's religions . making up for cut subsidies the idea behind foundations is simple .

the nation 's financially strapped churches are benefiting from the commitment of these benefactors . germany is home to some 15,000 charities and over 100,000 church-affiliated foundations .
and every year , new ones are set up . rupert count strachwitz from berlin 's humboldt university studies the significance of these foundations for society .
he said he 's even noticed the spontaneous launching of charities in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theologian hans küng is the president of the global ethic foundation citing one example , strachwitz refers to a successful businessman who heard theologian hans küng talk about global ethics .
the businessman spontaneously said , " this is something important that i want to do something for , " strachwitz recalls the man saying . the global ethic foundation was hence born .
and well-known theologian küng can since concentrate solely on his work : dialog between the world 's religions . making up for cut subsidies the idea behind foundations is simple .
the benefactor makes part of his assets available , which are in turn profitably invested .
these proceeds are dedicated to a certain purpose : sick children , talented musicians or a school . the canisius college in berlin is an example .
the jesuit school is noted for its high standards , liberal religious education and the comprehensive social commitment of its pupils and teachers .
in the past years , the school faced cuts in subsidies by the archbishopric and the city-state of berlin .
a school foundation now makes up for the difference .
this was the only way to continue maintaining certain projects at the school , said principal klaus mertes . " a library for all pupils , generous scholarships , special courses and much more , which is in danger from the large cuts we 're facing , " mertes said of the projects his school maintains . conserving church heritage not only religious orders take advantage of the benefits of a foundation , though .
churches do so , too .
in the past , for example , a member of a congregation would donate his orchard in order to secure the parish priest 's livelihood - and perhaps in the hope of being amply rewarded in heaven . today , the churches face other problems , such as their diminishing income from church taxes .
a number of congregations can no longer support their churches . the protestant church in germany founded the church building foundation in 1998 in order to save their places of worship from decay .
its head , baron friedrich-leopold von stechow , considers the preservation on churches nearly as a mission . " if you have a small baroque church or a stone church in brandenburg which is crumbling , i think it 's very sad if it disappears , both in terms of imagery and the history of the region , " stechow said .
" but the actual goal should be to get more people back to church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zinna cloister in brandenburg dates back to 1170 a well-kept , appealing church , which is maybe even significant in terms of art history , makes people curious .
maybe even non-christians would see a church for the first time from the inside , especially in eastern germany . in the past years , the church building foundation has saved 130 churches in cooperation with other incentives . not enough to save the church what is striking about these new christian foundations is that most of them are established for a certain project , not for the church as a whole . " if i set up a charity , even for a christian purpose , i still do so as a civic foundation , not an ecclesiastic one , " strachwitz said .
" then , i 'm autonomous . " a church-affiliated organization , on the other hand , would be subject to church administration .
" and a lot of people do n't want that , " he said . these charitable proceeds are anyway not significant enough that they could truly come to the aid of these huge institutions , which churches have become .
foundations are not really rays of hope for the church .
but they play a significant role in promoting christian goals and perhaps getting people to return to the church . elena griepentrog -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .
" but if there are new opportunities for peace , i hope that israel will seize them .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .
" but if there are new opportunities for peace , i hope that israel will seize them .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .

for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .
" but if there are new opportunities for peace , i hope that israel will seize them .

he said ahmadinejad , who publicly doubted 6 million jews had been killed in world war ii , " should come and see the evidence of the holocaust himself in the countries of europe . " asefi replied by saying one would have to see when the president of iran has time for a close up tour of those places .
iran 's foreign minister has already said he was willing to send a team of " independent investigators " to visit former nazi death camps across europe . foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said the teams would be comprised of people " who are not sympathetic to those who committed the crimes and who are not sympathetic to the zionist regime -lrb- israel -rrb- . " international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concentration camp auschwitz in januar 1945 .
ahmadinejad , an ultra-conservative who came to power in a shock victory last june , has provoked international condemnation with a string of anti-israeli remarks and by embracing the cause of holocaust revisionists .
his comments include labelling israel a " tumor " that should be " wiped off the map . "
he has also claimed that the holocaust was a western invention used to justify the creation of the jewish state . the un security council has condemned ahmadinejad 's blatantly anti-semitic statements and un secretary general kofi annan has cancelled a planned visit to tehran in november . in germany , where holocaust denial is a crime , chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly admonished ahmadinejad .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .

" our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .
" but if there are new opportunities for peace , i hope that israel will seize them .

on monday , eu foreign ministers gather in brussels to discuss europe 's political and financial role in the middle east following the hamas victory in palestinian elections last week . the european union might have been prepared for a strong showing by hamas in last week 's palestinian general elections .
but the bloc was not expecting a full-out victory .
and now the eu finds itself uncertain of how to face the winners , despite official statements applauding the palestinians for a successful election – the first free ballot in 10 years . the foreign ministers of the eu are convening on monday to discuss the matter .
their goal is to establish a common line on how to deal with the radical islamist party , which is registered on the eu list of terror organizations .
eu diplomats say time is of the essence , and the europeans should watch how government building progresses and how the politics of hamas develops . if hamas swears off violence and acknowledges israel 's right to exist , that would be a step in the right direction and a signal that the eu can continue channeling extensive financial aid to the palestinian authority without worry .
but the ministers have not gone quite so far as to draft concrete demands for the hamas or to threaten with financial consequences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : militant palestinians in nablus following hamas victory in a legal sense , the eu is forbidden from maintaining financial relations with hamas , ever since the organization was blacklisted as a terrorist group in 2001 .
official political contacts are likewise prohibited .
the only option the eu has to apply pressure to make sure hamas disarms and refrains from violence is to stop the flow of aid to the palestinian territories . half a billion euros in aid last year the eu headquarters in brussels handed out some 280 million euros to the palestinians .
combined with bilateral aid from the 25 eu members , the sum came to over a half a billion euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- .
the eu is the single largest financial backer for the palestinians , and stopping the flow of much-needed cash could seriously put a dent in hamas 's activities . on thursday , the european union pledged continued support for the palestinian economy even after hamas won the legislative elections .
so far no strings have been attached to this offer , but the 25-nation bloc has warned that the new government must be committed to peaceful relations with israel . hamas dismisses financial pressure hamas , for its part , rejected international pressure calling for the party to disarm or risk losing vital aid for the palestinian authority .
senior party leader ismael haniyeh threatened to look for alternative sources of financial support in the arab world if the west cancels its funding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ismail haniyeh salutes supporters " this aid can not be a sword over the heads of the palestinian people and will not be material to blackmail our people , " haniyeh told reuters in an interview saturday .
he added that the party , which was sworn to israel 's destruction , was committed to keeping its arms and fighting . " hamas has many alternatives -lrb- for aid -rrb- , " the party leader said .
" there is much good within our people and we have the arab world and all those who love the oppressed peoples in the world and who stand beside us , " he said without mentioning specific countries to provide aid . recognition of israel meanwhile , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called on israel to cooperate with hamas if the palestinian islamist group renounces all violence .
in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag , the austrian said , " i hope israel will remain open and be prepared to work with all those who respect the following basic principles : the recognition of the state of israel and the renunciation of violence . " " there can be no compromise on these principles , " she said .

the nation 's financially strapped churches are benefiting from the commitment of these benefactors . germany is home to some 15,000 charities and over 100,000 church-affiliated foundations .
and every year , new ones are set up . rupert count strachwitz from berlin 's humboldt university studies the significance of these foundations for society .
he said he 's even noticed the spontaneous launching of charities in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theologian hans küng is the president of the global ethic foundation citing one example , strachwitz refers to a successful businessman who heard theologian hans küng talk about global ethics .
the businessman spontaneously said , " this is something important that i want to do something for , " strachwitz recalls the man saying . the global ethic foundation was hence born .
and well-known theologian küng can since concentrate solely on his work : dialog between the world 's religions . making up for cut subsidies the idea behind foundations is simple .
the benefactor makes part of his assets available , which are in turn profitably invested .
these proceeds are dedicated to a certain purpose : sick children , talented musicians or a school . the canisius college in berlin is an example .
the jesuit school is noted for its high standards , liberal religious education and the comprehensive social commitment of its pupils and teachers .
in the past years , the school faced cuts in subsidies by the archbishopric and the city-state of berlin .
a school foundation now makes up for the difference .
this was the only way to continue maintaining certain projects at the school , said principal klaus mertes . " a library for all pupils , generous scholarships , special courses and much more , which is in danger from the large cuts we 're facing , " mertes said of the projects his school maintains . conserving church heritage not only religious orders take advantage of the benefits of a foundation , though .
churches do so , too .
in the past , for example , a member of a congregation would donate his orchard in order to secure the parish priest 's livelihood - and perhaps in the hope of being amply rewarded in heaven . today , the churches face other problems , such as their diminishing income from church taxes .
a number of congregations can no longer support their churches . the protestant church in germany founded the church building foundation in 1998 in order to save their places of worship from decay .
its head , baron friedrich-leopold von stechow , considers the preservation on churches nearly as a mission . " if you have a small baroque church or a stone church in brandenburg which is crumbling , i think it 's very sad if it disappears , both in terms of imagery and the history of the region , " stechow said .
" but the actual goal should be to get more people back to church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zinna cloister in brandenburg dates back to 1170 a well-kept , appealing church , which is maybe even significant in terms of art history , makes people curious .
maybe even non-christians would see a church for the first time from the inside , especially in eastern germany . in the past years , the church building foundation has saved 130 churches in cooperation with other incentives . not enough to save the church what is striking about these new christian foundations is that most of them are established for a certain project , not for the church as a whole . " if i set up a charity , even for a christian purpose , i still do so as a civic foundation , not an ecclesiastic one , " strachwitz said .
" then , i 'm autonomous . " a church-affiliated organization , on the other hand , would be subject to church administration .
" and a lot of people do n't want that , " he said . these charitable proceeds are anyway not significant enough that they could truly come to the aid of these huge institutions , which churches have become .
foundations are not really rays of hope for the church .
but they play a significant role in promoting christian goals and perhaps getting people to return to the church . elena griepentrog -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on religion this collection of dw-world feature stories offers a closer look at religious issues .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects . " our employees earn good money , so they can work as much as the rest of the world , " announced manfred wennemer of german car parts manufacturer continental ag . in an interview with die welt newspaper the ceo justified his reason for extending the company 's work week from 37.5 to 40 hours , a decision that sent ripples through the engineering sector and alerted labor leaders to what is likely to become a contentious debate in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : continental factory in hannover but just as the debate is kicking off , several experts are saying there might be two sides to the issue , and it 's worth looking closer at the discussion .
does a longer work week automatically translate into more productivity and hence a more prospering economy or are there down sides to making employees spend more of their free time on the job for less pay ? keeping the competitive edge continental is not alone in its move toward increasing the work week .
at a growing number of companies , workers and their labor union representatives are conceding to a longer work week in hopes of keeping their jobs .
that 's a stark contrast to the boom times of the 1980s and early 90s when labor unions managed to convince major companies like volkswagen to reduce the work week in turn for hiring more workers . but now unions are beginning to lose their clout at the negotiating table , while pressure to compete with other parts of the world is greater than ever .
germany 's high wages coupled with short working weeks is just not competitive any more , no matter how good the product is .
for shareholders , it 's the bottom line that counts and that usually means fewer employers , working more for less pay . tim noonan , spokesman for the international confederation of free trade unions in brussels has witnessed this development .
he has watched as , one after another , trade unions make concessions to employers in recent years . " we do n't think that is the way in which successful companies should be looking , they should be looking to provide their workers with a good income , a reasonable level of working hours and not trying to squeeze more and more work out of every last worker , " he said . creating more jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen reduced its work week in the early 90s noonan maintains that it would be better in the long-run for companies to establish shorter work weeks , which in return helps create more jobs .
this was a policy several unions adhered to in the 1990s , but has since fallen out of favor at the negotiating table .
noonan admits unions are facing an uphill fight against profits , but says there are some positive developments in europe .
in scandinavia , for example , the trade unions have adapted to the demands of globalization without sacrificing their voice in labor policy . gehard bosch , the vice president of the institute for work and technology near cologne , sees the northern european countries as a good model for germany .
they have gone a long way in cooperating with employers to implement modern business strategies and rely on new technology .
and all that is paying off in terms of successful international corporations .
at the same time , though , the unions have managed to keep the core of the welfare state . living to work ? while the move toward a longer work week picks up momentum in germany , many are wondering what ever became of the old adage that one should be " working to live , not living to work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female employee builds telephones at siemens karen shire , a sociologist who studies work life at the university of duisburg-essen , has argued against increasing hours on the job .
" it 's not socially desirable to have more than 40 hours a week at work , " she said .
" the more time you spend at work , the less time with family , the less time on cultural activities , " she explained . the discussion on extending the work week goes well beyond the obvious , shire said .
at the same time the work week lengthens , there is a declining birthrate .
women are working more and longer .
it is becoming more difficult to have more than one child or even one at all .

the nation 's financially strapped churches are benefiting from the commitment of these benefactors . germany is home to some 15,000 charities and over 100,000 church-affiliated foundations .
and every year , new ones are set up . rupert count strachwitz from berlin 's humboldt university studies the significance of these foundations for society .
he said he 's even noticed the spontaneous launching of charities in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theologian hans küng is the president of the global ethic foundation citing one example , strachwitz refers to a successful businessman who heard theologian hans küng talk about global ethics .
the businessman spontaneously said , " this is something important that i want to do something for , " strachwitz recalls the man saying . the global ethic foundation was hence born .
and well-known theologian küng can since concentrate solely on his work : dialog between the world 's religions . making up for cut subsidies the idea behind foundations is simple .
the benefactor makes part of his assets available , which are in turn profitably invested .
these proceeds are dedicated to a certain purpose : sick children , talented musicians or a school . the canisius college in berlin is an example .
the jesuit school is noted for its high standards , liberal religious education and the comprehensive social commitment of its pupils and teachers .
in the past years , the school faced cuts in subsidies by the archbishopric and the city-state of berlin .
a school foundation now makes up for the difference .
this was the only way to continue maintaining certain projects at the school , said principal klaus mertes . " a library for all pupils , generous scholarships , special courses and much more , which is in danger from the large cuts we 're facing , " mertes said of the projects his school maintains . conserving church heritage not only religious orders take advantage of the benefits of a foundation , though .
churches do so , too .
in the past , for example , a member of a congregation would donate his orchard in order to secure the parish priest 's livelihood - and perhaps in the hope of being amply rewarded in heaven . today , the churches face other problems , such as their diminishing income from church taxes .
a number of congregations can no longer support their churches . the protestant church in germany founded the church building foundation in 1998 in order to save their places of worship from decay .
its head , baron friedrich-leopold von stechow , considers the preservation on churches nearly as a mission . " if you have a small baroque church or a stone church in brandenburg which is crumbling , i think it 's very sad if it disappears , both in terms of imagery and the history of the region , " stechow said .
" but the actual goal should be to get more people back to church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zinna cloister in brandenburg dates back to 1170 a well-kept , appealing church , which is maybe even significant in terms of art history , makes people curious .
maybe even non-christians would see a church for the first time from the inside , especially in eastern germany . in the past years , the church building foundation has saved 130 churches in cooperation with other incentives . not enough to save the church what is striking about these new christian foundations is that most of them are established for a certain project , not for the church as a whole . " if i set up a charity , even for a christian purpose , i still do so as a civic foundation , not an ecclesiastic one , " strachwitz said .
" then , i 'm autonomous . " a church-affiliated organization , on the other hand , would be subject to church administration .
" and a lot of people do n't want that , " he said . these charitable proceeds are anyway not significant enough that they could truly come to the aid of these huge institutions , which churches have become .
foundations are not really rays of hope for the church .

the nation 's financially strapped churches are benefiting from the commitment of these benefactors . germany is home to some 15,000 charities and over 100,000 church-affiliated foundations .
and every year , new ones are set up . rupert count strachwitz from berlin 's humboldt university studies the significance of these foundations for society .
he said he 's even noticed the spontaneous launching of charities in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theologian hans küng is the president of the global ethic foundation citing one example , strachwitz refers to a successful businessman who heard theologian hans küng talk about global ethics .
the businessman spontaneously said , " this is something important that i want to do something for , " strachwitz recalls the man saying . the global ethic foundation was hence born .
and well-known theologian küng can since concentrate solely on his work : dialog between the world 's religions . making up for cut subsidies the idea behind foundations is simple .
the benefactor makes part of his assets available , which are in turn profitably invested .
these proceeds are dedicated to a certain purpose : sick children , talented musicians or a school . the canisius college in berlin is an example .
the jesuit school is noted for its high standards , liberal religious education and the comprehensive social commitment of its pupils and teachers .
in the past years , the school faced cuts in subsidies by the archbishopric and the city-state of berlin .
a school foundation now makes up for the difference .
this was the only way to continue maintaining certain projects at the school , said principal klaus mertes . " a library for all pupils , generous scholarships , special courses and much more , which is in danger from the large cuts we 're facing , " mertes said of the projects his school maintains . conserving church heritage not only religious orders take advantage of the benefits of a foundation , though .
churches do so , too .
in the past , for example , a member of a congregation would donate his orchard in order to secure the parish priest 's livelihood - and perhaps in the hope of being amply rewarded in heaven . today , the churches face other problems , such as their diminishing income from church taxes .
a number of congregations can no longer support their churches . the protestant church in germany founded the church building foundation in 1998 in order to save their places of worship from decay .
its head , baron friedrich-leopold von stechow , considers the preservation on churches nearly as a mission . " if you have a small baroque church or a stone church in brandenburg which is crumbling , i think it 's very sad if it disappears , both in terms of imagery and the history of the region , " stechow said .
" but the actual goal should be to get more people back to church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zinna cloister in brandenburg dates back to 1170 a well-kept , appealing church , which is maybe even significant in terms of art history , makes people curious .
maybe even non-christians would see a church for the first time from the inside , especially in eastern germany . in the past years , the church building foundation has saved 130 churches in cooperation with other incentives . not enough to save the church what is striking about these new christian foundations is that most of them are established for a certain project , not for the church as a whole .

the girl , who has not been named , fell ill at a primary school on wednesday .
she is now said to be recovering .
a spokesman for glasgow city council said the girl was admitted to hospital " on an emergency basis with what appeared to be heroin intoxication " .
strathclyde police and social services have launched an investigation .
drug abuse a city council spokesman said on saturday night : " we are monitoring the situation and the ongoing case discussion will continue on monday . "
authorities were alerted when the girl appeared to fall asleep in the classroom .
nhs greater glasgow said it could not comment on individual cases .
gaille mccann , from mothers against drugs , a group set up after a 13-year-old boy from glasgow became the youngest victim of heroin in britain , told the bbc drug use was growing among younger people .
" i think we have to realise that .
i 'm not saying that it 's a common occurrence , but it 's not unheard of either .
" and i think that what we have to accept now is that drugs have just become part of our society and i think what we also know is that the age that people are using drugs is getting younger and younger . "
" this story gives further reinforcement , if any were needed , that we must keep up our broad approach to tackling drug abuse in society " hugh henry deputy justice minister scotland 's deputy justice minister , hugh henry , expressed concern , saying : " everyone is shocked when they hear about such a young person 's life being put at risk .
" this story gives further reinforcement , if any were needed , that we must keep up our broad approach to tackling drug abuse in society .
" that includes working to educate people through measures such as our advertising campaigns and requiring all schools to provide health education , including educating children about the dangers of drugs , through the five-14 curriculum guidelines for schools . "
he said some children may be more at risk than others .
an action plan is to be launched later this year to support children living in drug-taking households , he said .

mr kember , 74 , of north london , was seized in baghdad with two canadians and an american on 26 november .
the video - the first news of the men for seven weeks - says they will be killed if the kidnappers ' demand that iraqi prisoners are freed is not met .
the foreign office is assessing the tape , which was aired by al-jazeera tv .
peace workers a foreign office spokesman said : " it is a relief to see norman kember and his friends and colleagues still alive after so long without word , and we are urgently assessing the video .
we continue to do all we can . "
timeline of abduction 26 november : norman kember abducted along with three other peace workers 30 november : video footage of the hostages aired on al-jazeera 2 december : second video of the hostages aired .
their captors threaten to kill them unless their demands are met by 8 december 8 december : third video is aired on al-jazeera showing mr kember and us hostage tom fox wearing orange jumpsuits , blindfolded and shackled .
the captors ' deadline is extended to 10 december 28 january : new video of hostages , dated 21 january , aired on al-jazeera how events unfolded hope and fear at tape mr kember 's fellow captives are canadians james loney , 41 , and harmeet singh sooden , 32 , and american tom fox , 54 .
the group were travelling with canadian-based international peace group christian peacemaker teams when they were seized by a group calling itself the swords of truth .
al-jazeera said it had aired the whole of the latest recording of the men , which was about 55 seconds long , but the qatar-based tv station would not say how it had obtained the tape .
in the video , which is dated 21 january and shows the four hostages standing against a wall , the men appear to be speaking but their words are not audible .
instead it includes a message from the kidnappers repeating their demand that all iraqi prisoners be freed .
friends ' prayers the kidnappers had originally set a deadline of 8 december for this demand to be met .
this was later extended by two days to 10 december and there had been no news of the hostages since .
rebecca johnson , spokeswoman for christian peacemaker teams in canada , said it was relieved to see the men alive on the tape .
we have to work very fast now .
no deadline may mean they could be at the end of their tether anas altikriti muslim association of britain wife makes appeal muslim group 's plea " this news is an answer to our prayers .
we continue to hope and pray for their release , " she said .
anas altikriti , of the muslim association of britain , who has been campaigning in the middle east for mr kember 's release , said the video showed there had been " some kind of breakthrough " in the efforts to communicate with the captors .
he said he still did not know who was holding the men or where they were , but the video was a positive sign that they were still being held by the same group .
' threatening terms ' however , he added : " there are some positives out of all this , but we have to work very fast now .
no deadline may mean they could be at the end of their tether . "
the reverend alan betteridge , a friend of mr kember for more than 40 years , said he was concerned the kidnappers were still making the same demands " couched in these threatening terms " .
however , he said mr kember 's wife , pat , was " coping very bravely and strongly " .
bbc correspondent nicholas witchell , in baghdad , said the group was making political demands which could not be met .
he said the us had released 420 prisoners , including five women , two days ago but there were many thousands of people still in detention .

she was offered hope after a cardiff local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- member said it was highly likely to approve the drug .
the welsh assembly government said commissioning the drug was up to lhbs .
" i will carry on until this bureaucracy ends and this highly successful drug is available to women like me , " said ms sullivan , who has a teenage son and daughter .
she has the backing of barbara clark , a 49-year-old from somerset who took her fight to obtain the anti-cancer drug to the european court of human rights , and who is now in remission from the disease .

" in some ways its more important for me to get the drug - as a desperate preventative , " said ms sullivan .
she has joined a growing number of women across the uk who are arguing for the treatment - which costs up to £ 30,000 for a year - to be made available on the nhs .
' other local priorities ' it is reported that her local health board in cardiff has agreed that patients who meet the criteria for herceptin should be given the drug before it is officially licensed in the uk in march a cardiff local health board spokeswoman told the western mail : " they -lrb- the patients who need herceptin -rrb- could receive it in the meantime .
the decision for the longer term will be take in march " . "
lhbs would also need to consider the risks involved in prescribing a drug outside of its product licence " welsh assembly government gareth neale , the chairman of the cardiff lhb committee which makes recommendations on prescribing such drugs told the bbc wales news website : " in all the surrounding circumstances , it would be highly likely that the lhb would authorise it . "
but ms sullivan said her fight for the drug to be made available across wales would continue whether she is successful in getting the drug or not .
" i want every woman in wales to be offered herceptin when the medical treatment decrees they are going to benefit from it . "
" i have plenty of friends who will support me in this and the only reason i will leave is to go for my infusion -lrb- of herceptin -rrb- " .
an assembly government spokeswoman said : " there is nothing to prevent lhbs in wales from commissioning herceptin .
" it would , however , need to be weighed against other local priorities at this early stage before full evaluation .
" lhbs would also need to consider the risks involved in prescribing a drug outside of its product licence .
" it will be a number of months before this drug is licensed for safe use in wales and england and nice -lrb- national institute for clinical excellence -rrb- has published its guidance .
" in the meantime , guidance which will be issued shortly to the nhs to help prepare for implementing trastuzumab -lrb- herceptin -rrb- should it be licensed and positively appraised by nice . "
