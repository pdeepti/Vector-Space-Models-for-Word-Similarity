this would have consequences depending on the season and region . " this is a jump in temperature we have not had for thousands of years , " said andreas troge , head of the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- , a branch of the german environment ministry . in the winter , the uba computer models predicted up to a third more precipitation for some mountain ranges in southern germany - but not in alpine regions , where only a sixth of the current average amount of snow is expected .
summers are forecast to be up to 30 percent drier in much of the country , increasing the danger of forest fires and hampering river transportation . climate cha n ge at germa n y 's door " we finally have a more exact picture of how and where climate change affects germany , " troge said .
" climate change is not only happening in greenland and the arctic but also right here at our front door . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less water in german rivers will hinder cargo shipments the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere will largely determine the severity of climate change effects , according to the researchers ' report . but people wo n't have to wait another 94 years to see the effects of global warming , troge added .
extreme weather conditions in the last 10 years have cost germany about 16.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- and could jump to 27 billion euros by 2050 , according to the uba report . a study by the bavarian environment ministry also pointed out that floods , like those recently experienced in eastern germany and eastern europe would become more common , according to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's environment minister . admitting that the exact effects of global warming are extremely difficult to predict , daniela jacob of the max planck institute , said that melting glaciers and prolonged draughts would be the unavoidable weather of the future . two ways to limit effects of global warmi n g troge said two courses of action are required to limit the consequences of climate change . " we have to begin adjusting our energy consumption and at the same time do more to limit the worldwide temperature increase to two degrees celsius , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troge wants germans to re-evaluate where they get their energy in order to achieve those targets , germany would need to reduce its emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 and rely more on renewable energy .
the 1997 koyto protocol said 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels by 2012 - goals a december study reported only two european nations , britain and sweden , were on target to meet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 the low-pay way to reenter the job market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i work willingly for one euro " reads the poster one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .
participation in the project is limited to one year and a social worker also counsels those taking part-time work to look around for other job opportunities in the meantime , be that talking to tradesmen , looking for internships or filling out job applications .
camill has been looking since july .
he applied for four jobs and got invited to one interview . " that must mean i 'm doing something right and it give me the courage to keep at it , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were it not for these kinds of programs , many youths would simply be hanging out after the bike job , camill has an internship as a painter and varnisher lined up and is hoping that he 's find an apprenticeship by the summer . the radstation has employed about 250 since it was opened five years ago .
about 20 percent of the new hires leave shortly after they start work .
of the rest , about half go on to get jobs or apprenticeships . for some , life after the bike shop does n't run as smoothly as hoped .
two-and-a-half years ago , david spent two months repairing bikes at the radstation . " i took a new job after that , but it did n't work out with the pay and i was unemployed again , " he said .
" now i 'm back here . " his contract runs until august 1 and in the meantime he 's looking for a traineeship program to begin in the fall , preferably as a mechanic .
for him and many of these young men , something like that would be a dream come true . mathias bölinger -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de theater 's unemployed sing for their supper the controversial hartz iv labor reforms have been a fact of life for the unemployed for over a year now .

but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .

but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 the low-pay way to reenter the job market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i work willingly for one euro " reads the poster one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

this would have consequences depending on the season and region . " this is a jump in temperature we have not had for thousands of years , " said andreas troge , head of the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- , a branch of the german environment ministry . in the winter , the uba computer models predicted up to a third more precipitation for some mountain ranges in southern germany - but not in alpine regions , where only a sixth of the current average amount of snow is expected .
summers are forecast to be up to 30 percent drier in much of the country , increasing the danger of forest fires and hampering river transportation . climate cha n ge at germa n y 's door " we finally have a more exact picture of how and where climate change affects germany , " troge said .
" climate change is not only happening in greenland and the arctic but also right here at our front door . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less water in german rivers will hinder cargo shipments the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere will largely determine the severity of climate change effects , according to the researchers ' report . but people wo n't have to wait another 94 years to see the effects of global warming , troge added .
extreme weather conditions in the last 10 years have cost germany about 16.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- and could jump to 27 billion euros by 2050 , according to the uba report . a study by the bavarian environment ministry also pointed out that floods , like those recently experienced in eastern germany and eastern europe would become more common , according to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's environment minister . admitting that the exact effects of global warming are extremely difficult to predict , daniela jacob of the max planck institute , said that melting glaciers and prolonged draughts would be the unavoidable weather of the future . two ways to limit effects of global warmi n g troge said two courses of action are required to limit the consequences of climate change .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .
participation in the project is limited to one year and a social worker also counsels those taking part-time work to look around for other job opportunities in the meantime , be that talking to tradesmen , looking for internships or filling out job applications .
camill has been looking since july .
he applied for four jobs and got invited to one interview . " that must mean i 'm doing something right and it give me the courage to keep at it , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were it not for these kinds of programs , many youths would simply be hanging out after the bike job , camill has an internship as a painter and varnisher lined up and is hoping that he 's find an apprenticeship by the summer . the radstation has employed about 250 since it was opened five years ago .
about 20 percent of the new hires leave shortly after they start work .
of the rest , about half go on to get jobs or apprenticeships . for some , life after the bike shop does n't run as smoothly as hoped .
two-and-a-half years ago , david spent two months repairing bikes at the radstation . " i took a new job after that , but it did n't work out with the pay and i was unemployed again , " he said .
" now i 'm back here . " his contract runs until august 1 and in the meantime he 's looking for a traineeship program to begin in the fall , preferably as a mechanic .
for him and many of these young men , something like that would be a dream come true . mathias bölinger -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de theater 's unemployed sing for their supper the controversial hartz iv labor reforms have been a fact of life for the unemployed for over a year now .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .
participation in the project is limited to one year and a social worker also counsels those taking part-time work to look around for other job opportunities in the meantime , be that talking to tradesmen , looking for internships or filling out job applications .
camill has been looking since july .
he applied for four jobs and got invited to one interview . " that must mean i 'm doing something right and it give me the courage to keep at it , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were it not for these kinds of programs , many youths would simply be hanging out after the bike job , camill has an internship as a painter and varnisher lined up and is hoping that he 's find an apprenticeship by the summer . the radstation has employed about 250 since it was opened five years ago .
about 20 percent of the new hires leave shortly after they start work .
of the rest , about half go on to get jobs or apprenticeships . for some , life after the bike shop does n't run as smoothly as hoped .
two-and-a-half years ago , david spent two months repairing bikes at the radstation . " i took a new job after that , but it did n't work out with the pay and i was unemployed again , " he said .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .
participation in the project is limited to one year and a social worker also counsels those taking part-time work to look around for other job opportunities in the meantime , be that talking to tradesmen , looking for internships or filling out job applications .
camill has been looking since july .
he applied for four jobs and got invited to one interview . " that must mean i 'm doing something right and it give me the courage to keep at it , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were it not for these kinds of programs , many youths would simply be hanging out after the bike job , camill has an internship as a painter and varnisher lined up and is hoping that he 's find an apprenticeship by the summer . the radstation has employed about 250 since it was opened five years ago .
about 20 percent of the new hires leave shortly after they start work .
of the rest , about half go on to get jobs or apprenticeships . for some , life after the bike shop does n't run as smoothly as hoped .
two-and-a-half years ago , david spent two months repairing bikes at the radstation . " i took a new job after that , but it did n't work out with the pay and i was unemployed again , " he said .
" now i 'm back here . " his contract runs until august 1 and in the meantime he 's looking for a traineeship program to begin in the fall , preferably as a mechanic .

" the president of the central council of jews in germany , dr paul spiegel , died in the early hours of this morning , aged 68 , in düsseldorf after a long , hard illness , " the council said in a statement .
it added that he had been suffering from leukaemia . spiegel , who served as the vice president of the central council of jews since 1993 , took over the top post in 1999 after the death of ignatz bubis .
he thus served as the highest political and religious representative for the estimated 110 , 000 jews in germany including immigrants from the former soviet union , making it the third-largest jewish community in western europe . " this is an almost indescribable loss , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council , told afp .

his father survived the concentration camps of buchenwald , auschwitz and dachau .
paul spiegel 's older sister , rosa , was captured by the nazis .
the last known news of her was that she had been taken to the death camp of bergen-belsen .
paul spiegel wrote about the events in his book " at home again ? " spiegel 's professional career began in 1958 as an editor with the jewish newspaper allgemeinen jüdischen wochenzeitung .
from 1960 onwards , spiegel worked as a political correspondent for a number of german and foreign newspapers .
in 1973 and 1974 , he worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine mode und wohnen or " fashion and living . "
for the next 12 years he worked as a public relations executive and entrepreneur .
spiegel was married and had two daughters . a strong moral voice as the president of the central council of jews in germany , spiegel was known for his frank style .
during the angry protests in the muslim world triggered by a controversial cartoon of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper , spiegel strongly criticized violence and at the same time urged " more sensibility for the religious feelings of muslims . "
spiegel also praised new german chancellor angela merkel , saying she had managed to " win back the faith of the people in the political leadership of the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel with chancellor merkel on sunday , merkel paid warm tribute to spiegel . " he spoke out when others stayed quiet .
his commitment to moral courage , tolerance and mutual respect and his rejection of xenophobia and anti-semitism set new standards , " merkel said in a statement . german president horst köhler called spiegel a " great german patriot . " " our country has lost a man who made an important contribution to the communities living in germany , " köhler said . indeed , spiegel was a tireless proponent of the jews in germany and a strong moral voice , warning germans of indifference and silent acceptance of anti-semitism in the face of increasing far-right acts of violence and xenophobic attacks . he urged germans to give out " clear signals that the non-jewish majority wants to have us and our jewish communities in this country . " spiegel signed an accord in january 2003 with then-chancellor gerhard schröder which gave the council the same legal status as the country 's main churches and annual government support of 3 million euros . the central council said it expected discussions about electing spiegel 's successor to begin after a month 's mourning . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

" the president of the central council of jews in germany , dr paul spiegel , died in the early hours of this morning , aged 68 , in düsseldorf after a long , hard illness , " the council said in a statement .
it added that he had been suffering from leukaemia . spiegel , who served as the vice president of the central council of jews since 1993 , took over the top post in 1999 after the death of ignatz bubis .
he thus served as the highest political and religious representative for the estimated 110 , 000 jews in germany including immigrants from the former soviet union , making it the third-largest jewish community in western europe . " this is an almost indescribable loss , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council , told afp . " paul spiegel was a builder of bridges who was well-respected beyond religious circles .
he will be very difficult to replace . " holocaust survivor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born on dec .
31 , 1937 in warendorf in münsterland in the german state of northrhine-westphalia , spiegel 's family fled to brussels to escape nazi persecution .
spiegel went into hiding with a farmer 's family in flanders .
his father survived the concentration camps of buchenwald , auschwitz and dachau .
paul spiegel 's older sister , rosa , was captured by the nazis .
the last known news of her was that she had been taken to the death camp of bergen-belsen .
paul spiegel wrote about the events in his book " at home again ? " spiegel 's professional career began in 1958 as an editor with the jewish newspaper allgemeinen jüdischen wochenzeitung .
from 1960 onwards , spiegel worked as a political correspondent for a number of german and foreign newspapers .
in 1973 and 1974 , he worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine mode und wohnen or " fashion and living . "
for the next 12 years he worked as a public relations executive and entrepreneur .
spiegel was married and had two daughters . a strong moral voice as the president of the central council of jews in germany , spiegel was known for his frank style .
during the angry protests in the muslim world triggered by a controversial cartoon of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper , spiegel strongly criticized violence and at the same time urged " more sensibility for the religious feelings of muslims . "
spiegel also praised new german chancellor angela merkel , saying she had managed to " win back the faith of the people in the political leadership of the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel with chancellor merkel on sunday , merkel paid warm tribute to spiegel . " he spoke out when others stayed quiet .
his commitment to moral courage , tolerance and mutual respect and his rejection of xenophobia and anti-semitism set new standards , " merkel said in a statement . german president horst köhler called spiegel a " great german patriot . " " our country has lost a man who made an important contribution to the communities living in germany , " köhler said . indeed , spiegel was a tireless proponent of the jews in germany and a strong moral voice , warning germans of indifference and silent acceptance of anti-semitism in the face of increasing far-right acts of violence and xenophobic attacks . he urged germans to give out " clear signals that the non-jewish majority wants to have us and our jewish communities in this country . " spiegel signed an accord in january 2003 with then-chancellor gerhard schröder which gave the council the same legal status as the country 's main churches and annual government support of 3 million euros . the central council said it expected discussions about electing spiegel 's successor to begin after a month 's mourning . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .

our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .

but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .
participation in the project is limited to one year and a social worker also counsels those taking part-time work to look around for other job opportunities in the meantime , be that talking to tradesmen , looking for internships or filling out job applications .
camill has been looking since july .
he applied for four jobs and got invited to one interview . " that must mean i 'm doing something right and it give me the courage to keep at it , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were it not for these kinds of programs , many youths would simply be hanging out after the bike job , camill has an internship as a painter and varnisher lined up and is hoping that he 's find an apprenticeship by the summer . the radstation has employed about 250 since it was opened five years ago .
about 20 percent of the new hires leave shortly after they start work .
of the rest , about half go on to get jobs or apprenticeships . for some , life after the bike shop does n't run as smoothly as hoped .
two-and-a-half years ago , david spent two months repairing bikes at the radstation . " i took a new job after that , but it did n't work out with the pay and i was unemployed again , " he said .
" now i 'm back here . " his contract runs until august 1 and in the meantime he 's looking for a traineeship program to begin in the fall , preferably as a mechanic .

this would have consequences depending on the season and region . " this is a jump in temperature we have not had for thousands of years , " said andreas troge , head of the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- , a branch of the german environment ministry . in the winter , the uba computer models predicted up to a third more precipitation for some mountain ranges in southern germany - but not in alpine regions , where only a sixth of the current average amount of snow is expected .
summers are forecast to be up to 30 percent drier in much of the country , increasing the danger of forest fires and hampering river transportation . climate cha n ge at germa n y 's door " we finally have a more exact picture of how and where climate change affects germany , " troge said .
" climate change is not only happening in greenland and the arctic but also right here at our front door . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less water in german rivers will hinder cargo shipments the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere will largely determine the severity of climate change effects , according to the researchers ' report . but people wo n't have to wait another 94 years to see the effects of global warming , troge added .
extreme weather conditions in the last 10 years have cost germany about 16.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- and could jump to 27 billion euros by 2050 , according to the uba report . a study by the bavarian environment ministry also pointed out that floods , like those recently experienced in eastern germany and eastern europe would become more common , according to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's environment minister . admitting that the exact effects of global warming are extremely difficult to predict , daniela jacob of the max planck institute , said that melting glaciers and prolonged draughts would be the unavoidable weather of the future . two ways to limit effects of global warmi n g troge said two courses of action are required to limit the consequences of climate change . " we have to begin adjusting our energy consumption and at the same time do more to limit the worldwide temperature increase to two degrees celsius , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troge wants germans to re-evaluate where they get their energy in order to achieve those targets , germany would need to reduce its emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 and rely more on renewable energy .
the 1997 koyto protocol said 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels by 2012 - goals a december study reported only two european nations , britain and sweden , were on target to meet .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .
participation in the project is limited to one year and a social worker also counsels those taking part-time work to look around for other job opportunities in the meantime , be that talking to tradesmen , looking for internships or filling out job applications .
camill has been looking since july .
he applied for four jobs and got invited to one interview . " that must mean i 'm doing something right and it give me the courage to keep at it , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were it not for these kinds of programs , many youths would simply be hanging out after the bike job , camill has an internship as a painter and varnisher lined up and is hoping that he 's find an apprenticeship by the summer . the radstation has employed about 250 since it was opened five years ago .
about 20 percent of the new hires leave shortly after they start work .
of the rest , about half go on to get jobs or apprenticeships . for some , life after the bike shop does n't run as smoothly as hoped .
two-and-a-half years ago , david spent two months repairing bikes at the radstation . " i took a new job after that , but it did n't work out with the pay and i was unemployed again , " he said .
" now i 'm back here . " his contract runs until august 1 and in the meantime he 's looking for a traineeship program to begin in the fall , preferably as a mechanic .

this would have consequences depending on the season and region . " this is a jump in temperature we have not had for thousands of years , " said andreas troge , head of the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- , a branch of the german environment ministry . in the winter , the uba computer models predicted up to a third more precipitation for some mountain ranges in southern germany - but not in alpine regions , where only a sixth of the current average amount of snow is expected .
summers are forecast to be up to 30 percent drier in much of the country , increasing the danger of forest fires and hampering river transportation . climate cha n ge at germa n y 's door " we finally have a more exact picture of how and where climate change affects germany , " troge said .
" climate change is not only happening in greenland and the arctic but also right here at our front door . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less water in german rivers will hinder cargo shipments the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere will largely determine the severity of climate change effects , according to the researchers ' report . but people wo n't have to wait another 94 years to see the effects of global warming , troge added .
extreme weather conditions in the last 10 years have cost germany about 16.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- and could jump to 27 billion euros by 2050 , according to the uba report . a study by the bavarian environment ministry also pointed out that floods , like those recently experienced in eastern germany and eastern europe would become more common , according to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's environment minister . admitting that the exact effects of global warming are extremely difficult to predict , daniela jacob of the max planck institute , said that melting glaciers and prolonged draughts would be the unavoidable weather of the future . two ways to limit effects of global warmi n g troge said two courses of action are required to limit the consequences of climate change . " we have to begin adjusting our energy consumption and at the same time do more to limit the worldwide temperature increase to two degrees celsius , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troge wants germans to re-evaluate where they get their energy in order to achieve those targets , germany would need to reduce its emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 and rely more on renewable energy .
the 1997 koyto protocol said 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels by 2012 - goals a december study reported only two european nations , britain and sweden , were on target to meet . " if we do not deal with the problems today , we 'll have a high price to pay , " troge said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

this would have consequences depending on the season and region . " this is a jump in temperature we have not had for thousands of years , " said andreas troge , head of the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- , a branch of the german environment ministry . in the winter , the uba computer models predicted up to a third more precipitation for some mountain ranges in southern germany - but not in alpine regions , where only a sixth of the current average amount of snow is expected .
summers are forecast to be up to 30 percent drier in much of the country , increasing the danger of forest fires and hampering river transportation . climate cha n ge at germa n y 's door " we finally have a more exact picture of how and where climate change affects germany , " troge said .
" climate change is not only happening in greenland and the arctic but also right here at our front door . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less water in german rivers will hinder cargo shipments the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere will largely determine the severity of climate change effects , according to the researchers ' report . but people wo n't have to wait another 94 years to see the effects of global warming , troge added .
extreme weather conditions in the last 10 years have cost germany about 16.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- and could jump to 27 billion euros by 2050 , according to the uba report . a study by the bavarian environment ministry also pointed out that floods , like those recently experienced in eastern germany and eastern europe would become more common , according to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's environment minister . admitting that the exact effects of global warming are extremely difficult to predict , daniela jacob of the max planck institute , said that melting glaciers and prolonged draughts would be the unavoidable weather of the future . two ways to limit effects of global warmi n g troge said two courses of action are required to limit the consequences of climate change . " we have to begin adjusting our energy consumption and at the same time do more to limit the worldwide temperature increase to two degrees celsius , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troge wants germans to re-evaluate where they get their energy in order to achieve those targets , germany would need to reduce its emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 and rely more on renewable energy .
the 1997 koyto protocol said 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels by 2012 - goals a december study reported only two european nations , britain and sweden , were on target to meet . " if we do not deal with the problems today , we 'll have a high price to pay , " troge said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

it added that he had been suffering from leukaemia . spiegel , who served as the vice president of the central council of jews since 1993 , took over the top post in 1999 after the death of ignatz bubis .
he thus served as the highest political and religious representative for the estimated 110 , 000 jews in germany including immigrants from the former soviet union , making it the third-largest jewish community in western europe . " this is an almost indescribable loss , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council , told afp .

paul spiegel 's older sister , rosa , was captured by the nazis .

paul spiegel wrote about the events in his book " at home again ? " spiegel 's professional career began in 1958 as an editor with the jewish newspaper allgemeinen jüdischen wochenzeitung .
from 1960 onwards , spiegel worked as a political correspondent for a number of german and foreign newspapers .
in 1973 and 1974 , he worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine mode und wohnen or " fashion and living . "
for the next 12 years he worked as a public relations executive and entrepreneur .
spiegel was married and had two daughters . a strong moral voice as the president of the central council of jews in germany , spiegel was known for his frank style .
during the angry protests in the muslim world triggered by a controversial cartoon of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper , spiegel strongly criticized violence and at the same time urged " more sensibility for the religious feelings of muslims . "
spiegel also praised new german chancellor angela merkel , saying she had managed to " win back the faith of the people in the political leadership of the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel with chancellor merkel on sunday , merkel paid warm tribute to spiegel . " he spoke out when others stayed quiet .
his commitment to moral courage , tolerance and mutual respect and his rejection of xenophobia and anti-semitism set new standards , " merkel said in a statement . german president horst köhler called spiegel a " great german patriot . " " our country has lost a man who made an important contribution to the communities living in germany , " köhler said . indeed , spiegel was a tireless proponent of the jews in germany and a strong moral voice , warning germans of indifference and silent acceptance of anti-semitism in the face of increasing far-right acts of violence and xenophobic attacks . he urged germans to give out " clear signals that the non-jewish majority wants to have us and our jewish communities in this country . " spiegel signed an accord in january 2003 with then-chancellor gerhard schröder which gave the council the same legal status as the country 's main churches and annual government support of 3 million euros . the central council said it expected discussions about electing spiegel 's successor to begin after a month 's mourning . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .

but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .

but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

he thus served as the highest political and religious representative for the estimated 110 , 000 jews in germany including immigrants from the former soviet union , making it the third-largest jewish community in western europe .

paul spiegel 's older sister , rosa , was captured by the nazis .

paul spiegel wrote about the events in his book " at home again ? " spiegel 's professional career began in 1958 as an editor with the jewish newspaper allgemeinen jüdischen wochenzeitung .
from 1960 onwards , spiegel worked as a political correspondent for a number of german and foreign newspapers .
in 1973 and 1974 , he worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine mode und wohnen or " fashion and living . "
for the next 12 years he worked as a public relations executive and entrepreneur .
spiegel was married and had two daughters . a strong moral voice as the president of the central council of jews in germany , spiegel was known for his frank style .
during the angry protests in the muslim world triggered by a controversial cartoon of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper , spiegel strongly criticized violence and at the same time urged " more sensibility for the religious feelings of muslims . "
spiegel also praised new german chancellor angela merkel , saying she had managed to " win back the faith of the people in the political leadership of the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel with chancellor merkel on sunday , merkel paid warm tribute to spiegel . " he spoke out when others stayed quiet .

" " our country has lost a man who made an important contribution to the communities living in germany , " köhler said . indeed , spiegel was a tireless proponent of the jews in germany and a strong moral voice , warning germans of indifference and silent acceptance of anti-semitism in the face of increasing far-right acts of violence and xenophobic attacks . he urged germans to give out " clear signals that the non-jewish majority wants to have us and our jewish communities in this country . " spiegel signed an accord in january 2003 with then-chancellor gerhard schröder which gave the council the same legal status as the country 's main churches and annual government support of 3 million euros . the central council said it expected discussions about electing spiegel 's successor to begin after a month 's mourning . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .
participation in the project is limited to one year and a social worker also counsels those taking part-time work to look around for other job opportunities in the meantime , be that talking to tradesmen , looking for internships or filling out job applications .
camill has been looking since july .
he applied for four jobs and got invited to one interview . " that must mean i 'm doing something right and it give me the courage to keep at it , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were it not for these kinds of programs , many youths would simply be hanging out after the bike job , camill has an internship as a painter and varnisher lined up and is hoping that he 's find an apprenticeship by the summer . the radstation has employed about 250 since it was opened five years ago .
about 20 percent of the new hires leave shortly after they start work .
of the rest , about half go on to get jobs or apprenticeships . for some , life after the bike shop does n't run as smoothly as hoped .
two-and-a-half years ago , david spent two months repairing bikes at the radstation . " i took a new job after that , but it did n't work out with the pay and i was unemployed again , " he said .
" now i 'm back here . " his contract runs until august 1 and in the meantime he 's looking for a traineeship program to begin in the fall , preferably as a mechanic .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .
there are 320 parking places for commuters who ride their bikes in and then catch the train .
in the basement , the men work in a workshop that does simple repairs : changing a bike chain , fixing a flat .
those who work here are primarily supposed to learn what it takes to hold down a job and how to meet challenges at the workplace . " i enjoy learning all the technical things and tinkering around with the bikes , " said leo .
" when something difficult comes up , then you have to think about how you can fix it , what kinds of tools you need to use . " looking for other opportunities for every hour spent with the bikes , leo gets paid exactly one euro , in addition to his unemployment benefits .

" the president of the central council of jews in germany , dr paul spiegel , died in the early hours of this morning , aged 68 , in düsseldorf after a long , hard illness , " the council said in a statement .
it added that he had been suffering from leukaemia . spiegel , who served as the vice president of the central council of jews since 1993 , took over the top post in 1999 after the death of ignatz bubis .
he thus served as the highest political and religious representative for the estimated 110 , 000 jews in germany including immigrants from the former soviet union , making it the third-largest jewish community in western europe . " this is an almost indescribable loss , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council , told afp . " paul spiegel was a builder of bridges who was well-respected beyond religious circles .
he will be very difficult to replace . " holocaust survivor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born on dec .
31 , 1937 in warendorf in münsterland in the german state of northrhine-westphalia , spiegel 's family fled to brussels to escape nazi persecution .
spiegel went into hiding with a farmer 's family in flanders .
his father survived the concentration camps of buchenwald , auschwitz and dachau .
paul spiegel 's older sister , rosa , was captured by the nazis .
the last known news of her was that she had been taken to the death camp of bergen-belsen .
paul spiegel wrote about the events in his book " at home again ? " spiegel 's professional career began in 1958 as an editor with the jewish newspaper allgemeinen jüdischen wochenzeitung .
from 1960 onwards , spiegel worked as a political correspondent for a number of german and foreign newspapers .
in 1973 and 1974 , he worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine mode und wohnen or " fashion and living . "
for the next 12 years he worked as a public relations executive and entrepreneur .
spiegel was married and had two daughters . a strong moral voice as the president of the central council of jews in germany , spiegel was known for his frank style .
during the angry protests in the muslim world triggered by a controversial cartoon of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper , spiegel strongly criticized violence and at the same time urged " more sensibility for the religious feelings of muslims . "
spiegel also praised new german chancellor angela merkel , saying she had managed to " win back the faith of the people in the political leadership of the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel with chancellor merkel on sunday , merkel paid warm tribute to spiegel . " he spoke out when others stayed quiet .
his commitment to moral courage , tolerance and mutual respect and his rejection of xenophobia and anti-semitism set new standards , " merkel said in a statement . german president horst köhler called spiegel a " great german patriot . " " our country has lost a man who made an important contribution to the communities living in germany , " köhler said . indeed , spiegel was a tireless proponent of the jews in germany and a strong moral voice , warning germans of indifference and silent acceptance of anti-semitism in the face of increasing far-right acts of violence and xenophobic attacks . he urged germans to give out " clear signals that the non-jewish majority wants to have us and our jewish communities in this country . " spiegel signed an accord in january 2003 with then-chancellor gerhard schröder which gave the council the same legal status as the country 's main churches and annual government support of 3 million euros . the central council said it expected discussions about electing spiegel 's successor to begin after a month 's mourning . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

this would have consequences depending on the season and region . " this is a jump in temperature we have not had for thousands of years , " said andreas troge , head of the federal environmental agency -lrb- uba -rrb- , a branch of the german environment ministry . in the winter , the uba computer models predicted up to a third more precipitation for some mountain ranges in southern germany - but not in alpine regions , where only a sixth of the current average amount of snow is expected .
summers are forecast to be up to 30 percent drier in much of the country , increasing the danger of forest fires and hampering river transportation . climate cha n ge at germa n y 's door " we finally have a more exact picture of how and where climate change affects germany , " troge said .
" climate change is not only happening in greenland and the arctic but also right here at our front door . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less water in german rivers will hinder cargo shipments the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere will largely determine the severity of climate change effects , according to the researchers ' report . but people wo n't have to wait another 94 years to see the effects of global warming , troge added .
extreme weather conditions in the last 10 years have cost germany about 16.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.5 billion -rrb- and could jump to 27 billion euros by 2050 , according to the uba report . a study by the bavarian environment ministry also pointed out that floods , like those recently experienced in eastern germany and eastern europe would become more common , according to werner schnappauf , bavaria 's environment minister . admitting that the exact effects of global warming are extremely difficult to predict , daniela jacob of the max planck institute , said that melting glaciers and prolonged draughts would be the unavoidable weather of the future . two ways to limit effects of global warmi n g troge said two courses of action are required to limit the consequences of climate change . " we have to begin adjusting our energy consumption and at the same time do more to limit the worldwide temperature increase to two degrees celsius , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troge wants germans to re-evaluate where they get their energy in order to achieve those targets , germany would need to reduce its emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 and rely more on renewable energy .
the 1997 koyto protocol said 150 industrialized nations needed to reduce certain greenhouse gases by five percent from 1990 levels by 2012 - goals a december study reported only two european nations , britain and sweden , were on target to meet .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

" the president of the central council of jews in germany , dr paul spiegel , died in the early hours of this morning , aged 68 , in düsseldorf after a long , hard illness , " the council said in a statement .
it added that he had been suffering from leukaemia . spiegel , who served as the vice president of the central council of jews since 1993 , took over the top post in 1999 after the death of ignatz bubis .
he thus served as the highest political and religious representative for the estimated 110 , 000 jews in germany including immigrants from the former soviet union , making it the third-largest jewish community in western europe . " this is an almost indescribable loss , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council , told afp . " paul spiegel was a builder of bridges who was well-respected beyond religious circles .
he will be very difficult to replace . " holocaust survivor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born on dec .
31 , 1937 in warendorf in münsterland in the german state of northrhine-westphalia , spiegel 's family fled to brussels to escape nazi persecution .
spiegel went into hiding with a farmer 's family in flanders .
his father survived the concentration camps of buchenwald , auschwitz and dachau .
paul spiegel 's older sister , rosa , was captured by the nazis .
the last known news of her was that she had been taken to the death camp of bergen-belsen .
paul spiegel wrote about the events in his book " at home again ? " spiegel 's professional career began in 1958 as an editor with the jewish newspaper allgemeinen jüdischen wochenzeitung .
from 1960 onwards , spiegel worked as a political correspondent for a number of german and foreign newspapers .
in 1973 and 1974 , he worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine mode und wohnen or " fashion and living . "
for the next 12 years he worked as a public relations executive and entrepreneur .
spiegel was married and had two daughters . a strong moral voice as the president of the central council of jews in germany , spiegel was known for his frank style .
during the angry protests in the muslim world triggered by a controversial cartoon of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper , spiegel strongly criticized violence and at the same time urged " more sensibility for the religious feelings of muslims . "
spiegel also praised new german chancellor angela merkel , saying she had managed to " win back the faith of the people in the political leadership of the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel with chancellor merkel on sunday , merkel paid warm tribute to spiegel . " he spoke out when others stayed quiet .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2006 " it 's in europe 's interest to support democracy in congo " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers will be heading to congo under the auspices of the eu as the german army heads to congo to secure polls , german defense minister franz josef jung spoke to dw-tv about the mission 's challenges , the looming soccer world cup and the iran crisis . the german army is to be sent to the congo soon in order to secure the upcoming general election there .
but why should germany lead the peacekeeping force ?
africa is not exactly familiar territory to the german army or bundeswehr . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung the fact is that the un has asked the eu to help safeguard congo 's elections .
it will be a european mission under european leadership .
the deployment is to be directed from the bundeswehr command post in potsdam , but the european union will be responsible for leadership of the whole operation . do you think there 's still a lot of political reservation among germans towards the congo mission ? well , there was initial discussion that a battle group of 1500 german and 4 french soldiers would carry out this mission .
there have been discussions about the make-up of the force .
we also consulted military advice , because not enough other nations , including european ones , were willing to take part .
since then , though , the effort has gained momentum .
and i hope and pray that this will result in a mission with a primarily deterrent effect .
it 's meant to help secure the election and pave the way for democratic development in the congo . the german parliament also has its doubts .
many legislators are going to vote against the congo mission .
is germany 's security being defended in kinshasa ? i assume that the great majority of bundestag deputies will vote in favor of the mission .
and of course there are german interests at stake here .
africa neighbours europe , and we have to expect more migration stress .
the straits of gibraltar are quite narrow and i think that we as both europeans and germans have a security interest in promoting stable development in one of africa 's biggest countries .
the congo is more than six times the size of germany .
establishing a democratic government and stable and peaceful development there would have a positive effect on the entire surrounding region .
and that 's why i think it 's in our security interest to support this european mission , to support democratic development and ensure stability . some 7,000 german troops are currently stationed abroad , mainly in the balkans and afghanistan .
how much scope do you have left for new missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is keeping the peace in afghanistan in terms of future bundeswehr structure , we 've planned 35,000 combat troops , 70 , 000 stabilization troops , and 145,000 support personnel .
the current planning for the overall framework of foreign missions is moving toward 10,000 so we still have scope to provide support .
but i also want to add that in the balkans , where we have over 3,000 troops , we hope we will soon see progress in the kosovo status talks and in elections in bosnia herzegovina , so that we can start thinking about possibly reducing our presence . is the bundeswehr of the future going to be an intervention army ? the bundeswehr too has developed in different ways within this transformation process .
we used to be an army for territorial defense .
when i was a recruit , i experienced our last red alert , when the soviet union marched into czechoslovakia .
after unifying the force , we 've become a more operational army .
and therefore we have a different function , and different tasks .
we help defend germany through our foreign missions , but we also provide aid and assistance within our borders , during natural disasters or major accidents .
we 've made some real contributions in that respect , whether during the massive snowfall in bavaria , or during the bird flu alert on the island of rügen , or the recent flooding in saxony and saxony anhalt . external and internal security can no longer really be treated separately in the age of globalization .
do you think the bundeswehr should provide security at home from time to time ?
during the upcoming world cup perhaps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's furious debate in germany over whether the army should pitch in to help the overstretched police force yes , i think so .
within our constitutional mandate , in case of major accidents , a natural disaster , but also for preventive deployments during the world cup .
we 've already received 100 requests for assistance .
so we 've expanded our capacity from 2,000 to 7,000 soldiers to provide wmd protection at all venues , and to help with first aid .
the troops will also be active in air transport , in a logistical capacity , and as military police .
we 'll also be operating awacs planes for surveillance , to make sure the world cup takes place under safe conditions . you mentioned the constitution , which places tight restrictions on the armed forces .
disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

disaster aid , support during major events ... is that enough for you politically ? no , we need further constitutional clarification because the constitutional court has ruled that in case of air attack , only the police can be used according to article 35 , meaning that of disasters , of major accidents .
we can ward off airborne attacks only with the air force , which means using military means .
the same applies to seaborne attacks , where the navy is necessary .
we need a fundamental clarification here .
earlier the principle was that soldiers are responsible for external security and the police for domestic trouble .
today you ca n't separate the two , because given asymmetrical threats , given terrorism , you have to expect attacks from the air .
you have to expect wmd attacks .
and you have to have a response ready .
our foremost job is to protect the people , and we have to do our job . do you think there 's a serious danger that the conflict over iran 's nuclear program may be resolved with military means ? all our efforts must be directed at reaching a diplomatic solution .
and i am very hopeful that we will achieve that .
if , as a first condition , we stay together , including in the security council , the eu 3 , the united states , russia , and china .
i think that 's a very important and decisive point .
and i hope we will make even more progress , because iran has no interest , it can not have an interest , in being globally isolated , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll succeed with a yes to peaceful use of nuclear energy , but no nuclear arms . condoleezza rice has begun referring again to a coalition of the willing , and judging by reports from washington , planning already seems quite advanced on destroying iran 's nuclear program , for example through air strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahamdinejad remains defiant about his country 's nuclear ambitions it 's been the case that washington has always taken part in the negotiations , including those going on now within the security council , and what we 've agreed on as our common approach .
and i think we 'll continue to make progress in this way .
and it should be our goal , our task , to make sure that iran does not acquire nuclear weapons .
not a single sanction has been imposed yet .
and if we want to solve the matter diplomatically , i think that would be the right way . christian f. trippe interviewed franz josef jung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un approves eu troop deployment to congo the un security council unanimously endorsed a resolution authorizing the deployment of some 1,250 european union troops to help the united nations oversee upcoming polls in the democratic republic of congo .

" the president of the central council of jews in germany , dr paul spiegel , died in the early hours of this morning , aged 68 , in düsseldorf after a long , hard illness , " the council said in a statement .
it added that he had been suffering from leukaemia . spiegel , who served as the vice president of the central council of jews since 1993 , took over the top post in 1999 after the death of ignatz bubis .
he thus served as the highest political and religious representative for the estimated 110 , 000 jews in germany including immigrants from the former soviet union , making it the third-largest jewish community in western europe . " this is an almost indescribable loss , " stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council , told afp . " paul spiegel was a builder of bridges who was well-respected beyond religious circles .
he will be very difficult to replace . " holocaust survivor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born on dec .
31 , 1937 in warendorf in münsterland in the german state of northrhine-westphalia , spiegel 's family fled to brussels to escape nazi persecution .
spiegel went into hiding with a farmer 's family in flanders .
his father survived the concentration camps of buchenwald , auschwitz and dachau .
paul spiegel 's older sister , rosa , was captured by the nazis .
the last known news of her was that she had been taken to the death camp of bergen-belsen .
paul spiegel wrote about the events in his book " at home again ? " spiegel 's professional career began in 1958 as an editor with the jewish newspaper allgemeinen jüdischen wochenzeitung .
from 1960 onwards , spiegel worked as a political correspondent for a number of german and foreign newspapers .
in 1973 and 1974 , he worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine mode und wohnen or " fashion and living . "
for the next 12 years he worked as a public relations executive and entrepreneur .
spiegel was married and had two daughters . a strong moral voice as the president of the central council of jews in germany , spiegel was known for his frank style .
during the angry protests in the muslim world triggered by a controversial cartoon of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper , spiegel strongly criticized violence and at the same time urged " more sensibility for the religious feelings of muslims . "
spiegel also praised new german chancellor angela merkel , saying she had managed to " win back the faith of the people in the political leadership of the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spiegel with chancellor merkel on sunday , merkel paid warm tribute to spiegel . " he spoke out when others stayed quiet .
his commitment to moral courage , tolerance and mutual respect and his rejection of xenophobia and anti-semitism set new standards , " merkel said in a statement . german president horst köhler called spiegel a " great german patriot . " " our country has lost a man who made an important contribution to the communities living in germany , " köhler said . indeed , spiegel was a tireless proponent of the jews in germany and a strong moral voice , warning germans of indifference and silent acceptance of anti-semitism in the face of increasing far-right acts of violence and xenophobic attacks . he urged germans to give out " clear signals that the non-jewish majority wants to have us and our jewish communities in this country . " spiegel signed an accord in january 2003 with then-chancellor gerhard schröder which gave the council the same legal status as the country 's main churches and annual government support of 3 million euros . the central council said it expected discussions about electing spiegel 's successor to begin after a month 's mourning . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

" the threepenny opera " is scheduled to have its opening night on august 11 , three days before the anniversary of the death of the marxist playwright who wrote it with composer kurt weill in 1928 . the musical comedy features weill 's most famous song , " the ballad of mack the knife . " but , if the tune is hummed by people who may never have heard of him or brecht , for germans it remains forever linked to the bohemian spirit of berlin in the days of the weimar republic . " we are on brecht 's turf , " the producer of the play , lukas leuenberger , says simply . a star-studded cast he has hired austrian actor klaus maria brandauer , known to english audiences for his role in the oscar-winning " out of africa , " to direct the play . brandauer has cast punk singer and first-time actor campino , the frontman of the german band " die toten hosen " , in the lead role of the bandit macheath . katrin sass , who starred in the hit film " goodbye , lenin ! " about an east german woman whose son hides the fall of the berlin wall from her , is to play mrs. peachum . theater expert hans-jürgen drescher , head of the publishing house suhrkamp , says the director and the cast will " give a new life to ' the threepenny opera ' , " which he agrees " forever belongs to berlin and its mitte district . " social critique still applies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer bertolt brecht brecht was beginning to explore marxist ideas when he wrote the script and it challenges conventional ideas of property , as well as conventional theater , and delivers a stinging critique of bourgeois society .
the social comment , drescher believes , can also apply to modern times . brecht lived and wrote on the chausseestrasse just down the road from the admiralspalast , which breathed life into the area for more than a hundred years before closing a decade ago . the building sits on a spring and began life as a bath house in 1873 , but in 1910 the " admiralsgartenbadhaus " changed its name to the " eispalast " and became a turn-of-the-century entertainment complex . it kept the baths but added cafes , clubs and a chandelier-lit ice skating rink which doubled up as a ballroom at night .
in 1922 , the ice rink was turned into a theater with more than a thousand seats and the admiralspalast 's reputation as a hedonist haunt grew .
by then its ornate facade also hid a casino , and , legend has it , a brothel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer and " the ballad of mack the knife " creator kurt weill " this used to be a place of excessive partying , " the new owner of the complex , businessman falk walter , told berlin 's tageszeitung recently . the newspaper remarked that the theater , which sits on the part of friedrichstrasse that fell behind the iron curtain , was also a quirky measure of the political climate in berlin . in the nazi era , hitler 's propaganda chief joseph goebbels ordered the decor be made still plusher and the main lodge with its pale blue curtains was known as the " führer loge . "
during communist times it was referred to as the " politburo loge . " hedonist palace turns into socialist stage the theater escaped bombing in world war ii and in 1946 it served as the stage for the forced merger of east germany 's social democratic and communist parties into the socialist unity party of germany . at the time it was housing the deutsche oper while the war-time damage on the opera house was repaired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht testifying before the house un-american activities committee in washington in 1947 brecht , a dedicated communist who fled nazi germany because of his opposition to the regime , had in the meanwhile returned from his exile in hollywood to establish the flourishing berliner ensemble theatre around the corner . the admiralspalast survived for decades as a concert hall for musicals and operettas but finally ended up as cinema just before it was boarded up in 1997 . walter bought it from the berlin city authorities for one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- and has said he is spending 13 million euros more to restore it to its former decadent glory . the casino and the brothel belong to the past but the old art nouveau pools , which black and white photographs from the 1920s show dotted with women in swimsuits , will be restored . walter will also add an opulent cafe , a jazz club and a disco , that will be at home among the trendy shops and restaurants for which friedrichstrasse has become known in its current capitalist incarnation .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some participants might end up working in bike factories , such as this one in saxony-anhalt the radstation is a parking garage and repair shop for bicycles .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program lifts them out of chronic unemployment . the one-euro job program was part of the so-called hartz iv package of welfare and labor market reforms enacted under the government of gerhard schröder .
its proponents say it is a way to get the unemployed , especially those who have been jobless for a long time , back into the habit of working .
reform opponents say it 's nothing more than loan dumping .
harsher voices have equated it to a form of slave labor . but several young men at a bike center at bonn 's main train station who are participating in the program hope the low-paying jobs gives them experience they can use as a stepping stone toward better jobs elsewhere . " i 've always had a weakness for bicycles , " said camill .
" i once worked as a bike courier , but did n't earn much . " he and the others here have poor resumés , spotty employment records , only basic levels of education and often other social problems that have made it difficult for them to find or hold on to work . " i 've had an apprenticeship as a painter , but i had to quit because i had a lot of problems with drugs and things , " said leo . multiple problems these men face a variety of challenges , says erich felten , the bike shop 's manager .
many of them are in debt , do n't have a stable place to live and their command of german can be poor .
in the jargon of germany 's federal employment agency , these people have " multiple challenges . " " the classic , critical point is basically a lack of reliability and punctuality , " said felton .
" and these are key qualifications for an employer . "

much photographed but rarely quoted , she has remained very much a private person .
she has two sons - jonathon and david - with mr prescott , but it was the emergence of a third child that saw the politician 's wife herself make the front pages in 2003 .
it was revealed she had been reunited with the son she had put up for adoption as a teenager in 1955 .
she had looked after him for the first three months of his life , but with her father dead and her mother struggling to make ends meet , she had placed him in a children 's home .
three years later he was adopted by school teacher ted watton and his wife mary , a school district nurse .
john prescott said he had always known about the child his wife had given away , but it was not until a tabloid newspaper tracked down fox-hunting conservative voter paul watton that there was a reunion .
at the time mrs prescott said the reunion with her son was " just absolutely amazing " .
in a rare interview , she told the sunday telegraph of her husband : " we have had a great marriage .
john was wonderful and always knew that there was that little part of me that was always there . "
hair excuse the former hairdresser grew up in chester .
she met her future husband in 1957 while he was the boyfriend of a friend .
she married mr prescott , then a merchant navy steward , in 1961 .
famed for her coiffed hair and striking outfits , it was his wife 's hairdo that john prescott famously blamed in 1999 when he was under fire for riding 250 yards by car from a hotel to labour 's conference in a windy bournemouth .
he deflected criticism by explaining why he had taken the limo : " because of the security reasons for one thing and , second , my wife does n't like to have her hair blown about . "
in 2005 , pauline prescott again made headlines when greenpeace protesters scaled the roof of the couple 's home near hull as a protest .
she was trapped in her bedroom , telling a court later she was " absolutely terrified " and in fear of her life because she at first thought the intruders were terrorists .
now , as newspaper revelations over her husband 's affair with his secretary tracy temple mount , pauline prescott is once again behind closed doors in hull .

" trying to force the clergymen to carry out the ordination ceremony before the -lrb- roman catholic -rrb- church 's approval would be deliberately wrecking china-vatican negotiations , " he told hong kong radio .
taiwan links cardinal zen has been at the forefront of recent efforts to improve relations between beijing and the holy see .
china has both a state-sanctioned roman catholic church but also a bigger , unofficial church that is loyal to the pope .
according to china 's authorities the state-sanctioned church has about four million members , while the vatican says the roman catholic church there has some 10 million worshippers .
china has said it would like better relations with the vatican , but insists that first the holy see must cut its diplomatic links with taiwan .

martyn oates the politics show south west students from across the world come to torbay to learn english , one of the most popular language destinations in the country .
the vetting of people who look after vulnerable youngsters has never been so rigorous .
so it may come as a bit of a shock to know that foreign students , some as young as seven , can stay in this country while learning english at homes where the host families have not been subjected to any kind of vetting process .
it is a loophole in the law which the government is at last getting to grips with .
but not before a couple of shocking incidents in torbay which could have had disastrous consequences .
torbay is a favourite location for foreign students wanting to improve their english .
they learn the language at one of a dozen schools in the resort , while staying with host families nearby .
there were 160 incidents involving foreign students which came to the attention of torbay police last year , anything from name-calling to theft and assault .
initiatives to tackle the problem are already achieving results , but the vetting loophole is the big worry .
there are nearly 400 language schools in this country signed up with english uk which insists on a range of standards from classroom sizes through to security checks on host families .
but another 600 schools across the country are unregulated .
accreditation does give students the kind of reassurance they need .
the main factor inhibiting further expansion of torbay 's language schools is a lack of host families .
and there are concerns that tighter and potentially more costly regulations will not help .
but the accredited language schools know the industry will suffer if there are serious incidents .
compulsory accreditation is still at least two years away .
until then foreign students in this country will continue to be at risk .
we requested an interview with the children 's minister maria eagle , however she was unavailable .
her department issued the following statement : " language schools and other employers should carry out necessary background checks , including seeking crb disclosures , for individuals who care for international students in host accommodation .
" the government has introduced the safeguarding vulnerable groups bill , bringing fundamental reform and proposals for the first centralised vetting and barring system for all those working with children and vulnerable adults . "

to mark the persian new year , the impassive image of the last shah of iran clad in full military dress , has been staring out above the traffic .
there are an estimated 1.65 million people of iranian descent living in the us , and everyone under the age of 25 was not born when the shah died in exile in egypt .
around half of the iranian diaspora lives in california , primarily " tehrangeles " as it is jokingly referred to , and orange county .
most of the families here came to escape the destruction of their way of life following the islamic revolution , which sets them apart from most immigrant groups , with the notable exception of the florida cubans .
status-conscious for iranian monarchists , and those who look fondly on the shah 's billboard , the ayatollahs who have ruled since 1979 are as hated as fidel castro in miami 's " little havana " .
but the community does not speak with one voice - especially the younger , americanised generations , who never experienced life under the shah .
when i pick up the phone and i speak farsi to a friend of mine , it 's like a breath of fresh air neda bolourchi " i do n't think they experienced losing their wealth .
they left the country with it , " said mozhan marno , a young iranian-american actress who finds the politics of many la persian emigres , anachronistic .
she can not relate to their prevailing values , after spending time training and working on the east coast : " there 's a preoccupation with prestige , money , and bmws here , " she said , in an exasperated voice .
in truth , it is a criticism that could be levelled against the whole of los angeles , and a sign perhaps that iranians have assimilated successfully , while maintaining a strong - if romanticised - sense of their deep culture .
westwood boulevard in west la , is home to all things persian , with a confident atmosphere of sophisticated middle-class prosperity .
at the attari sandwich shop , an elegant fountain gurgles away on the patio beneath the loud conversation , which takes place mainly in farsi .
iman and april dress in beverly hills chic but are close to their roots " when i pick up the phone and i speak farsi to a friend of mine , it 's like a breath of fresh air , " said neda bolourchi , a law student who describes her hybrid language as " finglish " - a fusion of farsi and english .
she has more reason than most to be heavily engaged in the crisis-politics of iran right now .
her mother was a passenger on one of the planes which struck the world trade center , nearly five years ago : " we were known for our civilisation ; and all of a sudden , we 've turned into a bunch of terrorists . "
" peoples ' spirit does n't change , we 've retained our civilised society , " she said .
" unfortunately now we 're being ruled by a theocracy .
what you can do here -lrb- in the us -rrb- is change people 's perspective , one person at a time . "
persians she studies hard , and values farsi poetry highly , just like april heidarian , a 23-year-old lunching with friends nearby , dressed in the latest beverly hills chic .
" i think my parents are more worried about that , but i 'm kind of into my own world right now , " she said , when i asked if she was following news of iran 's nuclear brinkmanship .
many iranian papers are on sale in la she feels she has the best of both worlds - iranian and californian : " i balance them both out pretty well , i follow every tradition .
i guess i 'm more americanised in a sense that my parents are n't as strict as other parents . "
her friend iman hunter touched on another sensitive issue .
being mistaken for arabs infuriates persians , but being labelled iranian , is also too political for some : " i love the fact people call us persian , because that 's what we are , " he said .
" i do n't like it when people call us iranian .
it 's not the olympics . "
he is not keen to visit his ancestral homeland , in case he gets forced into military service , but april said her cousin had just visited los angeles , and told her life was just fine in tehran - for those with money .
soccer test the sense of keeping iran 's politics at arms-length , is something that troubles peter shahriari , a lawyer in his late 20s who is also a dedicated stand-up comedian .
talking over drinks after a quick performance at the comedy store club on sunset boulevard , he said the incoherence of young iranians towards their homeland was unacceptable : most of the iranians are against this regime , but still they love their home , bijan khalili " look at the armenians that have been here for a while , they 've produced real artistic and business icons , " he said .
" we 've been here with far greater intellectual and financial resources .

ken armitage and wife anne were trying to reach a pub on dartmoor in time for a cream tea .
mr armitage improvised using his rucksack and a bungee strap , and the couple made it in time for tea .
his musmate walking aid was in line for a best new product award at a leading uk disability show , naidex , at the nec in birmingham .
' wonderful idea ' mr armitage is a geo-physicist and spends his time inventing things , though not usually disability-related products .
" our need was to get to a pub that was serving the best cream teas on dartmoor , " anne armitage told the bbc news website . "
we found a way of transferring energy from the strong muscles in the thigh and back to the ones that were n't working " ken armitage in pictures : naidex 2006 " my husband had this wonderful idea - he took off his rucksack , put a bungee on my foot and i covered the last two kilometres and got there in time for tea . "
the armitages - together with a partner , andrew wynd - have formed a company to market the musmate to the public .
the device consists of a shoulder harness and an elasticated cord connected the wearer 's shoe .
they are hoping it will help people with ms , cerebral palsy , those recovering from strokes and adrenoleukodystrophy , a condition similar to ms.
" my wife 's walking range was down to about 50 or 60 metres , " explained mr armitage .
" aerobic fitness is really important .
just because one muscle group does n't work , that 's not to say the others ca n't do a lot more . "
mr armitage uses the elastic cord to help people whose muscles wo n't allow them to lift their feet during that part of the walking cycle .
" we found a way of transferring energy from the strong muscles in the thigh and back to the ones that were n't working . "
confidence boost the next stage in the product 's development was to have it tested by a larger group of people .
the south-west ms society helped by coming up with around 20 volunteers .
according to mr armitage , over a 90 day period their walking speed increased by more than 100 % .
the volunteers also reported - though this was not measured scientifically - that the distance that they were able to walk increased by up to 600 % .
wearers reported that walking without the musmate had also improved .
" all of my friends at the ms centre asked why i was getting better , " said mrs armitage .
" i thought it was the red wine , but it was n't .
it was the red wine and the musmate together . "
mrs armitage says that the device has significantly increased the amount she can walk as well as restoring her confidence .
" if my husband had n't invented this i would probably be using a wheelchair by now . "
having gone through the testing process and having been approved as a medical aid , the musmate is now on sale to the public .
testing time one of those who tried it out at naidex 2006 was rob woodfield from leicester who is recovering from a stroke .
" what i want to do is to go hill walking , " he said .
mr woodfield spent 10 minutes walking around the exhibition hall at the nec and concluded , " this does seem to work " .
" this has certainly given me the confidence to give it a much longer try , " he said .
the musmate can be used on one or both legs and costs around £ 75 for a single harness and £ 125 for a double version .
the company estimates that there are two million people in europe and north america who could make use of the invention .

the device consists of a shoulder harness and an elasticated cord connected the wearer 's shoe .
they are hoping it will help people with ms , cerebral palsy , those recovering from strokes and adrenoleukodystrophy , a condition similar to ms.
" my wife 's walking range was down to about 50 or 60 metres , " explained mr armitage .
" aerobic fitness is really important .
just because one muscle group does n't work , that 's not to say the others ca n't do a lot more . "
mr armitage uses the elastic cord to help people whose muscles wo n't allow them to lift their feet during that part of the walking cycle .
" we found a way of transferring energy from the strong muscles in the thigh and back to the ones that were n't working . "
confidence boost the next stage in the product 's development was to have it tested by a larger group of people .
the south-west ms society helped by coming up with around 20 volunteers .
anne and ken armitage 's musmate was shortlisted for an award according to mr armitage , over a 90 day period their walking speed increased by more than 100 % .
the volunteers also reported - though this was not measured scientifically - that the distance that they were able to walk increased by up to 600 % .
wearers reported that walking without the musmate had also improved .
" all of my friends at the ms centre asked why i was getting better , " said mrs armitage .
" i thought it was the red wine , but it was n't .
it was the red wine and the musmate together . "
mrs armitage says that the device has significantly increased the amount she can walk as well as restoring her confidence .
" if my husband had n't invented this i would probably be using a wheelchair by now . "
having gone through the testing process and having been approved as a medical aid , the musmate is now on sale to the public .
testing time one of those who tried it out at naidex 2006 was rob woodfield from leicester who is recovering from a stroke .
" what i want to do is to go hill walking , " he said .
mr woodfield spent 10 minutes walking around the exhibition hall at the nec and concluded , " this does seem to work " .
" this has certainly given me the confidence to give it a much longer try , " he said .
the musmate can be used on one or both legs and costs around £ 75 for a single harness and £ 125 for a double version .
the company estimates that there are two million people in europe and north america who could make use of the invention .

ken armitage and wife anne were trying to reach a pub on dartmoor in time for a cream tea .
mr armitage improvised using his rucksack and a bungee strap , and the couple made it in time for tea .
his musmate walking aid was in line for a best new product award at a leading uk disability show , naidex , at the nec in birmingham .
' wonderful idea ' mr armitage is a geo-physicist and spends his time inventing things , though not usually disability-related products .
" our need was to get to a pub that was serving the best cream teas on dartmoor , " anne armitage told the bbc news website .
we found a way of transferring energy from the strong muscles in the thigh and back to the ones that were n't working ken armitage in pictures : naidex 2006 " my husband had this wonderful idea - he took off his rucksack , put a bungee on my foot and i covered the last two kilometres and got there in time for tea . "
the armitages - together with a partner , andrew wynd - have formed a company to market the musmate to the public .
the device consists of a shoulder harness and an elasticated cord connected the wearer 's shoe .
they are hoping it will help people with ms , cerebral palsy , those recovering from strokes and adrenoleukodystrophy , a condition similar to ms.
" my wife 's walking range was down to about 50 or 60 metres , " explained mr armitage .
" aerobic fitness is really important .
just because one muscle group does n't work , that 's not to say the others ca n't do a lot more . "
mr armitage uses the elastic cord to help people whose muscles wo n't allow them to lift their feet during that part of the walking cycle .
" we found a way of transferring energy from the strong muscles in the thigh and back to the ones that were n't working . "
confidence boost the next stage in the product 's development was to have it tested by a larger group of people .
the south-west ms society helped by coming up with around 20 volunteers .
anne and ken armitage 's musmate was shortlisted for an award according to mr armitage , over a 90 day period their walking speed increased by more than 100 % .
the volunteers also reported - though this was not measured scientifically - that the distance that they were able to walk increased by up to 600 % .
wearers reported that walking without the musmate had also improved .
" all of my friends at the ms centre asked why i was getting better , " said mrs armitage .
" i thought it was the red wine , but it was n't .
it was the red wine and the musmate together . "
mrs armitage says that the device has significantly increased the amount she can walk as well as restoring her confidence .
" if my husband had n't invented this i would probably be using a wheelchair by now . "
having gone through the testing process and having been approved as a medical aid , the musmate is now on sale to the public .
testing time one of those who tried it out at naidex 2006 was rob woodfield from leicester who is recovering from a stroke .
" what i want to do is to go hill walking , " he said .

what has she said ?
on how the affair began ms temple began to work for the john prescott in 2001 , becoming his diary manager when the office of the deputy prime minister was created .
" i liked working for him .
i felt privileged , " she told the newspaper .
" we got on very well .
i am quite a flirty , touchy sort of person .
we had adjoining offices and i was in and out of his office countless times a day ; i would rub his arm when he went past me and he would do the same to me .
" but it was all open , in front of people , and i think they just accepted we got on really well .
he was tactile with everyone . "
their relationship changed , she said , when she first went to his flat at admiralty house , in may 2002 , to take him ministerial boxes .
" it was the first time i had been there , and he leaned forward and cupped my face in his hands .
i froze .
" he said : ' i probably should n't have done that . '
and i said : ' no you should n't . '
then i left . "
she said in the following weeks they became " closer and closer " .
on the affair ms temple told how regular sexual encounters took place in mr prescott 's office with the door open while other civil servants worked outside .
on other occasions they took place in mr prescott 's taxpayer-funded flat in admiralty arch - once following the iraq war memorial service .
" i knew what we were doing was risky but we both got carried away , " she said .
she described what occurred in his office on a couple of occasions .
" yes , i did give him sex in the office a couple of times .
" he would usually be going through his ministerial box - maybe things to do with regeneration or the environment .
" things always started with touching .
it might have been me touching his arm or him patting me on the back .
" i would go in for some task with the diary .
" sometimes the touch would start something , we would kiss and things would go on from there . "
she told the paper that on one occasion the mr prescott " got frisky " in the admiralty boardroom - described as a government conference room .
on her attraction to him asked why she kept the affair going for so long , she told the paper she " enjoyed the attention " .
" he was a great boss , and i enjoyed the attention he gave me .
but i was n't into the whole power thing .
" it was n't like i went home thinking : ' oh my god , i 'm sleeping with the deputy prime minister ' .
i do n't think i was looking for a father figure either .
" i truthfully do n't know why i did it .
i think i liked the attention and feeling cared for . "
on his wife and famiily ms temple insisted she never intended to hurt mr prescott 's wife pauline .
" pauline is a fantastic person , i loved her too .
" we had a great relationship and i know she will be devastated .
" i do feel bad about that .
i could n't look at her now .
" i do think he is sincere in his apology .
he is a family man . "
on the end of the affair the relationship lasted two years , she said , before " fading away " .
" it just got to the point where i did n't really want to have sex any more , " she said .
" but we were still very close .
still great friends . "
on the affair becoming public ms temple said she believed the affair was disclosed to a newspaper by a political enemy hoping to force mr prescott out of office .
but she also said she had been abandoned as the storm over the affair broke , receiving just one telephone call from her former lover .
she said : " i feel i have been used and am being used as a scapegoat .
" they have abandoned me and hung me out to dry .
i have been left completely alone . "
when it became clear the affair was going to be exposed , she says she was pleased when mr prescott called her - but the call turned out to be very short .
" are you all right , love " , mr prescott asked her , she told the paper .
" yes i am , but i 'm not , " she replied .
to which , she said , he replied simply : " it 'll be alright . "

their relationship changed , she said , when she first went to his flat at admiralty house , in may 2002 , to take him ministerial boxes .
" it was the first time i had been there , and he leaned forward and cupped my face in his hands .
i froze .
" he said : ' i probably should n't have done that . '
and i said : ' no you should n't . '
then i left . "
she said in the following weeks they became " closer and closer " .
on the affair ms temple told how regular sexual encounters took place in mr prescott 's office with the door open while other civil servants worked outside .
on other occasions they took place in mr prescott 's taxpayer-funded flat in admiralty arch - once following the iraq war memorial service .
" i knew what we were doing was risky but we both got carried away , " she said .
ms temple -lrb- far right -rrb- claimed they had sex shortly after this memorial service she described what occurred in his office on a couple of occasions .
" yes , i did give him sex in the office a couple of times .
" he would usually be going through his ministerial box - maybe things to do with regeneration or the environment .
" things always started with touching .
it might have been me touching his arm or him patting me on the back .
" i would go in for some task with the diary .
" sometimes the touch would start something , we would kiss and things would go on from there . "
she told the paper that on one occasion the mr prescott " got frisky " in the admiralty boardroom - described as a government conference room .
on her attraction to him asked why she kept the affair going for so long , she told the paper she " enjoyed the attention " .
" he was a great boss , and i enjoyed the attention he gave me .
but i was n't into the whole power thing .
" it was n't like i went home thinking : ' oh my god , i 'm sleeping with the deputy prime minister ' .
i do n't think i was looking for a father figure either .
" i truthfully do n't know why i did it .
i think i liked the attention and feeling cared for . "
on his wife and famiily ms temple insisted she never intended to hurt mr prescott 's wife pauline .
" pauline is a fantastic person , i loved her too .
" we had a great relationship and i know she will be devastated .
" i do feel bad about that .
i could n't look at her now .
" i do think he is sincere in his apology .
he is a family man . "
on the end of the affair the relationship lasted two years , she said , before " fading away " .
" it just got to the point where i did n't really want to have sex any more , " she said .
" but we were still very close .
still great friends . "
on the affair becoming public ms temple said she believed the affair was disclosed to a newspaper by a political enemy hoping to force mr prescott out of office .
but she also said she had been abandoned as the storm over the affair broke , receiving just one telephone call from her former lover .
she said : " i feel i have been used and am being used as a scapegoat .
" they have abandoned me and hung me out to dry .
i have been left completely alone . "
when it became clear the affair was going to be exposed , she says she was pleased when mr prescott called her - but the call turned out to be very short .
" are you all right , love " , mr prescott asked her , she told the paper .
" yes i am , but i 'm not , " she replied .
to which , she said , he replied simply : " it 'll be alright . "
