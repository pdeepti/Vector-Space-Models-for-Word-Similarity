audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .

so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .

but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .
audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .
for the time being , vws and skodas will only be fitted together in kaluga . " skoda 's production system , much like vw 's , is based on cooperation with just-in-time suppliers who deliver modules .
so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .

but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .

but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .
audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .
for the time being , vws and skodas will only be fitted together in kaluga . " skoda 's production system , much like vw 's , is based on cooperation with just-in-time suppliers who deliver modules .
so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .
car ownership is by no means as exotic as it was during the soviet union but russia still lags behind its neighbors .
according to the european bank for reconstruction and development , russia has about 157 cars per 1,000 people .
poland , in comparison , has 250 . in contrast to vw 's grand plans , daimlerchrysler has decided against the construction of a mercedes plant in russia .
the conditions of local production have to be worth their while , says daimler 's head in russia , jürgen sauer .
for the time being , he says , conditions just do n't make sense . and anyway , for those russians who have deep enough pockets to purchase luxury cars like a mercedes , right now they prefer the " made in germany " label more than one that reads " made in russia .

but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .

but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .
audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .
for the time being , vws and skodas will only be fitted together in kaluga . " skoda 's production system , much like vw 's , is based on cooperation with just-in-time suppliers who deliver modules .
so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .
car ownership is by no means as exotic as it was during the soviet union but russia still lags behind its neighbors .
according to the european bank for reconstruction and development , russia has about 157 cars per 1,000 people .
poland , in comparison , has 250 . in contrast to vw 's grand plans , daimlerchrysler has decided against the construction of a mercedes plant in russia .
the conditions of local production have to be worth their while , says daimler 's head in russia , jürgen sauer .
for the time being , he says , conditions just do n't make sense . and anyway , for those russians who have deep enough pockets to purchase luxury cars like a mercedes , right now they prefer the " made in germany " label more than one that reads " made in russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2006 european car makers eye russia for expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen hopes the polo will become a car for the russians " made in russia " may not be a label that draws attention of new car buyers .
but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .
audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .
for the time being , vws and skodas will only be fitted together in kaluga . " skoda 's production system , much like vw 's , is based on cooperation with just-in-time suppliers who deliver modules .
so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .
car ownership is by no means as exotic as it was during the soviet union but russia still lags behind its neighbors .
according to the european bank for reconstruction and development , russia has about 157 cars per 1,000 people .
poland , in comparison , has 250 . in contrast to vw 's grand plans , daimlerchrysler has decided against the construction of a mercedes plant in russia .
the conditions of local production have to be worth their while , says daimler 's head in russia , jürgen sauer .
for the time being , he says , conditions just do n't make sense . and anyway , for those russians who have deep enough pockets to purchase luxury cars like a mercedes , right now they prefer the " made in germany " label more than one that reads " made in russia .

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .

biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .
mazurek added : “ some areas have been appointed without a detailed knowledge of what is in them . ”

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .

biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .
there is also the possibility of a court case .
biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .
mazurek added : “ some areas have been appointed without a detailed knowledge of what is in them . ”
recent discussion with poland about natura 2000 poland held discussion about natura 2000 from aug .
25 to 27 in tuczno , poland .
one of the issues addressed was the size and number of protected sites for the 10 new eu member states .

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .
there is also the possibility of a court case .
biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .
mazurek added : “ some areas have been appointed without a detailed knowledge of what is in them . ”

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .

biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .
mazurek added : “ some areas have been appointed without a detailed knowledge of what is in them . ”

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .

poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .

andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .

conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .

but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .
audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .
for the time being , vws and skodas will only be fitted together in kaluga . " skoda 's production system , much like vw 's , is based on cooperation with just-in-time suppliers who deliver modules .
so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .
car ownership is by no means as exotic as it was during the soviet union but russia still lags behind its neighbors .
according to the european bank for reconstruction and development , russia has about 157 cars per 1,000 people .
poland , in comparison , has 250 . in contrast to vw 's grand plans , daimlerchrysler has decided against the construction of a mercedes plant in russia .
the conditions of local production have to be worth their while , says daimler 's head in russia , jürgen sauer .
for the time being , he says , conditions just do n't make sense . and anyway , for those russians who have deep enough pockets to purchase luxury cars like a mercedes , right now they prefer the " made in germany " label more than one that reads " made in russia .

" " i am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address ... which were considered offensive to the sensibility of muslims , " the pope said during the traditional angelus blessing from his summer residence at castel gandolfo outside rome . he stressed that the passages he quoted during a speech at regensburg university tuesday " do not in any way express my personal thought . " " invitation to dialogue " " i hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address , which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue , with great mutual respect , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apology came during a traditional blessing from his summer residence , castel gandolfo , seen here the pope 's comments in germany had sparked widespread condemnation from muslim leaders across the world , amid violent protests reminiscent of those that erupted after a danish newspaper printed cartoons of the prophet mohammed a year ago . his expression of sorrow on sunday was stronger than that of " sincere regret " contained in a vatican statement the day before , but it remained to be seen if it would satisfy muslim demands for an unequivocal personal apology . the angelus blessing marked the pope 's first public appearance since the furor broke over his university lecture , in which he also implicitly linked islam with violence . increased national security his words were greeted with warm applause by the roman catholic faithful who had braved pouring rain to receive the pope 's blessing at castel gandolfo , just south of rome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims around the world angrily protested pope benedict 's remarks the italian interior ministry told police chiefs to raise the level of national security on sunday , amid violent threats by islamist groups overseas . a hardline cleric linked to somalia 's powerful islamist movement called for muslims to " hunt down " and kill the pope , while an armed iraqi group threatened to carry out attacks against rome and the vatican . attacks on churches a third day of attacks on christian places of worship in the palestinain territories saw unknown assailants throw molotov cocktails and a burning tire at two catholic churches in the northern west bank . the pope said the " true meaning " of what he said in germany had been clarified by the vatican 's secretary of state cardinal tarcisio bertone on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apology from vatican secretary of state bertone -lrb- left -rrb- on saturday was widely rejected as insufficient bertone said the pope 's words had been misinterpreted and were meant as a rejection of the religious motivation for violence , " from whatever side it may come . " that explanation had been angrily dismissed by many muslim groups who pressed on with demands for a full and personal apology . calls for apology " the pope made a mistake , he must recognize his mistake and apologize , " said abdel moneim abul futuh , a senior official with egypt 's opposition muslim brotherhood . the scale and intensity of the muslim reaction had cast doubts on the pope 's next scheduled foreign trip in november to turkey . however , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul said sunday that the visit would go ahead as planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish foreign minister abdullah gül " a change is out of the question for us right now , " gul said , while describing the pope 's remarks in germany as " really unfortunate " and a setback for efforts to promote better understanding between religions and cultures . meanwhile , some syrian muslim and christian clergymen expressed satisfaction sunday following pope benedict xvi 's statement . mohammad habash , a legislator and head of the islamic studies centre , said : " i am not happy to see a rift between islam and christians or between the west and the east .
we have to avoid our countries and religions from entering these kinds of conflicts . " calls for dialogue he said the pope has submitted a " clarification and not an apology , " but , habash added : " it is our duty to call for calm and dialogue .
we understand the reasons for -lrb- muslim -rrb- anger , but we do not call for it and we call instead for calm and dialogue . " meanwhile , isidore battikha , the greek catholic bishop of homs in central syria , said " that 's what we were expecting from the pope as the teachings of jesus call for tolerance and moderation . " " we are pleased that he has corrected this mistake and we hope that hearts would remain open between muslims and christians and to go on with the process of coexistence , " he added . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican apology fails to soothe muslim outrage a spokesman for pope benedict xvi saturday apologized to muslims for citing a controversial passage that appeared to link islam to violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2006 european car makers eye russia for expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen hopes the polo will become a car for the russians " made in russia " may not be a label that draws attention of new car buyers .
but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .
audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .
for the time being , vws and skodas will only be fitted together in kaluga . " skoda 's production system , much like vw 's , is based on cooperation with just-in-time suppliers who deliver modules .
so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .
car ownership is by no means as exotic as it was during the soviet union but russia still lags behind its neighbors .
according to the european bank for reconstruction and development , russia has about 157 cars per 1,000 people .
poland , in comparison , has 250 . in contrast to vw 's grand plans , daimlerchrysler has decided against the construction of a mercedes plant in russia .
the conditions of local production have to be worth their while , says daimler 's head in russia , jürgen sauer .
for the time being , he says , conditions just do n't make sense . and anyway , for those russians who have deep enough pockets to purchase luxury cars like a mercedes , right now they prefer the " made in germany " label more than one that reads " made in russia .

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .
there is also the possibility of a court case .
biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .
mazurek added : “ some areas have been appointed without a detailed knowledge of what is in them . ”
recent discussion with poland about natura 2000 poland held discussion about natura 2000 from aug .

biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.09.2006 poland could lose eu funds for environment breaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the endangered brown bear , found in poland is protected under natura 2000 policy protecting areas of significant biodiversity is one of the obligations for new eu members .
however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .
there is also the possibility of a court case .
biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.09.2006 poland could lose eu funds for environment breaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the endangered brown bear , found in poland is protected under natura 2000 policy protecting areas of significant biodiversity is one of the obligations for new eu members .
however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .
there is also the possibility of a court case .
biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .

but some german automakers are betting it will help give them a foothold in eastern markets . when volkswagen chairman bernd pischetrieder signed a contract with russia 's trade and ecomomic ministry in may to build a 370 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- plant in the russian city of kaluga , it may have been the death knell for russian auto makers . with the deal , most of the world 's big auto companies will now be present in the largest of the former soviet union states .
gm , toyota , ford , nissan - and now vw - will avoid large tariffs on their cars , thus hastening the demise of the russian standard bearer , lada . russia does n't excel in auto manufacturing , but it is tops in other areas .
the country 's great wealth in oil , natural gas , and metals , in addition to generating revenue for the government , is creating a new middle class that craves european , japanese and american cars .
between 2003 and 2005 , import makes more than doubled their market share , from 12 to 25 percent . to increase that share , vw will start production of the compact polo in russia .
the russian-built variety will cost just shy of 10,000 euros , making it very competitive with the russian lada , a car plagued with reliability problems .
currently , vw sells around 40,000 cars in russia .
that is supposed to be ramped up to 150,000 by the end of 2010 . strings attached to production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is uncertain if models like the a8 are attractive in russia vw is not the only german maker taking a close look at the large - and potentially very willing - russian market . " we are conducting a feasibility study to see whether it makes sense for audi to go there , and under which conditions , " said till brauner , head of audi russia .
audi is a volkswagen subsidiary . another vw subsidiary , skoda , has plans to build the octavia and fabia models in kaluga , some 160 kilometers southwest of moscow . but moscow has not given the giant auto producers carte blanche to drive its automobile sector to ruin .
to retain tariff advantages granted now , the foreign auto makers will , in future , have to use parts that are made in russia .
for the time being , vws and skodas will only be fitted together in kaluga . " skoda 's production system , much like vw 's , is based on cooperation with just-in-time suppliers who deliver modules .
so it will be mandatory that suppliers be nearby , otherwise the timing and the rhythm just wo n't function , " said skoda board member horst mühl . over time , should imports start selling briskly , german parts suppliers will have to move closer to russian plants , or the carmakers will have to depend on russian parts .
otherwise , they can not sell their cars at competitive prices . not everyone rushing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if a mercedes , then preferably " made in germany " prices affordable for " normal " russians will play a large role if a foreign carmaker wants to succeed in russia .
car ownership is by no means as exotic as it was during the soviet union but russia still lags behind its neighbors .
according to the european bank for reconstruction and development , russia has about 157 cars per 1,000 people .
poland , in comparison , has 250 . in contrast to vw 's grand plans , daimlerchrysler has decided against the construction of a mercedes plant in russia .
the conditions of local production have to be worth their while , says daimler 's head in russia , jürgen sauer .
for the time being , he says , conditions just do n't make sense . and anyway , for those russians who have deep enough pockets to purchase luxury cars like a mercedes , right now they prefer the " made in germany " label more than one that reads " made in russia .

however , the polish government has failed to hold up its end of the deal and may face eu funding blocks for certain projects . in april 2006 , natura 2000 , a branch of the eu directorate-general for the environment , undertook legal action against poland for failing to protect areas of significant biodiversity .
according to nicholas hanley , head of communications for the eu directorate-general for the environment , the infringement procedure was filed against poland because it had been ' ' significantly inefficient " in designating areas for biodiversity protection as stipulated by eu guidelines .
' ' it was made clear to those 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 , they were joining a community and they would have to abide by the rules of the community , " he said .
poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .

biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .
mazurek added : “ some areas have been appointed without a detailed knowledge of what is in them . ”

poland 's failure to designate sufficient biodiversity areas could jeopardize some of the 59.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 75 billion -rrb- allocated to warsaw for 2007 to 2013 , if the funds are to be used for projects seen to be threatening areas of important biodiversity .
there is also the possibility of a court case .
biodiversity protection obligatory for eu members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has doubts about site designation the purpose of the natura 2000 european ecological network program is working with eu member states to protect their most important wildlife areas and species .
the program falls under the birds directive and the habitat directive laws which require the designation of ' ' special protection areas " for birds and ' ' special areas of conservation . "
poland proposed creating 72 special protection areas , but the commission recommended the designation of 140 .
but polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said site designation makes it ' ' practically impossible to build anything , " according to news reports . in a meeting with environmental groups kaczynski said the number of habitats protected under the eu ’ s natura 2000 conservation network should be cut because they hampered vital projects such as motorways .
andreas baumueller , european biodiversity policy officer for the world wildlife fund , thinks the polish government may have misunderstood the purpose of natura 2000 's site designation .
' ' there is a perception that once the site has been designated you lose control of these areas , which is simply not true , " baumueller said .
' ' if people understand their obligations , they will know that an area of biodiversity does not mean the land can not be used at all . "
conflicting information coming from warsaw hanley claims the polish environment ministry conducted an inventory to decide how much space should be set aside under the natura 2000 program , which they initially proposed would be 13 percent of the country .
however , when poland submitted their report to brussels , the government designated only 3 percent of land for site protection .
' ' the insufficiency of their proposal was totally flagrant , there were gaping holes in it geographically , based on inventory they did themselves , " hanley said .
slawomir mazurek , a spokesman for the polish environment ministry , told media sources there had been disagreements by local governments as to which areas were to be designated for protection .
mazurek added : “ some areas have been appointed without a detailed knowledge of what is in them . ”
recent discussion with poland about natura 2000 poland held discussion about natura 2000 from aug .

it may not be the biggest question the party wants to address as it gathers in brighton .
sir menzies has already insisted he is not expecting any " gary cooper high noon " at the conference .
but that , along with a core debate on taxation , is the issue that is already hanging over the event .
the vote over the new leader 's central policy of abandoning mr kennedy 's 50p top tax rate policy in favour of his own green tax proposals is the debate likely to give sir menzies the biggest problem although he insists losing would not represent a threat to his leadership .
it has become the single biggest issue to symbolise a shift away from the previous leader 's stance and stamp the new man 's identity on the party , which has still not entirely recovered from the brutal and bitter removal of mr kennedy over his drinking problem .
so the outcome of the vote on this policy will be seen as the clearest indication of whether sir menzies has finally got a grip on his party and moved on from his predecessor 's era , or whether grassroots members still hanker after the man who took them to great electoral success in the past two general elections .
party bosses seem confident they will win the vote and , as a result , finally draw a line under the leadership issue which has continued to dog sir menzies since the damaging contest earlier in the year .
indeed , some even seem to be relishing a showdown .
leadership challenge anything mr kennedy has to say on the issue might prove pivotal , although it is thought unlikely he will openly oppose it .
if the new policy is thrown out by the conference , however , sir menzies will be put under immense new pressure and a leadership challenge before the next general election - already being whispered about in some quarters - will start looking like a real possibility .
despite continuing good local and by-election results , the new leader has struggled to make his mark and faced persistent claims that he lacks the popular touch and energy of his predecessor .
there is a fear among many lib dems that , with david cameron 's conservatives moving into the centre ground , the party will lose momentum and identity and could slip back into its old position as a poor third in parliament .
and then there will be the two men 's big speeches - mr kennedy will address the conference on tuesday , shortly after the tax vote , and sir menzies will bring it to a close on thursday .
lot to prove mr kennedy 's performance is already being branded his " comeback " speech which will show he has overcome his drink problem and is ready for a place on the frontbench , perhaps in the next re-shuffle .
but his words will be pored over for any sign of his feelings towards sir menzies and whether , as some have suggested , he harbours ambitions to once again lead his party .
as for sir menzies - his first big conference speech as leader needs to be a bit special .
he still has a lot to prove to his party and the wider world .
earlier this year he was forced to slap down failed leadership contender simon hughes for suggesting he would be " judged " at this year 's autumn conference .
he has managed to up his game in the commons and , after a very shaky start , is once again being seen as a serious , heavyweight and statesmanlike performer .
he will need to underpin that in his big speech while giving the party a clear sense of direction and reassuring the grassroots that he will be able to lead them to even greater electoral success .
he will want to leave brighton with all the questions and concerns over his leadership style and policy direction finally answered .

sir menzies has to reassure his party it may not be the biggest question the party wants to address as it gathers in brighton .
sir menzies has already insisted he is not expecting any " gary cooper high noon " at the conference .
but that , along with a core debate on taxation , is the issue that is already hanging over the event .
the vote over the new leader 's central policy of abandoning mr kennedy 's 50p top tax rate policy in favour of his own green tax proposals is the debate likely to give sir menzies the biggest problem although he insists losing would not represent a threat to his leadership .
it has become the single biggest issue to symbolise a shift away from the previous leader 's stance and stamp the new man 's identity on the party , which has still not entirely recovered from the brutal and bitter removal of mr kennedy over his drinking problem .
so the outcome of the vote on this policy will be seen as the clearest indication of whether sir menzies has finally got a grip on his party and moved on from his predecessor 's era , or whether grassroots members still hanker after the man who took them to great electoral success in the past two general elections .
party bosses seem confident they will win the vote and , as a result , finally draw a line under the leadership issue which has continued to dog sir menzies since the damaging contest earlier in the year .
indeed , some even seem to be relishing a showdown .
leadership challenge anything mr kennedy has to say on the issue might prove pivotal , although it is thought unlikely he will openly oppose it .
kennedy is still held in high regard if the new policy is thrown out by the conference , however , sir menzies will be put under immense new pressure and a leadership challenge before the next general election - already being whispered about in some quarters - will start looking like a real possibility .
despite continuing good local and by-election results , the new leader has struggled to make his mark and faced persistent claims that he lacks the popular touch and energy of his predecessor .
there is a fear among many lib dems that , with david cameron 's conservatives moving into the centre ground , the party will lose momentum and identity and could slip back into its old position as a poor third in parliament .
and then there will be the two men 's big speeches - mr kennedy will address the conference on tuesday , shortly after the tax vote , and sir menzies will bring it to a close on thursday .
lot to prove mr kennedy 's performance is already being branded his " comeback " speech which will show he has overcome his drink problem and is ready for a place on the frontbench , perhaps in the next re-shuffle .
hughes suggested leader would be judged but his words will be pored over for any sign of his feelings towards sir menzies and whether , as some have suggested , he harbours ambitions to once again lead his party .
as for sir menzies - his first big conference speech as leader needs to be a bit special .
he still has a lot to prove to his party and the wider world .
earlier this year he was forced to slap down failed leadership contender simon hughes for suggesting he would be " judged " at this year 's autumn conference .

party bosses seem confident they will win the vote and , as a result , finally draw a line under the leadership issue which has continued to dog sir menzies since the damaging contest earlier in the year .
indeed , some even seem to be relishing a showdown .
leadership challenge anything mr kennedy has to say on the issue might prove pivotal , although it is thought unlikely he will openly oppose it .
kennedy is still held in high regard if the new policy is thrown out by the conference , however , sir menzies will be put under immense new pressure and a leadership challenge before the next general election - already being whispered about in some quarters - will start looking like a real possibility .
despite continuing good local and by-election results , the new leader has struggled to make his mark and faced persistent claims that he lacks the popular touch and energy of his predecessor .
there is a fear among many lib dems that , with david cameron 's conservatives moving into the centre ground , the party will lose momentum and identity and could slip back into its old position as a poor third in parliament .
and then there will be the two men 's big speeches - mr kennedy will address the conference on tuesday , shortly after the tax vote , and sir menzies will bring it to a close on thursday .
lot to prove mr kennedy 's performance is already being branded his " comeback " speech which will show he has overcome his drink problem and is ready for a place on the frontbench , perhaps in the next re-shuffle .
hughes suggested leader would be judged but his words will be pored over for any sign of his feelings towards sir menzies and whether , as some have suggested , he harbours ambitions to once again lead his party .
as for sir menzies - his first big conference speech as leader needs to be a bit special .
he still has a lot to prove to his party and the wider world .
earlier this year he was forced to slap down failed leadership contender simon hughes for suggesting he would be " judged " at this year 's autumn conference .
he has managed to up his game in the commons and , after a very shaky start , is once again being seen as a serious , heavyweight and statesmanlike performer .
he will need to underpin that in his big speech while giving the party a clear sense of direction and reassuring the grassroots that he will be able to lead them to even greater electoral success .
he will want to leave brighton with all the questions and concerns over his leadership style and policy direction finally answered .

south street in st austell is closed so contractors can continue taking down the old tesco building as part of the £ 40m project .
contractors have also applied for road closures for the next two sundays , but if the demolition is straightforward the final closure may not be necessary .
the site is expected to be clear by the christmas holiday season .
shop wrangling the knocking down of the former tesco site will be followed by the stripping out of old clothes shops and the engine house on the south side of aylmer square .
the demolition will help make way for a new development including shops , restaurants , a cinema and 60 new homes .
work to start bringing down the old supermarket was begun on saturday by 13-year-old james johns , from foxhole , who won a competition .
the redevelopment is due to be completed in 2010 .
a compulsory purchase order was made on the site by the south west regional development agency after wrangling between tesco and the local council delayed the work .

seven cameras in middlesbrough town centre have a facility , which allows operators to bark orders at those involved in anti-social behaviour .
officials hope the additions to the town 's 160 cameras will help to further reduce street crime .
it is the latest crime prevention move for middlesbrough , whose elected mayor is ray mallon , the former senior police officer who was dubbed robocop .
barry coppinger , middlesbrough council 's executive member for community safety , said : " cctv is making middlesbrough safer and this added facility will make it more effective .
' community safety ' " for example , if an operative now sees someone dropping litter , they can tell them to pick it up , or if they see an incident starting to get out of hand , they can give advice that will hopefully nip it in the bud .
" i think that it will give people extra confidence as they go about their business and re-enforce the message that middlesbrough is a place that is constantly thinking about community safety . "
a similar " talking " system was piloted in wiltshire in 2003 .
mr coppinger added : " middlesbrough 's cctv network is one of the most comprehensive in the uk and in 2005 was responsible for helping net 678 offenders .
" it was also responsible for helping locate 15 missing people . "

seven cameras in middlesbrough town centre have a facility , which allows operators to bark orders at those involved in anti-social behaviour .
officials hope the additions to the town 's 160 cameras will help to further reduce street crime .
it is the latest crime prevention move for middlesbrough , whose elected mayor is ray mallon , the former senior police officer who was dubbed robocop .
barry coppinger , middlesbrough council 's executive member for community safety , said : " cctv is making middlesbrough safer and this added facility will make it more effective .
' community safety ' " for example , if an operative now sees someone dropping litter , they can tell them to pick it up , or if they see an incident starting to get out of hand , they can give advice that will hopefully nip it in the bud .
" i think that it will give people extra confidence as they go about their business and re-enforce the message that middlesbrough is a place that is constantly thinking about community safety . "
a similar " talking " system was piloted in wiltshire in 2003 .
mr coppinger added : " middlesbrough 's cctv network is one of the most comprehensive in the uk and in 2005 was responsible for helping net 678 offenders .
" it was also responsible for helping locate 15 missing people . "
the system is managed from a command centre in the town 's main bus station and linked to cleveland police headquarters .
it is hoped to install another three " talking " cameras in middlesbrough by april 2007 .
