europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .
globally , esa predicts that by 2020 , the market for satellite navigation systems will be worth 250 billion euros . marcel fürstenau -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .
it is to be completed by early 2007 at a cost of at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- . the bundestag had already voted in 2003 to build a more " aesthetic " cultural center on the site , behind replicas of the facade of the baroque hohenzollern castle , the former residence of the german emperors . but a lack of financing means that construction is unlikely to begin before 2012 . destroyi n g a part of east germa n history many eastern germans have fond memories of the palace , with its giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts , bowling allies , a wine bar , a theater , cafes and an international list of concert headliners including harry belafonte and carlos santana . some east germans nicknamed it ballast der republik -lrb- " ballast of the republic " -rrb- or erichs lampe n lade n -lrb- " erich 's lamp shop " , referring to east german leader erich honecker and the 1,001 lamps hanging in the foyer -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this art installation in 2004 flooded the palace , allowing visitors to paddle through after being gutted and stripped of 700 tons of asbestos after german reunification in 1990 , it won a new generation of fans in recent years as a venue for contemporary art installations and plays . in a poll published this week , 60 percent of eastern germans said they opposed tearing down the palace , as it would " destroy a part of the gdr 's history .

cdu foreign policy expert andreas schockenhoff , referring to the international community 's ongoing efforts to prevent countries such as iran from developing nuclear weapons , suggested that chirac was not being helpful . " we have to convince these countries that their situation is n't going to get any better if they possess nuclear weapons , " schockenhoff told reuters in berlin .
" i do n't think chirac 's approach is really the best way to lead this debate and to increase pressure on iran . " the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen , told spiegel online that chirac had acted rashly . " this is a unilateral declaration on the part of the french president , and it 's something he ought to have discussed with his european partners first , " weisskirchen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.01.2006 german politicians criticize chirac for nuclear comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's statements have raised a flurry of protest in berlin french president jacques chirac 's assertion that france would use nuclear weapons against any state that carried out a terrorist attack against it has met with criticism in germany . chirac 's threat of a nuclear response to any terrorist attack on his country prompted widespread criticism in diplomatic circles in berlin . the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- distanced themselves from chirac 's statements .
cdu foreign policy expert andreas schockenhoff , referring to the international community 's ongoing efforts to prevent countries such as iran from developing nuclear weapons , suggested that chirac was not being helpful . " we have to convince these countries that their situation is n't going to get any better if they possess nuclear weapons , " schockenhoff told reuters in berlin .
" i do n't think chirac 's approach is really the best way to lead this debate and to increase pressure on iran . " the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen , told spiegel online that chirac had acted rashly . " this is a unilateral declaration on the part of the french president , and it 's something he ought to have discussed with his european partners first , " weisskirchen said . " firm and appropriate response " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made the comments while visiting the l 'ile longue military base in france chirac on thursday raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches terrorist attacks against france . " leaders of any state that uses terrorist means against us , as well as any that may be envisaging - in one way or another - using weapons of mass destruction , must understand that they would be exposing themselves to a firm and appropriate response on our behalf , " he said . " that response could be conventional , it could also be of another nature , " chirac said in a clear reference to nuclear weapons during a visit to a french nuclear base in the northwestern region of brittany . opposition demands government action free democratic party chief guido westerwelle called on chancellor angela merkel to " encourage restraint " from chirac in comments to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
" i do n't think that anyone - and certainly not peace or de-escalation - is served when one trumpets to the world community employing nuclear weapons as an option , " said westerwelle , who leads the biggest opposition party in the bundestag . germany 's green party called on the german government to demand chirac to retract his threat .
the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , called chirac 's statements " risky " and " irresponsible . " " the federal government must insist that our french allies take back this statement , " nachtwei told the netzeitung .
there was no comment from the german government on chirac 's remarks on thursday . senior green party politician and former environment minister jürgen trittin said that chirac 's statement marked a " breathtaking turnaround " in french military strategy . " i 'm certain that this will not make the world a safer place , " trittin told spiegel online . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers split over iran nuclear program europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action .

but in stuttgart , a pair of bright young things have created a loft with a difference . more reminiscent of boxes than anything else , the " students ' lofts , " as they are officially called , are the brainchild of architecture graduates sven becker and michael sauter , and they offer an answer to the increasing problem of affordable accommodation in metropolises across germany and , indeed , the world . becker and sauter studied in the southern german city of stuttgart , where they were no strangers to the agonies of finding remotely affordable accommodation .
it was that experience , coupled with the need to come up with a convincing final-year project that led them to design and make the ultimate in compact and bijou living . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students ' lofts can be opened up to create more space the loft is essentially an eight-square-meter -lrb- 26-square-feet -rrb- box that can be opened up to generate a total of 20 square meter of living space , and can be rented on a short to medium-term basis without breaking the bank .
but that 's not the best of it .
" we saw that , while on the one hand there was a serious shortage of student accommodation , cities like stuttgart also have a lot of empty office space , which could be put to use , " michael sauter said . and they propose doing precisely that by installing their boxes inside large empty commercial spaces , thus creating small self-contained student communities .
each one would comprise between 10 and 15 individual boxes , and for every four units , there would be a communal kitchen area and bathroom .
" just like in a regular shared apartment , " said sauter , who proposes turning any left-over shared space into fitness zones and internet pools . big hit since going public with their boxes , which would retail at a cost of between 7,500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 - $ 12,000 -rrb- becker and sauter have been swamped with requests , and are discussing supplying them for soccer fans during the world cup , as youth hotels , artists ' studios or even student villages in turkey . " the beauty of this concept is the flexibility .
we will do the floors and paint the walls of the buildings into which the boxes are to be installed .
and then , if , after a certain period of time , the accommodation is no longer needed , the boxes can be moved out again and the space can be put to another use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside werner aisslinger 's loftcube that kind of adaptability is what makes such alternative living concepts so popular .
another german architect and designer , werner aisslinger , came up with the novel idea of creating spacious " loftcubes , " which could be installed pretty much anywhere , including on top of apartment buildings .
although less of a bargain than becker and sauter 's innovation , the cubes promise their inhabitants unrivalled views at prices that would n't buy so much as a corner of a basement in cities such as london , paris or new york . little luxuries meanwhile , back on the ground , munich-based architects john höpfner and lydia haack took on a commission from the city 's university to produce a series of " micro compact homes , " which principally differ from the stuttgart lofts in that they are designed for the great outdoors .
although they too , are viewed as a solution to student housing difficulties , they have a multitude of possible uses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rural setting for these futuristic , temporary homes " they can be used as guest apartments or for accommodation at large events ; we have had interest from hotels and from wellness centers in the countryside .
and of course they are interesting for students , because the universities can rent a piece of ground for a few years , erect the houses , and then once the lease has run out , move the accommodation on to somewhere else , " höpfner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick interior of the " micro compact homes " the " micro compact homes " are in a slightly different league to their indoor competitors , and carry a price tag of 35,000 euros a pop .
but you get what you pay for . this model of versatile , modular home comes equipped with a 120-centimeter -lrb- 47-inch -rrb- wide bed , its own kitchen area , toilet and shower , gas , electricity , telephone and internet connection . höpfner says the seven homes currently in use in munich have so far proved a big hit among their student inhabitants , who enjoy the design , the proximity to nature and the flexibility of the living area .
" the space is used in a clever way . things can be moved around , but they do n't have to be .
to use the bed , for example , you do n't have to put anything away or fold anything out . " he said .

it was that experience , coupled with the need to come up with a convincing final-year project that led them to design and make the ultimate in compact and bijou living . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students ' lofts can be opened up to create more space the loft is essentially an eight-square-meter -lrb- 26-square-feet -rrb- box that can be opened up to generate a total of 20 square meter of living space , and can be rented on a short to medium-term basis without breaking the bank .
but that 's not the best of it .
" we saw that , while on the one hand there was a serious shortage of student accommodation , cities like stuttgart also have a lot of empty office space , which could be put to use , " michael sauter said . and they propose doing precisely that by installing their boxes inside large empty commercial spaces , thus creating small self-contained student communities .
each one would comprise between 10 and 15 individual boxes , and for every four units , there would be a communal kitchen area and bathroom .
" just like in a regular shared apartment , " said sauter , who proposes turning any left-over shared space into fitness zones and internet pools . big hit since going public with their boxes , which would retail at a cost of between 7,500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 - $ 12,000 -rrb- becker and sauter have been swamped with requests , and are discussing supplying them for soccer fans during the world cup , as youth hotels , artists ' studios or even student villages in turkey . " the beauty of this concept is the flexibility .
we will do the floors and paint the walls of the buildings into which the boxes are to be installed .
and then , if , after a certain period of time , the accommodation is no longer needed , the boxes can be moved out again and the space can be put to another use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside werner aisslinger 's loftcube that kind of adaptability is what makes such alternative living concepts so popular .
another german architect and designer , werner aisslinger , came up with the novel idea of creating spacious " loftcubes , " which could be installed pretty much anywhere , including on top of apartment buildings .
although less of a bargain than becker and sauter 's innovation , the cubes promise their inhabitants unrivalled views at prices that would n't buy so much as a corner of a basement in cities such as london , paris or new york . little luxuries meanwhile , back on the ground , munich-based architects john höpfner and lydia haack took on a commission from the city 's university to produce a series of " micro compact homes , " which principally differ from the stuttgart lofts in that they are designed for the great outdoors .
although they too , are viewed as a solution to student housing difficulties , they have a multitude of possible uses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rural setting for these futuristic , temporary homes " they can be used as guest apartments or for accommodation at large events ; we have had interest from hotels and from wellness centers in the countryside .
and of course they are interesting for students , because the universities can rent a piece of ground for a few years , erect the houses , and then once the lease has run out , move the accommodation on to somewhere else , " höpfner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick interior of the " micro compact homes " the " micro compact homes " are in a slightly different league to their indoor competitors , and carry a price tag of 35,000 euros a pop .
but you get what you pay for . this model of versatile , modular home comes equipped with a 120-centimeter -lrb- 47-inch -rrb- wide bed , its own kitchen area , toilet and shower , gas , electricity , telephone and internet connection . höpfner says the seven homes currently in use in munich have so far proved a big hit among their student inhabitants , who enjoy the design , the proximity to nature and the flexibility of the living area .
" the space is used in a clever way . things can be moved around , but they do n't have to be .
to use the bed , for example , you do n't have to put anything away or fold anything out . " he said .
" the homes do n't feel claustrophobic , but are like quite tight suits .
they fit but they do n't pinch . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sisterhoods make a comeback in germany for centuries , beguine communities devoted themselves to a life of prayer and charitable work .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .
it is to be completed by early 2007 at a cost of at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- . the bundestag had already voted in 2003 to build a more " aesthetic " cultural center on the site , behind replicas of the facade of the baroque hohenzollern castle , the former residence of the german emperors . but a lack of financing means that construction is unlikely to begin before 2012 . destroyi n g a part of east germa n history many eastern germans have fond memories of the palace , with its giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts , bowling allies , a wine bar , a theater , cafes and an international list of concert headliners including harry belafonte and carlos santana . some east germans nicknamed it ballast der republik -lrb- " ballast of the republic " -rrb- or erichs lampe n lade n -lrb- " erich 's lamp shop " , referring to east german leader erich honecker and the 1,001 lamps hanging in the foyer -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this art installation in 2004 flooded the palace , allowing visitors to paddle through after being gutted and stripped of 700 tons of asbestos after german reunification in 1990 , it won a new generation of fans in recent years as a venue for contemporary art installations and plays . in a poll published this week , 60 percent of eastern germans said they opposed tearing down the palace , as it would " destroy a part of the gdr 's history . "
the survey taken by the magazine super illu interviewed 1,005 people in eastern germany . at the same time , a majority said they would prefer a permanent green space instead of the planned castle . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long good-bye to berlin 's palace of the republic berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.01.2006 esa signs galileo contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's goal is to outstrip gps in the navigation networks market the european space agency and galileo industries have formally signed a contract to develop the ambitious navigation system .
europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .
globally , esa predicts that by 2020 , the market for satellite navigation systems will be worth 250 billion euros . marcel fürstenau -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today , the stars have been replaced by satellites .

i see no alternative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.01.2006 esa signs galileo contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's goal is to outstrip gps in the navigation networks market the european space agency and galileo industries have formally signed a contract to develop the ambitious navigation system .
europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .
globally , esa predicts that by 2020 , the market for satellite navigation systems will be worth 250 billion euros . marcel fürstenau -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops .

he added that an inquiry could lead to " anti-americanism " and a rejection of the role of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any german guidance ?
steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops . " any investigation would lead to attempts to discredit the policy that made that possible , " steinmeier said .
he added that an inquiry could lead to " anti-americanism " and a rejection of the role of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any german guidance ?
steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth . " the bnd agents who were at the scene were in no way involved in either the preparation , the planning or the execution of the bombing of the restaurant in al mansour on april 7 , 2003 , " röttgen said . cracks have begun appearing in the opposition 's attempt to force an inquiry .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .
a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .
a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.01.2006 esa signs galileo contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's goal is to outstrip gps in the navigation networks market the european space agency and galileo industries have formally signed a contract to develop the ambitious navigation system .
europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .
globally , esa predicts that by 2020 , the market for satellite navigation systems will be worth 250 billion euros . marcel fürstenau -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today , the stars have been replaced by satellites .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .
globally , esa predicts that by 2020 , the market for satellite navigation systems will be worth 250 billion euros . marcel fürstenau -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today , the stars have been replaced by satellites .

but in stuttgart , a pair of bright young things have created a loft with a difference . more reminiscent of boxes than anything else , the " students ' lofts , " as they are officially called , are the brainchild of architecture graduates sven becker and michael sauter , and they offer an answer to the increasing problem of affordable accommodation in metropolises across germany and , indeed , the world . becker and sauter studied in the southern german city of stuttgart , where they were no strangers to the agonies of finding remotely affordable accommodation .
it was that experience , coupled with the need to come up with a convincing final-year project that led them to design and make the ultimate in compact and bijou living . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students ' lofts can be opened up to create more space the loft is essentially an eight-square-meter -lrb- 26-square-feet -rrb- box that can be opened up to generate a total of 20 square meter of living space , and can be rented on a short to medium-term basis without breaking the bank .
but that 's not the best of it .
" we saw that , while on the one hand there was a serious shortage of student accommodation , cities like stuttgart also have a lot of empty office space , which could be put to use , " michael sauter said . and they propose doing precisely that by installing their boxes inside large empty commercial spaces , thus creating small self-contained student communities .
each one would comprise between 10 and 15 individual boxes , and for every four units , there would be a communal kitchen area and bathroom .
" just like in a regular shared apartment , " said sauter , who proposes turning any left-over shared space into fitness zones and internet pools . big hit since going public with their boxes , which would retail at a cost of between 7,500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 - $ 12,000 -rrb- becker and sauter have been swamped with requests , and are discussing supplying them for soccer fans during the world cup , as youth hotels , artists ' studios or even student villages in turkey . " the beauty of this concept is the flexibility .
we will do the floors and paint the walls of the buildings into which the boxes are to be installed .
and then , if , after a certain period of time , the accommodation is no longer needed , the boxes can be moved out again and the space can be put to another use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside werner aisslinger 's loftcube that kind of adaptability is what makes such alternative living concepts so popular .

but in stuttgart , a pair of bright young things have created a loft with a difference . more reminiscent of boxes than anything else , the " students ' lofts , " as they are officially called , are the brainchild of architecture graduates sven becker and michael sauter , and they offer an answer to the increasing problem of affordable accommodation in metropolises across germany and , indeed , the world . becker and sauter studied in the southern german city of stuttgart , where they were no strangers to the agonies of finding remotely affordable accommodation .
it was that experience , coupled with the need to come up with a convincing final-year project that led them to design and make the ultimate in compact and bijou living . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students ' lofts can be opened up to create more space the loft is essentially an eight-square-meter -lrb- 26-square-feet -rrb- box that can be opened up to generate a total of 20 square meter of living space , and can be rented on a short to medium-term basis without breaking the bank .
but that 's not the best of it .
" we saw that , while on the one hand there was a serious shortage of student accommodation , cities like stuttgart also have a lot of empty office space , which could be put to use , " michael sauter said . and they propose doing precisely that by installing their boxes inside large empty commercial spaces , thus creating small self-contained student communities .
each one would comprise between 10 and 15 individual boxes , and for every four units , there would be a communal kitchen area and bathroom .
" just like in a regular shared apartment , " said sauter , who proposes turning any left-over shared space into fitness zones and internet pools . big hit since going public with their boxes , which would retail at a cost of between 7,500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 - $ 12,000 -rrb- becker and sauter have been swamped with requests , and are discussing supplying them for soccer fans during the world cup , as youth hotels , artists ' studios or even student villages in turkey . " the beauty of this concept is the flexibility .
we will do the floors and paint the walls of the buildings into which the boxes are to be installed .
and then , if , after a certain period of time , the accommodation is no longer needed , the boxes can be moved out again and the space can be put to another use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside werner aisslinger 's loftcube that kind of adaptability is what makes such alternative living concepts so popular .
another german architect and designer , werner aisslinger , came up with the novel idea of creating spacious " loftcubes , " which could be installed pretty much anywhere , including on top of apartment buildings .
although less of a bargain than becker and sauter 's innovation , the cubes promise their inhabitants unrivalled views at prices that would n't buy so much as a corner of a basement in cities such as london , paris or new york . little luxuries meanwhile , back on the ground , munich-based architects john höpfner and lydia haack took on a commission from the city 's university to produce a series of " micro compact homes , " which principally differ from the stuttgart lofts in that they are designed for the great outdoors .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops . " any investigation would lead to attempts to discredit the policy that made that possible , " steinmeier said .
he added that an inquiry could lead to " anti-americanism " and a rejection of the role of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any german guidance ?
steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth . " the bnd agents who were at the scene were in no way involved in either the preparation , the planning or the execution of the bombing of the restaurant in al mansour on april 7 , 2003 , " röttgen said . cracks have begun appearing in the opposition 's attempt to force an inquiry .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops . " any investigation would lead to attempts to discredit the policy that made that possible , " steinmeier said .
he added that an inquiry could lead to " anti-americanism " and a rejection of the role of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any german guidance ?
steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .

is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.01.2006 esa signs galileo contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's goal is to outstrip gps in the navigation networks market the european space agency and galileo industries have formally signed a contract to develop the ambitious navigation system .
europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .
globally , esa predicts that by 2020 , the market for satellite navigation systems will be worth 250 billion euros . marcel fürstenau -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today , the stars have been replaced by satellites .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .
it is to be completed by early 2007 at a cost of at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- . the bundestag had already voted in 2003 to build a more " aesthetic " cultural center on the site , behind replicas of the facade of the baroque hohenzollern castle , the former residence of the german emperors . but a lack of financing means that construction is unlikely to begin before 2012 . destroyi n g a part of east germa n history many eastern germans have fond memories of the palace , with its giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts , bowling allies , a wine bar , a theater , cafes and an international list of concert headliners including harry belafonte and carlos santana . some east germans nicknamed it ballast der republik -lrb- " ballast of the republic " -rrb- or erichs lampe n lade n -lrb- " erich 's lamp shop " , referring to east german leader erich honecker and the 1,001 lamps hanging in the foyer -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this art installation in 2004 flooded the palace , allowing visitors to paddle through after being gutted and stripped of 700 tons of asbestos after german reunification in 1990 , it won a new generation of fans in recent years as a venue for contemporary art installations and plays . in a poll published this week , 60 percent of eastern germans said they opposed tearing down the palace , as it would " destroy a part of the gdr 's history .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future .

cdu foreign policy expert andreas schockenhoff , referring to the international community 's ongoing efforts to prevent countries such as iran from developing nuclear weapons , suggested that chirac was not being helpful . " we have to convince these countries that their situation is n't going to get any better if they possess nuclear weapons , " schockenhoff told reuters in berlin .
" i do n't think chirac 's approach is really the best way to lead this debate and to increase pressure on iran . " the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen , told spiegel online that chirac had acted rashly . " this is a unilateral declaration on the part of the french president , and it 's something he ought to have discussed with his european partners first , " weisskirchen said . " firm and appropriate response " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made the comments while visiting the l 'ile longue military base in france chirac on thursday raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches terrorist attacks against france . " leaders of any state that uses terrorist means against us , as well as any that may be envisaging - in one way or another - using weapons of mass destruction , must understand that they would be exposing themselves to a firm and appropriate response on our behalf , " he said . " that response could be conventional , it could also be of another nature , " chirac said in a clear reference to nuclear weapons during a visit to a french nuclear base in the northwestern region of brittany . opposition demands government action free democratic party chief guido westerwelle called on chancellor angela merkel to " encourage restraint " from chirac in comments to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
" i do n't think that anyone - and certainly not peace or de-escalation - is served when one trumpets to the world community employing nuclear weapons as an option , " said westerwelle , who leads the biggest opposition party in the bundestag . germany 's green party called on the german government to demand chirac to retract his threat .
the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , called chirac 's statements " risky " and " irresponsible . " " the federal government must insist that our french allies take back this statement , " nachtwei told the netzeitung .
there was no comment from the german government on chirac 's remarks on thursday . senior green party politician and former environment minister jürgen trittin said that chirac 's statement marked a " breathtaking turnaround " in french military strategy . " i 'm certain that this will not make the world a safer place , " trittin told spiegel online . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers split over iran nuclear program europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action .

" the european union 's negotiation mandate has reached its limits and further diplomatic efforts should now be conducted from under one roof .
i see no alternative . " and although steinmeier conceded that cairo is skeptical about the step to the un , which could mean sanctions for iran , he said he was pleased to see that the arab world shared european concerns over nuclear weapons . " we all believe that the risk of nuclear armament in the middle east can not be borne and that we have to make every effort to ensure that it does not happen , " he said . hopes for n ew impetus i n peace process in talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak , steinmeier also discussed the instability in iraq and the situation in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2006 berlin 's palace of the republic faces wrecking ball großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny days are over for the palace of the republic germany 's lower house has approved the demolition of one of communist east germany 's ugliest , but best-loved buildings .
the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .
it is to be completed by early 2007 at a cost of at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- . the bundestag had already voted in 2003 to build a more " aesthetic " cultural center on the site , behind replicas of the facade of the baroque hohenzollern castle , the former residence of the german emperors . but a lack of financing means that construction is unlikely to begin before 2012 . destroyi n g a part of east germa n history many eastern germans have fond memories of the palace , with its giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts , bowling allies , a wine bar , a theater , cafes and an international list of concert headliners including harry belafonte and carlos santana . some east germans nicknamed it ballast der republik -lrb- " ballast of the republic " -rrb- or erichs lampe n lade n -lrb- " erich 's lamp shop " , referring to east german leader erich honecker and the 1,001 lamps hanging in the foyer -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this art installation in 2004 flooded the palace , allowing visitors to paddle through after being gutted and stripped of 700 tons of asbestos after german reunification in 1990 , it won a new generation of fans in recent years as a venue for contemporary art installations and plays . in a poll published this week , 60 percent of eastern germans said they opposed tearing down the palace , as it would " destroy a part of the gdr 's history . "
the survey taken by the magazine super illu interviewed 1,005 people in eastern germany . at the same time , a majority said they would prefer a permanent green space instead of the planned castle . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long good-bye to berlin 's palace of the republic berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .
a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .

but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .

it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .

a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops .

steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth . " the bnd agents who were at the scene were in no way involved in either the preparation , the planning or the execution of the bombing of the restaurant in al mansour on april 7 , 2003 , " röttgen said . cracks have begun appearing in the opposition 's attempt to force an inquiry .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .
a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .
it 's good that germany has declined paris ' offer of integrating its nuclear weapons into a european security structure . in the fight against terrorism , jacques chirac has once again caused a stir , but unfortunately not pulled an ace out of his sleeve . andreas noll -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians criticize chirac for nuclear comments french president jacques chirac 's assertion that france would use nuclear weapons against any state that carried out a terrorist attack against it has met with criticism in germany .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .
globally , esa predicts that by 2020 , the market for satellite navigation systems will be worth 250 billion euros . marcel fürstenau -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .

with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .

"
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops .

steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .

that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .

cdu foreign policy expert andreas schockenhoff , referring to the international community 's ongoing efforts to prevent countries such as iran from developing nuclear weapons , suggested that chirac was not being helpful . " we have to convince these countries that their situation is n't going to get any better if they possess nuclear weapons , " schockenhoff told reuters in berlin .
" i do n't think chirac 's approach is really the best way to lead this debate and to increase pressure on iran . " the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen , told spiegel online that chirac had acted rashly . " this is a unilateral declaration on the part of the french president , and it 's something he ought to have discussed with his european partners first , " weisskirchen said . " firm and appropriate response " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made the comments while visiting the l 'ile longue military base in france chirac on thursday raised the threat of a nuclear strike on any state that launches terrorist attacks against france . " leaders of any state that uses terrorist means against us , as well as any that may be envisaging - in one way or another - using weapons of mass destruction , must understand that they would be exposing themselves to a firm and appropriate response on our behalf , " he said . " that response could be conventional , it could also be of another nature , " chirac said in a clear reference to nuclear weapons during a visit to a french nuclear base in the northwestern region of brittany . opposition demands government action free democratic party chief guido westerwelle called on chancellor angela merkel to " encourage restraint " from chirac in comments to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
" i do n't think that anyone - and certainly not peace or de-escalation - is served when one trumpets to the world community employing nuclear weapons as an option , " said westerwelle , who leads the biggest opposition party in the bundestag . germany 's green party called on the german government to demand chirac to retract his threat .
the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , called chirac 's statements " risky " and " irresponsible . " " the federal government must insist that our french allies take back this statement , " nachtwei told the netzeitung .
there was no comment from the german government on chirac 's remarks on thursday . senior green party politician and former environment minister jürgen trittin said that chirac 's statement marked a " breathtaking turnaround " in french military strategy . " i 'm certain that this will not make the world a safer place , " trittin told spiegel online . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers split over iran nuclear program europe sought tuesday to keep up pressure on iran over its nuclear program , dismissing as vacuous a tehran offer to resume talks and seeking to overcome russian and chinese opposition to un action .

but in stuttgart , a pair of bright young things have created a loft with a difference . more reminiscent of boxes than anything else , the " students ' lofts , " as they are officially called , are the brainchild of architecture graduates sven becker and michael sauter , and they offer an answer to the increasing problem of affordable accommodation in metropolises across germany and , indeed , the world . becker and sauter studied in the southern german city of stuttgart , where they were no strangers to the agonies of finding remotely affordable accommodation .
it was that experience , coupled with the need to come up with a convincing final-year project that led them to design and make the ultimate in compact and bijou living . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students ' lofts can be opened up to create more space the loft is essentially an eight-square-meter -lrb- 26-square-feet -rrb- box that can be opened up to generate a total of 20 square meter of living space , and can be rented on a short to medium-term basis without breaking the bank .
but that 's not the best of it .
" we saw that , while on the one hand there was a serious shortage of student accommodation , cities like stuttgart also have a lot of empty office space , which could be put to use , " michael sauter said . and they propose doing precisely that by installing their boxes inside large empty commercial spaces , thus creating small self-contained student communities .
each one would comprise between 10 and 15 individual boxes , and for every four units , there would be a communal kitchen area and bathroom .
" just like in a regular shared apartment , " said sauter , who proposes turning any left-over shared space into fitness zones and internet pools . big hit since going public with their boxes , which would retail at a cost of between 7,500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 - $ 12,000 -rrb- becker and sauter have been swamped with requests , and are discussing supplying them for soccer fans during the world cup , as youth hotels , artists ' studios or even student villages in turkey . " the beauty of this concept is the flexibility .

" just like in a regular shared apartment , " said sauter , who proposes turning any left-over shared space into fitness zones and internet pools . big hit since going public with their boxes , which would retail at a cost of between 7,500 and 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 - $ 12,000 -rrb- becker and sauter have been swamped with requests , and are discussing supplying them for soccer fans during the world cup , as youth hotels , artists ' studios or even student villages in turkey . " the beauty of this concept is the flexibility .
we will do the floors and paint the walls of the buildings into which the boxes are to be installed .
and then , if , after a certain period of time , the accommodation is no longer needed , the boxes can be moved out again and the space can be put to another use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside werner aisslinger 's loftcube that kind of adaptability is what makes such alternative living concepts so popular .
another german architect and designer , werner aisslinger , came up with the novel idea of creating spacious " loftcubes , " which could be installed pretty much anywhere , including on top of apartment buildings .
although less of a bargain than becker and sauter 's innovation , the cubes promise their inhabitants unrivalled views at prices that would n't buy so much as a corner of a basement in cities such as london , paris or new york . little luxuries meanwhile , back on the ground , munich-based architects john höpfner and lydia haack took on a commission from the city 's university to produce a series of " micro compact homes , " which principally differ from the stuttgart lofts in that they are designed for the great outdoors .
although they too , are viewed as a solution to student housing difficulties , they have a multitude of possible uses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rural setting for these futuristic , temporary homes " they can be used as guest apartments or for accommodation at large events ; we have had interest from hotels and from wellness centers in the countryside .
and of course they are interesting for students , because the universities can rent a piece of ground for a few years , erect the houses , and then once the lease has run out , move the accommodation on to somewhere else , " höpfner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick interior of the " micro compact homes " the " micro compact homes " are in a slightly different league to their indoor competitors , and carry a price tag of 35,000 euros a pop .
but you get what you pay for . this model of versatile , modular home comes equipped with a 120-centimeter -lrb- 47-inch -rrb- wide bed , its own kitchen area , toilet and shower , gas , electricity , telephone and internet connection . höpfner says the seven homes currently in use in munich have so far proved a big hit among their student inhabitants , who enjoy the design , the proximity to nature and the flexibility of the living area .
" the space is used in a clever way . things can be moved around , but they do n't have to be .
to use the bed , for example , you do n't have to put anything away or fold anything out . " he said .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .
it is to be completed by early 2007 at a cost of at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- . the bundestag had already voted in 2003 to build a more " aesthetic " cultural center on the site , behind replicas of the facade of the baroque hohenzollern castle , the former residence of the german emperors . but a lack of financing means that construction is unlikely to begin before 2012 . destroyi n g a part of east germa n history many eastern germans have fond memories of the palace , with its giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts , bowling allies , a wine bar , a theater , cafes and an international list of concert headliners including harry belafonte and carlos santana . some east germans nicknamed it ballast der republik -lrb- " ballast of the republic " -rrb- or erichs lampe n lade n -lrb- " erich 's lamp shop " , referring to east german leader erich honecker and the 1,001 lamps hanging in the foyer -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this art installation in 2004 flooded the palace , allowing visitors to paddle through after being gutted and stripped of 700 tons of asbestos after german reunification in 1990 , it won a new generation of fans in recent years as a venue for contemporary art installations and plays . in a poll published this week , 60 percent of eastern germans said they opposed tearing down the palace , as it would " destroy a part of the gdr 's history .

esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .

for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .

it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .

but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .

a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops . " any investigation would lead to attempts to discredit the policy that made that possible , " steinmeier said .
he added that an inquiry could lead to " anti-americanism " and a rejection of the role of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any german guidance ?
steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth . " the bnd agents who were at the scene were in no way involved in either the preparation , the planning or the execution of the bombing of the restaurant in al mansour on april 7 , 2003 , " röttgen said . cracks have begun appearing in the opposition 's attempt to force an inquiry .
" we are prepared to get to the bottom of the matter , which is what the other opposition parties want too , " said volker beck , a lawmaker from the greens , who were junior partners in schröder 's government .
" but we are not interested in creating political hot air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german foreign minister , joschka fischer meanwhile joschka fischer , the greens politician who was foreign minister at the time of the war , said the government had been careful not to violate its own principles in deploying the two agents to baghdad . " to my knowledge , we never crossed the red line , the political-moral line , which we drew for ourselves , " fischer said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag likely to probe german role in us invasion of iraq germany 's opposition parties agreed tuesday that there should be an enquiry into the possible involvement of the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- in the iraq war .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops .

steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth .

the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .
a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .
it 's good that germany has declined paris ' offer of integrating its nuclear weapons into a european security structure . in the fight against terrorism , jacques chirac has once again caused a stir , but unfortunately not pulled an ace out of his sleeve . andreas noll -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians criticize chirac for nuclear comments french president jacques chirac 's assertion that france would use nuclear weapons against any state that carried out a terrorist attack against it has met with criticism in germany .

under fire over allegations that its spies in iraq secretly aided the us invasion that berlin vocally opposed , the german government has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for a parliamentary inquiry . speaking in parliament on friday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the two agents from the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- who were based in baghdad during the conflict had given " no support for the pursuit of war . "
he said they had done nothing to contravene the government 's opposition to the war . steinmeier described media allegations that berlin had shared military secrets with washington during the war as " scandal-mongering " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier has vehemently denied all the allegations the reports , which cited unnamed sources , allege that german agents passed on key information to us intelligence , including a report which led to an attack on a restaurant where then iraqi leader saddam hussein was believed to have been dining .
fourteen civilians were killed in the bombing of the site in the al mansour residential area of the iraqi capital , baghdad . parliamentary inquiry ? germany was an outspoken critic of the us-led war on iraq and steadfastly refused to contribute troops to the invasion .
steinmeier , who was chancellor schröder 's chief of staff at the time , appealed to opposition parties to drop their call for a parliamentary inquiry into the role of the agents , and reminded mps that not a single german soldier died in iraq as a result of the then government 's refusal to send troops . " any investigation would lead to attempts to discredit the policy that made that possible , " steinmeier said .
he added that an inquiry could lead to " anti-americanism " and a rejection of the role of nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any german guidance ?
steinmeier cut short a tour of the middle east in order to take part in the parliamentary debate and defend the agents ' role .
questioned in a closed-doors session of a parliamentary supervisory commission this week , the agents said they had played no role in selecting the targets for bombing , including the attack on the restaurant , and had no direct contact with us officials . the chairman of that commission , norbert röttgen , told parliament that he was satisfied that the agents were telling the truth . " the bnd agents who were at the scene were in no way involved in either the preparation , the planning or the execution of the bombing of the restaurant in al mansour on april 7 , 2003 , " röttgen said . cracks have begun appearing in the opposition 's attempt to force an inquiry .
" we are prepared to get to the bottom of the matter , which is what the other opposition parties want too , " said volker beck , a lawmaker from the greens , who were junior partners in schröder 's government .
" but we are not interested in creating political hot air . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german foreign minister , joschka fischer meanwhile joschka fischer , the greens politician who was foreign minister at the time of the war , said the government had been careful not to violate its own principles in deploying the two agents to baghdad .

europe hopes it will rival the reigning us gps network . europe marked a key step in the development of its galileo navigation project in berlin on thursday when representatives from the european space agency and the international consortium " galileo industries " signed a contract for the delivery of the first four satellites to be used in the system . " you are witnessing a very important event in germany , " said federal transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- shortly after the ceremonial signing of the contract .
esa 's managing director jean-jacques dordain , went a step further , calling the event " a great day for europe . " the participants in the galileo project certainly have great expectations .
by 2010 , galileo is supposed to be so advanced that it will be superior to the reigning gps navigational system , built by the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo 's 30 satellites will help to fulfil future transport requirements in order to reach this goal , 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- are being invested in research and development .
roughly two thirds of the money has come from national budgets , with the remaining funds coming from corporations .
with its 500,000-euro contribution , germany is the largest donor . in just two years ' time , the galileo system , including the necessary surface infrastructure , should be so technically advanced that the first four of a total 30 satellites can be blasted off into space . tests already successful since the end of december , a test satellite has been hovering 23,000 kilometers above the earth , and is now successfully transmitting signals .
that 's given the galileo project 's chief executive , günter stamerjohanns , further grounds for optimism . " the future of galileo industries is looking good , " stamerjohanns said .
" we will be the contractors for the other 26 satellites and the expansion of the infrastructure needed for the system to be fully operational , provided of course , that we as galileo industries in europe work hard and deliver on the project within the given time and cost frameworks . " as a purely civilian project , galileo should make europe independent from gps network , which is controlled by the us military .
if galileo is successful , it could also create as many as 100,000 new jobs .
while the german market stands to gain from galileo , tiefensee was careful to stress the project 's european dimension . " it 's not about creating competition within the european union , rather about what we have to do to beat our competitors outside europe , " tiefensee said . in the medium term , galileo is predicted to reward investors handsomely .
esa is hopeful that revenues could turn out to be five times as high as the initial investment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.01.2006 opinion : no ace out of chirac 's sleeve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does jacques chirac have up his sleeve ?
the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .
a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .
it 's good that germany has declined paris ' offer of integrating its nuclear weapons into a european security structure . in the fight against terrorism , jacques chirac has once again caused a stir , but unfortunately not pulled an ace out of his sleeve . andreas noll -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians criticize chirac for nuclear comments french president jacques chirac 's assertion that france would use nuclear weapons against any state that carried out a terrorist attack against it has met with criticism in germany .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .
it is to be completed by early 2007 at a cost of at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- . the bundestag had already voted in 2003 to build a more " aesthetic " cultural center on the site , behind replicas of the facade of the baroque hohenzollern castle , the former residence of the german emperors . but a lack of financing means that construction is unlikely to begin before 2012 . destroyi n g a part of east germa n history many eastern germans have fond memories of the palace , with its giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts , bowling allies , a wine bar , a theater , cafes and an international list of concert headliners including harry belafonte and carlos santana . some east germans nicknamed it ballast der republik -lrb- " ballast of the republic " -rrb- or erichs lampe n lade n -lrb- " erich 's lamp shop " , referring to east german leader erich honecker and the 1,001 lamps hanging in the foyer -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this art installation in 2004 flooded the palace , allowing visitors to paddle through after being gutted and stripped of 700 tons of asbestos after german reunification in 1990 , it won a new generation of fans in recent years as a venue for contemporary art installations and plays . in a poll published this week , 60 percent of eastern germans said they opposed tearing down the palace , as it would " destroy a part of the gdr 's history .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris . " " this palace has to go because its ruins are just too ugly and it defaces this beautiful city , " börnsen said . however , the president of the federal architects ' lobby , arno sighart , said the demolition would " create a gaping wound that is unlikely to be closed in the foreseeable future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .
it is to be completed by early 2007 at a cost of at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- . the bundestag had already voted in 2003 to build a more " aesthetic " cultural center on the site , behind replicas of the facade of the baroque hohenzollern castle , the former residence of the german emperors . but a lack of financing means that construction is unlikely to begin before 2012 . destroyi n g a part of east germa n history many eastern germans have fond memories of the palace , with its giant dance floor on hydraulic lifts , bowling allies , a wine bar , a theater , cafes and an international list of concert headliners including harry belafonte and carlos santana . some east germans nicknamed it ballast der republik -lrb- " ballast of the republic " -rrb- or erichs lampe n lade n -lrb- " erich 's lamp shop " , referring to east german leader erich honecker and the 1,001 lamps hanging in the foyer -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this art installation in 2004 flooded the palace , allowing visitors to paddle through after being gutted and stripped of 700 tons of asbestos after german reunification in 1990 , it won a new generation of fans in recent years as a venue for contemporary art installations and plays . in a poll published this week , 60 percent of eastern germans said they opposed tearing down the palace , as it would " destroy a part of the gdr 's history .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.01.2006 opinion : no ace out of chirac 's sleeve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does jacques chirac have up his sleeve ?
the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .
but jacques chirac has by no means played a trump card , says deutsche welle 's andreas noll . jacques chirac has a peculiar sense of symbolism shortly after the tenth anniversary of france breaking a nuclear testing moratorium in 1995 .
is he playing with nuclear fire ?
no , says the élysée palace and denies that the president 's speech was aimed at iran . yet the political daredevil chirac is aware of how explosive his timing is .
of course , his speech also contained a message to tehran .
we can also escalate matters , it says . all the same , his expanded nuclear strategy is not a legal provision solely aimed at iran .
the change in france 's strategy has been in preparation for at least five years - in its main features , even before sept .
11 and with the knowledge of the socialist prime minister at the time .
for this reason , the nation is not divided on this issue . whoever shoots first is dead seco n d the new strategy follows the logic that france 's nuclear program for has been losing value for years .
following the end of the cold war , there is simply an enemy missing , who could harm the territorial integrity of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac made his controversial speech aboard the " le vigilant " nuclear submarine nevertheless , there is always a highly-modern nuclear submarine on stand-by which could delete an aggressor from the map following an attack on france . the french allocate well over 10 percent of their defense budget , which is growing quickly , to pay for this nuclear luxury .
it 's a lot of money for a prestige weapon , as power politics offer little possibilities for the bomb . until now , france only had the nuclear option of complete destruction .
the basic rule - whoever shoots first is dead second - applied during the cold war .
but today , it is no longer of concern . e n suri n g e n ergy provisio n s today , though , paris wants to be able to threaten credibly again .
the new nuclear weapons are supposed to be able to strike dead-on , for example , destroying power centers of the opponent without contaminating entire areas . the delicate point about the whole matter is that these plans are astonishingly similar to the ideas of us president george w. bush about nuclear precision bombs and washington 's dossiers on preventative warfare .
this is incidentally the case with chirac 's announcement that a strategic provision of the country , which is not described in detail , had to be ensured with a vengeance . you do n't need a vivid imagination to think of oil or gas in this case . fra n ce is claimi n g the europea n leadership but chirac 's strategy of restricted nuclear attacks is not convincing because restricted nuclear warfare is unrealistic .
a threat with nuclear destruction is lost upon highly mobile operating terrorists , who are ready for anything , anyway . chirac 's second message is therefore : the middle-sized power france wants to self-confidently practice world politics and is claiming the leadership in europe .
a common european foreign and security policy becomes an even more distant prospect after this appearance .
it 's good that germany has declined paris ' offer of integrating its nuclear weapons into a european security structure . in the fight against terrorism , jacques chirac has once again caused a stir , but unfortunately not pulled an ace out of his sleeve . andreas noll -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians criticize chirac for nuclear comments french president jacques chirac 's assertion that france would use nuclear weapons against any state that carried out a terrorist attack against it has met with criticism in germany .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade . last-minute efforts by two opposition parties to save the palace of the republic have failed .
the bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority to tear down the building , which opened in 1976 to house both the east german parliament and an entertainment complex that was unparalleled behind the iron curtain . the vote followed a heated debate in the lower house .
gregor gysi , parliamentary group leader for the socialist left party , said the cdu / spd coalition government was dividing germans into winners and losers , instead of avowing itself to its past . " the demolition is wrong and irreparable , " gysi said , adding that tearing down the building was n't any better than the communist , who in 1950 blew up the imperial palace , which used to stand on the same site . a campaign by the left party and fellow opposition green party had stopped demolition crews , who started work on schedule in december .
but it was only a brief stay of execution . the palace defaces berli n " i see no truly persuasive reasons to overturn this decision , " said wolfgang thierse , a vice president of the bundestag .
the spd politician , who served as parliamentary president under the previous government , was himself a member of the opposition movement to the east german regime .
the palace was , after all , a platform for the east german government to rally , thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the demolition have begun conservative cdu politician wolfgang börnsen said the colossus was " architectural debris .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace is a sharp contrast to the adjoining berliner dom the destruction of the socialist realist monstrosity of steel girders and bronze mirrored windows is expected to begin in february .

a government spokesman said the move " could disturb bilateral relations " .
he was speaking two days after 43 people from indonesia 's eastern papua province , including several children , reached northern australia on a canoe .
papua has been home to an ongoing separatist struggle since indonesia took over in the 1960s .
indonesian foreign ministry spokesman yuri thamrin said on friday that australia risked attracting a wave of boat people from papua if it granted asylum to the 43 people .
mr thamrin also said that accepting their claims of abuses " could strengthen perceptions in indonesia that there are parties in and around -lrb- australia -rrb- who support or express sympathy for separatism " .
the papuans - who reportedly include leading pro-independence activists - arrived on australia 's northernmost cape york peninsula on wednesday .
the group was reported to be carrying a banner that accused indonesia of genocide in papua .
indonesia gained sovereignty over papua - a former dutch colony - in 1969 .

papua has been home to an ongoing separatist struggle since indonesia took over in the 1960s .
indonesian foreign ministry spokesman yuri thamrin said on friday that australia risked attracting a wave of boat people from papua if it granted asylum to the 43 people .
mr thamrin also said that accepting their claims of abuses " could strengthen perceptions in indonesia that there are parties in and around -lrb- australia -rrb- who support or express sympathy for separatism " .
the papuans - who reportedly include leading pro-independence activists - arrived on australia 's northernmost cape york peninsula on wednesday .
the group was reported to be carrying a banner that accused indonesia of genocide in papua .

mark hannaby the politics show wales click here to view politics show wales nuclear waste has a long shelf life a review of uk energy needs starting on monday 23 january 2006 , could herald a new generation of nuclear power stations .
that would prove highly controversial in wales , where the assembly government has set itself against further nuclear reactors - but does not have the power to block them .
an earlier energy review , in 2003 , backed energy conservation and renewable energy sources over nuclear options .
but the uk government argues that declining gas and oil supplies and the need to cut carbon emissions to cope with global warming mean the issue needs to be re-examined .
nuclear waste map where waste is produced and stored around the uk enlarge map welsh assembly government economic development minister andrew davies has concerns about the cost of nuclear stations , their security , and the difficulties of disposing of highly toxic nuclear waste .
mr davies said he had made his position clear to uk energy minister malcolm wicks , and would do so again in relation to the new department of trade and industry led review .
" we will make sure that our views are expressed and we hope they 're taken on board as well , " he said .
but the ultimate decision on whether to allow such power stations in wales will rest with westminster , not cardiff bay .
plaid cymru energy spokesman alun ffred jones am said : " though andrew davies has made noises about approaching government ministers and so on in london , the fact is that there are no signs that the london government is willing to allow the national assembly to take control in this area .
" that is a fundamental weakness and shows the lack of democratic control that we have here in wales . "
plaid cymru agree with labour in the assembly that increasing energy needs should n't be met by nuclear reactors , but the welsh conservatives remain open-minded on the issue .
conservative economic development spokesman alun cairns am said : " i am not necessarily pro-nuclear , but i am not necessarily opposed to it either .
" it is an important debate that we need to have .
" from the evidence that has been presented so far it seems that safety is not the issue any more , but it is about whether it 's cost effective or not . "
prime minister tony blair told the cbi last november that the new energy review would consider the development of a new generation of nuclear power stations .
welsh anti-nuclear alliance spokesman hugh richards said new generation nuclear reactors would prove environmentally damaging and would take too long to have the impact on climate change which some politicians hope for .
he said : " the setting up of a second energy review suggests that the prime minister did not get the answer he wanted with the first energy review and he will keep holding energy reviews until he gets the answer that he wants , which includes facilitating nuclear power . "

the south west regional development agency -lrb- swrda -rrb- spent £ 110,000 on a sculpture opposite seaton pool , freedom of information figures reveal .
but it has backed plymouth city council 's decision to close the pool , which is losing £ 160,000 a year .
swimmers say the cash spent on the public art would have been better spent supporting the swimming pool .
the city council 's cabinet agreed in november that it could not keep supporting the pool which it leased from the swrda until two years ago .
now the swrda , which is developing a business park on the site , wants the land back .
the city council says it can not afford to keep subsidising the pool barry wilkins , general secretary of the devonport royal swimming association , which uses the pool , told bbc news : " if you asked people in plymouth what they would prefer , a swimming pool or statues , i 'm sure they would say a swimming pool .
" it 's an insult to the people who use the pool . "
the swrda , which has spent more than £ 3m of public money on public art since it started in 1999 , said the cost was justified .
and the city council says a planned £ 25m " life centre " including an olympic-sized pool in the city , will offer an alternative for swimmers .
but campaigners say seaton , which is used by 100,000 swimmers a year , should stay open until the new pool is ready .

the south west regional development agency -lrb- swrda -rrb- spent £ 110,000 on a sculpture opposite seaton pool , freedom of information figures reveal .
but it has backed plymouth city council 's decision to close the pool , which is losing £ 160,000 a year .
swimmers say the cash spent on the public art would have been better spent supporting the swimming pool .
the city council 's cabinet agreed in november that it could not keep supporting the pool which it leased from the swrda until two years ago .
now the swrda , which is developing a business park on the site , wants the land back .
the city council says it can not afford to keep subsidising the pool barry wilkins , general secretary of the devonport royal swimming association , which uses the pool , told bbc news : " if you asked people in plymouth what they would prefer , a swimming pool or statues , i 'm sure they would say a swimming pool .
" it 's an insult to the people who use the pool . "
the swrda , which has spent more than £ 3m of public money on public art since it started in 1999 , said the cost was justified .
and the city council says a planned £ 25m " life centre " including an olympic-sized pool in the city , will offer an alternative for swimmers .
but campaigners say seaton , which is used by 100,000 swimmers a year , should stay open until the new pool is ready .

they claimed it is a proven technique for countering violent crime .
since the bombings of 7 july 2005 in london , the level of stop and search in connection to possible crime and terror suspects has increased .
since october 2005 the number of stop and searches has gone up by 30 % , according to the police .
human rights pressure group , statewatch says it affects people from ethnic minorities disproportionately - you are nearly seven times more likely if you are black to be stopped and searched , and twice as likely if you are asian , than a white person .
arun kundnani of the institute of race relations said : " a few years ago , we had the mcpherson report which came out after the murder of stephen lawrence and said the police need to look at how they do stop and search .
" but since the terrorism act , ethnic targeting is getting worse .
" all it does is alienate large numbers of people who have nothing to do with terrorism .
" it is a really destructive policy . "
stop and searches are not just carried out under the terrorism act , but also in the case where police feel someone is acting suspiciously .
the metropolitan police have powers to stop and search people under the police and criminal evidence act -lrb- pace -rrb- 1984 - but it requires officers to have " reasonable suspicion " that a criminal act is being committed .
the conservatives on the london assembly believe the level of stop and searches can be increased further by reforming the current rules , which require officers to spend seven minutes or more , on average , filling in forms .
if this were scrapped , they state , officers would be freed up to carry out more searches .
the metropolitan police has warned that any change to rules has to carry the consent of ethnic minority groups .
others question how efficient " stop and search " is for apprehending criminals .
on average out of 100 stop and searches of suspected criminals , only 11 arrests take place .
for terror suspects , the figure is much lower .
brian paddick , deputy assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police , said arrest numbers as far as terrorism was concerned were not a major consideration and that searches are carried out more as a form of deterrence .
but he said : " when it comes to the police and criminal evidence act where officers should have reasonable suspicion , then the arrest rate is something we are very concerned about . "
the police have power to stop and search people under section 44 of the terrorism act in certain designated areas without having to show they have " reasonable suspicion " that an offence is being committed .
these areas are re-authorised each month in london by the home secretary .
lawyer for rights group liberty alex gask argues : " usually there is a restriction on the police 's power to stop and search because they need to have a reasonable suspicion that somebody is carrying a stolen item or has a weapon , or something along those lines .
but with this particular power there 's absolutely no need for reasonable suspicion at all - so there 's nothing restricting the officers ' use . "
brian paddick denies that the police are targeting people because of the colour of their skin : " we 've seen a range from different backgrounds involved in terrorism and we 're saying to officers that you should not be targeting people just because of their ethnic appearance . "
the home office minister hazel blears has given government assurances that the powers would only be deployed when there is " a good reason to believe that there is genuinely a terrorist threat " .
also on politics show london zia trench reports on how " stop and search " is being used in london , and in the studio we discuss whether stop and search is serving londoners in the best way , and the police have found the right balance between safety and civil liberties .
and following the publication of schools performance tables and intense debate about the government 's education bill backing more choice for parents and greater independence for state schools , we discuss the latest results in london schools and whether the proposed reforms will help them to improve .

human rights pressure group , statewatch says it affects people from ethnic minorities disproportionately - you are nearly seven times more likely if you are black to be stopped and searched , and twice as likely if you are asian , than a white person .
arun kundnani of the institute of race relations said : " a few years ago , we had the mcpherson report which came out after the murder of stephen lawrence and said the police need to look at how they do stop and search .
" but since the terrorism act , ethnic targeting is getting worse .
" all it does is alienate large numbers of people who have nothing to do with terrorism .
" it is a really destructive policy . "
stop and searches are not just carried out under the terrorism act , but also in the case where police feel someone is acting suspiciously .
the metropolitan police have powers to stop and search people under the police and criminal evidence act -lrb- pace -rrb- 1984 - but it requires officers to have " reasonable suspicion " that a criminal act is being committed .
the conservatives on the london assembly believe the level of stop and searches can be increased further by reforming the current rules , which require officers to spend seven minutes or more , on average , filling in forms .
if this were scrapped , they state , officers would be freed up to carry out more searches .
the metropolitan police has warned that any change to rules has to carry the consent of ethnic minority groups .
others question how efficient " stop and search " is for apprehending criminals .
on average out of 100 stop and searches of suspected criminals , only 11 arrests take place .
for terror suspects , the figure is much lower .
brian paddick , deputy assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police , said arrest numbers as far as terrorism was concerned were not a major consideration and that searches are carried out more as a form of deterrence .
but he said : " when it comes to the police and criminal evidence act where officers should have reasonable suspicion , then the arrest rate is something we are very concerned about . "
the police have power to stop and search people under section 44 of the terrorism act in certain designated areas without having to show they have " reasonable suspicion " that an offence is being committed .
these areas are re-authorised each month in london by the home secretary .
lawyer for rights group liberty alex gask argues : " usually there is a restriction on the police 's power to stop and search because they need to have a reasonable suspicion that somebody is carrying a stolen item or has a weapon , or something along those lines .
but with this particular power there 's absolutely no need for reasonable suspicion at all - so there 's nothing restricting the officers ' use . "
brian paddick denies that the police are targeting people because of the colour of their skin : " we 've seen a range from different backgrounds involved in terrorism and we 're saying to officers that you should not be targeting people just because of their ethnic appearance . "
the home office minister hazel blears has given government assurances that the powers would only be deployed when there is " a good reason to believe that there is genuinely a terrorist threat " .
also on politics show london zia trench reports on how " stop and search " is being used in london , and in the studio we discuss whether stop and search is serving londoners in the best way , and the police have found the right balance between safety and civil liberties .
and following the publication of schools performance tables and intense debate about the government 's education bill backing more choice for parents and greater independence for state schools , we discuss the latest results in london schools and whether the proposed reforms will help them to improve .

the study of 2,782 people across the uk found no link between the risk of glioma - the most common type of brain tumour - and length of mobile use .
among cancer sufferers the tumours were more likely to be reported on the side of the head where they held the phone .
but the british medical journal study said people over-reported phone use on the side their cancer developed .
the research , which was carried out by the british arm of an international project called interphone , reiterates the findings of most earlier studies in saying that there is no connection between cancer and mobile phone use . "
these results are reassuring for everyone with a mobile " dr kat arney cancer research uk the team of researchers , involving scientists from leeds university , the institute of cancer research and the university of nottingham , spoke to 966 people diagnosed with glioma and 1,716 without the condition in five areas of the uk .
all 2,783 were interviewed about their history of mobile phone use over the previous 10 years .
they were asked to recall in detail how much they used their mobile phones , how often they used hands-free kits and what types of phones they had used .
' biased reporting ' research author professor patricia mckinney , professor of paediatric epidemiology at the leeds university , said : " for regular mobile phone users , there was no increased risk of developing a glioma associated with mobile phone use . "
she acknowledged that there appeared to be an increased risk among brain cancer sufferers on the side of the head where they held the phone .
mobile phone facts available in the uk since 1985 widely used since late 1990s now estimated to be owned by more than 40m britons , including many children most studies have found no raised risk of brain tumour but long-term effects still not known children still advised to use mobiles only when necessary the team , however , did not put this down to a causal link , because almost exactly the same decreased risk was seen on the other side of the head , leaving no overall increase risk of tumours for mobile phone users .

dr kat arney , science information officer at cancer research uk , said research such as this was vital for getting to the environmental causes of cancer .
" this is the biggest and most thorough study into mobile phones and glioma so far , and it adds to the growing evidence that there is no link .

the research , which was carried out by the british arm of an international project called interphone , reiterates the findings of most earlier studies in saying that there is no connection between cancer and mobile phone use .
these results are reassuring for everyone with a mobile dr kat arney cancer research uk the team of researchers , involving scientists from leeds university , the institute of cancer research and the university of nottingham , spoke to 966 people diagnosed with glioma and 1,716 without the condition in five areas of the uk .
all 2,783 were interviewed about their history of mobile phone use over the previous 10 years .
they were asked to recall in detail how much they used their mobile phones , how often they used hands-free kits and what types of phones they had used .
' biased reporting ' research author professor patricia mckinney , professor of paediatric epidemiology at the leeds university , said : " for regular mobile phone users , there was no increased risk of developing a glioma associated with mobile phone use . "
she acknowledged that there appeared to be an increased risk among brain cancer sufferers on the side of the head where they held the phone .
mobile phone facts available in the uk since 1985 widely used since late 1990s now estimated to be owned by more than 40m britons , including many children most studies have found no raised risk of brain tumour but long-term effects still not known children still advised to use mobiles only when necessary the team , however , did not put this down to a causal link , because almost exactly the same decreased risk was seen on the other side of the head , leaving no overall increase risk of tumours for mobile phone users .
instead , they blamed biased reporting from brain tumour sufferers who knew what side of the head their tumours were on .
another research team member , professor anthony swerdlow of the institute of cancer research , said : " it would be very misleading to the public to say that because there was a positive that this -lrb- mobile phones -rrb- causes brain tumours . "
he explained : " if we had found a raised risk overall and it was all coming from one side , i would believe there was a real case .
" but as there is a drop on the opposing side - the overall risk is not raised .
" that makes it rather unlikely that there is a raised risk . "
but he added that epidemiological studies could never show there was no risk of an activity , they could only suggest there was no raised risk .
' growing evidence ' the health protection agency said the research was good news , but that it did not give mobile phones a clean bill of health .
the board said it would not be changing its advice that children should not make unnecessary mobile phone calls .
dr kat arney , science information officer at cancer research uk , said research such as this was vital for getting to the environmental causes of cancer .
" this is the biggest and most thorough study into mobile phones and glioma so far , and it adds to the growing evidence that there is no link .
" although we still do n't know about the very long-term effects of phone use , these results are reassuring for everyone with a mobile . "
further research wendy fulcher , who founded ther brain tumour research campaign , said she hoped people would be finally reassured by the results of the research .
she added : " in relation to other cancers , brain tumours are the poor relation when it comes to research funding .
" there should be more money focused on the root causes of brain tumours . "
alasdair philips , director of campaign group powerwatch , says the study " does n't really prove anything " .
" i think they should have waited another couple of years and recruited more people with brain tumours so they could have interviewed them , because the trouble was they went back a few years and the people had died .
" if you get a grade four glioma you can die within a year or 18 months of it being diagnosed , and these people are just gone , so they could n't get their mobile phone history . "

"
the arctic today is no longer the menacing enigma that manifested itself in the minds of the people of the 19th century .
almost every square inch of frozen tundra , glacial ice , mountain and lake has been studied , photographed or travelled over .
if mary shelley needed a home for her monster today , she would need to look elsewhere .
nevertheless , so called " adventurers " are still driven by their egos and the need to " find themselves " to travel into this frigid and unforgiving environment .
but no longer are there bays , remote islands or glaciers to name after the wealthy patrons as was the custom of the early pioneers .
no longer do expeditions spend years enduring hardship and privation seeking new passages , trade routes or , worst still , disappear entirely without trace as happened to the tragic john franklin .
these days the arctic , and to a large extent the antarctic , has become a playground for the wealthy holidaymaker .
they play out a heroic charade which bears little or no resemblance to the real explorers of yesteryear .
one could be forgiven for thinking that when sir wally herbert became the first person to -lrb- undisputedly -rrb- set foot on the north pole in 1969 that would be the end of that particular quest - alas , no .
they still come in their droves - the first solo trip , the first woman , the first relay , the first wearing a red and blue parka , the first by pogo-stick .
it is all meaningless nonsense and is still viewed by the real heroes of the arctic , the inuit , with bemused and bewildered amusement .
so often travellers to the arctic rely on the arctic peoples to help , guide or share their expertise with them .
without the inuit sledge drivers , arctic pilots or native guides , the adventurers would be completely and utterly helpless and out of their depth in the harsh environment .
yet , when they return to their after dinner talks and ego-fanning book launches , the very people that allowed them their indulgence are hardly mentioned or even acknowledged .
after their few weeks in the arctic with their new five-season sleeping bags and their support planes , they return to central heating and comfortable homes , while the inuit hunter still stands at the top of a block of ice looking for his next meal .
' real people ' in my opinion , the british seem particularly churlish with regards to how they deal with the people of the arctic , even to the point , in one case , of not allowing a guide to appear in the expedition celebratory photographs .
i have travelled to the arctic more than 14 times and owe an enormous debt to the local people , or as the word inuit literally means , the " real people " .
i have had the great fortune to spend time with people who have befriended me , shared their houses with me , given me food , transported me via dog sledges across hundreds of miles of frozen ocean .
the anonymous pilots of twin otters and helicopters and those that just by their humour , strength of character and sheer ingenuity have allowed me to share their environment and return happy and unscathed .
my most recent journey to the arctic was to be a study of the effects of global warming , focusing specifically on the lifestyle of the inuit hunters of northwest greenland .
have your say " the arctic is the world 's early warning system and the red light is flashing " glenn morris send us your comments we were to travel in the footsteps of knud rasmussen , the great greenlandic explorer on an outward journey by dog-sledge in traditional style and return retracing a route across the ice-cap originally undertaken by the american explorer robert peary .
in the circumstances , events conspired to thwart our attempt and , ironically , because of global warming the ice broke up early and our plans changed .
climate concerns i spent many hours talking to the inuit hunters and the people of qaanaaq and siorapuluk who told me of the problems they were facing in terms of changing weather patterns .
the ice is melting sooner and freezing later , it 's thinner which makes hunting difficult ; the winds are more unpredictable .
the polar bears and other animals are changing their hunting and migratory patterns ; the type of snow falling is changing , which again is making hunting on the ice more difficult and dangerous .
i left the arctic having formulated the conclusion that their concern over their land and future is great , although an element of sad resignation exists .
the inuit voice is almost inaudible on the world stage and one can not help but wonder if anyone even knows they exist .
amid the media hype of the race for the us presidency in 2004 , i noticed a tiny newspaper report that said the world 's foremost scientists predicted the north polar ice would all but disappear in the next 50-70 years .
i noticed the evidence of that during my latest trip and the more observant travellers to the arctic have been highlighting this , too .
the arctic is the world 's early warning system and the red light is flashing - just how arrogant and complacent can we afford to be ?
it is the duty of the those explorers , holidaymakers or adventurers who have travelled to the arctic to look outside their own little worlds and give something back to the place that has given them so much .
we need to act , and act fast . "
glenn morris is a fellow of the royal geographical society and has travelled extensively in the arctic .
his most recent expedition , greenland by the polar sea , looked at the impact of climate change on the inuit people .

edinburgh city council confirmed that there was not enough money to build the sections from the airport to newbridge and from granton along the seafront .
however if phase one plans are approved , a route from edinburgh airport to leith , via princes street , could be up and running by 2010 .
environmentalists hit out at the delay saying trams can helped cut pollution .
funding gap edinburgh city council published formal plans for the first phase of the tram network on friday , with the full council debating the issue next thursday .
the council has set aside £ 45m out of its capital budget for the scheme , with the scottish executive expected to commit to providing £ 375m .
that figure should be indexed to inflation meaning £ 490m would be given .
however the £ 535m that would be available still falls significantly short of the estimated £ 715m needed to deliver the full two-line scheme .
the funding gap could only be plugged by delving into council tax revenue , something the council has said it would not do . "
the postponement of yet another of the tram routes is terrible news for all those hoping to see a safer , cleaner and congestion-free capital " duncan mclaren foe scotland andrew burns , the council 's executive member for transport , said the whole scheme was still subject to parliamentary approval .
speaking to bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , he added : " once the council and the executive funding is confirmed , we will be able to absolutely guarantee the construction of the section from edinburgh airport to leith waterfront via haymarket and princes street by 2010 .
" what we can not guarantee to be build immediately is the section from the airport to newbridge and the section from granton square out east to leith .
" the section along the roseburn corridor from haymarket north to granton square could be built under the sum of money mentioned as long as we keep costs under control . "
edinburgh 's liberal democrat councillors have welcomed the council administration 's decision , saying the only credible tram route for edinburgh is the one from the airport to leith .
' unnecessary link ' however , sustainable transport campaigners transform scotland said the council had ditched the wrong scheme .
chairman david spaven said : " they should instead have taken the decision to scrap the costly and unnecessary edinburgh airport rail link .
" we are now left with proposals for two new rail lines to edinburgh airport , and no new public transport for edinburgh waterfront . "
environmental campaigners said they were disappointed with the scheme 's delay and blamed the scottish executive rather than the council .
" the postponement of yet another of the tram routes is terrible news for all those hoping to see a safer , cleaner and congestion-free capital , " friends of the earth scotland 's chief executive , duncan mclaren , said .
" we are angry that , despite their increasing cost , the scottish executive can always find enough money to bulldoze through every destructive road building project it wants .
" yet , when sensible and sustainable transport alternatives are proposed , never enough money is forthcoming to deliver them . "
the scottish greens said that the tram route not arriving at granton would undermine the waterfront redevelopment scheme .
green msp mark ballard said " it is essential that any new development on the periphery of edinburgh has good public transport links .
" if the waterfront development goes ahead there will be 45,000 new residents in this area of edinburgh .
" we must have a fast and effective public transport system to avoid massive traffic congestion in the area . "

edinburgh city council confirmed that there was not enough money to build the sections from the airport to newbridge and from granton along the seafront .
however if phase one plans are approved , a route from edinburgh airport to leith , via princes street , could be up and running by 2010 .
environmentalists hit out at the delay saying trams can helped cut pollution .
funding gap edinburgh city council published formal plans for the first phase of the tram network on friday , with the full council debating the issue next thursday .
the council has set aside £ 45m out of its capital budget for the scheme , with the scottish executive expected to commit to providing £ 375m .
that figure should be indexed to inflation meaning £ 490m would be given .
however the £ 535m that would be available still falls significantly short of the estimated £ 715m needed to deliver the full two-line scheme .
the funding gap could only be plugged by delving into council tax revenue , something the council has said it would not do .
the postponement of yet another of the tram routes is terrible news for all those hoping to see a safer , cleaner and congestion-free capital duncan mclaren foe scotland andrew burns , the council 's executive member for transport , said the whole scheme was still subject to parliamentary approval .
speaking to bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , he added : " once the council and the executive funding is confirmed , we will be able to absolutely guarantee the construction of the section from edinburgh airport to leith waterfront via haymarket and princes street by 2010 .
" what we can not guarantee to be build immediately is the section from the airport to newbridge and the section from granton square out east to leith .
" the section along the roseburn corridor from haymarket north to granton square could be built under the sum of money mentioned as long as we keep costs under control . "
edinburgh 's liberal democrat councillors have welcomed the council administration 's decision , saying the only credible tram route for edinburgh is the one from the airport to leith .
' unnecessary link ' however , sustainable transport campaigners transform scotland said the council had ditched the wrong scheme .
chairman david spaven said : " they should instead have taken the decision to scrap the costly and unnecessary edinburgh airport rail link .
" we are now left with proposals for two new rail lines to edinburgh airport , and no new public transport for edinburgh waterfront . "
environmental campaigners said they were disappointed with the scheme 's delay and blamed the scottish executive rather than the council .
" the postponement of yet another of the tram routes is terrible news for all those hoping to see a safer , cleaner and congestion-free capital , " friends of the earth scotland 's chief executive , duncan mclaren , said .

practitioners in wales have more than trebled because of the increase in people suffering from back problems .
they says surgery waiting times in wales could be brought down by offering nhs therapy .
the assembly government says each health board must decide its own spending but alternative medicine has to be proven to be safe and effective .
still considered by some as something of an unproven alternative therapy - chiropractic treatment involves manipulating the joints , muscles and tendons , to offer pain relief .
in just five years , the number of registered chiropractors in wales has rocketed - from just 30 in 2001 , to 101 .
when you get this sort of pain all the time you 're quite prepared to go to any extent to make it better patient charles martin that is thanks in part to wales having its own training institute , based at the university of glamorgan .
dr david byfield , head of the welsh institute of chiropractic , said the government could help bring down surgery waiting times in wales by offering chiropractic therapy on the nhs - at the moment , patients have to pay .
" my feeling is it would drop waiting lists because people are getting access to care faster , and they 're getting some results and we 're using an effective form of intervention in order to provide the treatment people need instead of the waiting lists , " he said .
" we are an established profession that is available to the public in order to provide the skills and the care that they require , in order to assist the public in reducing some of this waiting list , and the disability and morbidity people suffer as a result . "
down in reception , there is also a growing queue of patients - charles martin has driven up from cardiff to try and find some form of relief for his sciatica .
" a friend of mine recommended this place because he suffered from sciatica last year and was treated here , and i suffer from the same problem , " he said. treatment involves manipulating the joints , muscles and tendons " i 've been to my gp twice , and had different medications , but they have n't worked .
i 'm looking for something .. because i ca n't move very far anymore .
" my friend was cured - if the word cured is right , at least there 's a chance .
" when you get this sort of pain all the time you 're quite prepared to go to any extent to make it better , " he said .
the assembly government says the use of alternative medicines is up to local health boards , who control local purse strings .
but with budgets already tight within the nhs , it is likely these patients will have to carry on filling a little bit of pain in their pockets .
oliver forbes-turner is a fourth year chiropractor student who opted for the career after calling on the services of one himself .
' amazed ' " i was working on a large country estate on northumberland , refurbishing outbuildings into cottages and it involved lots of heavy lifting , " he said .
" over many months and years of doing that i injured my back quite severely . "
i went to see a chiropractor in newcastle and with the use of no drugs and no surgery he was able to get me back working in three to six weeks , and i was amazed by that .
he added : " once people begin to understand the benefits of chiropractic and word of mouth begins spread and they realise how effective we are at restoring people 's function and healthy work capacity , there 'll be plenty of work out there for us , especially as more health professionals are becoming aware of the chiropractic industry as well .

thanet district council was discussing a government inspector 's recommendation following a public inquiry that the site should remain as a fun park .
but amendments were made which could allow for different leisure-related developments there in the future .
the save dreamland campaign were " not exactly hanging the bunting out " after the meeting , a spokeswoman said .
councillor john kirby , cabinet member for development services , said : " the intention is that it will remain an amusement park but with leisure facilities that will complement those in place now .
" if it can be proved that an amusement park will not be viable , then we have to look at other ways to get the best from this site .
" if we get a leisure developer coming forward who can guarantee its use 365 days a year , that 's what we 're looking for . "
