" carrying photographs and banners , they packed the spacious avenue in front of the federal parliament where his coffin lay on a raised , covered platform . party officials demanded a dignified farewell , then called for a minute 's silence for " our president . " " those who are attacking him are not even fit enough to tie his shoelaces , " said milorad vucelic , a senior official in the socialist party which arranged the send-off here after authorities refused a state funeral for the indicted war criminal . some in the crowd carried photographs of radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , the bosnian serb leaders wanted for war crimes by the same un court which was trying their mentor milosevic when he died of a heart attack a week ago . war crimes suspects in attendance several former yugoslav army generals were also present , including the war crimes suspect dragoljub ojdanic , a milosevic general who has been released by the tribunal pending trial . senior party officials spoke , some close to tears , as loyalists stood as a guard of honor beside the coffin in front of the parliament , famously stormed by pro-democracy protesters in the october 2000 uprising that toppled him . in pozarevac , milosevic 's home town 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- southeast of here , a newly-dug grave awaits him in the grounds of the family home , below a linden tree where he first kissed his future wife . tens of thousands expected at home town burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic is expected to enter serb legend despite his crimes party officials have said the 15:00 utc burial would be private , but they expect tens of thousands to flood to his birthplace .
several hundred were already watching the belgrade ceremony on a town centre screen . opponents of his regime , who have slammed what they call attempts over the past week at " glorification " of his 13-year autocratic rule , have organized a counter-rally in a central belgrade square to coincide with the burial . milosevic was standing trial at the un court in the hague on more than 60 charges over his leading role in the bloody 1990s balkans conflicts , including genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , when he was found dead last saturday in his prison cell . mihajlo markovic , a close milosevic ally , called him " one of the greatest sons of the serbian people . " " our slobodan has gone into history , " he added .
" rarely is such a man born , able to arouse such power in the people , to unite so many people . " " wanted " family members stay away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president 's passing is threatening to reopen old wounds party officials confirmed neither mira markovic nor the couple 's son marko were returning for the funeral .
they said " threats and blackmail " had prevented them flying in from russia , where they now live , and accused authorities in serbia of failing to provide guarantees she would not be arrested . milosevic 's daughter marija , who lives in montenegro , serbia 's federation partner , said she would not go either because of a family row over where her father should be buried .
she was to attend a church requiem instead . milosevic 's elder brother borislav , who lives in moscow , is recovering from a heart operation and can not attend . slobodan milosevic was toppled after his 13 years of bully-boy nationalism shattered the balkans , lost four wars , ruined the economy and isolated him and his nation from the international community . victims of slobo 's wars shed no tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slaughter at srebrenica is a drak stain on the region 's soul in srebrenica , the bosnian town where some 8,000 muslim men and boys were slaughtered by bosnian serb forces in europe 's worst massacre since world war ii , there was no sympathy for the death of a man many say escaped justice . " why would i care for him ?
all i can think of is finding my husband 's body and give him a proper burial , " zejneba cengic , who returned to srebrenica in 2002 , said . meanwhile anti-milosevic activists in serbia prepared for their own rally here later saturday . marjan milosavljevic , a 27-year-old student , said he had already bought 30 balloons , the emblem the protesters have chosen .
" some of the balloons are for my friends who have fled the country because of milosevic , " he said .
" but they were thrilled with this action and wanted to support it somehow .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .
that 's why i say we can do it , although against england and sweden , it will be very hard . qu xiao interviewed roque santa cruz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : paraguay paraguay are back again for a third world cup in succession , taking their total number of appearances to seven .

members agreed to meet again tuesday after getting reactions from their capitals . " the response we got from our colleagues today suggests that we are pretty close to where they wanted us to be , " britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry told reporters . " our wish remains that the council should act expeditiously on this text and send the clearest possible signal -lrb- to tehran -rrb- ... to reinforce the activities of the -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- agency , " he added . french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere also said he was " encouraged by the reaction " to the revised text , which he noted was " getting a lot of support . " " we are not very far now from the end of the discussion , " the french envoy said , adding that the co-sponsors were awaiting reactions from other members ' capitals to the text .
" i hope the reactions will be positive . " elements of the revised draft released friday said the un nuclear watchdog would report " to the security council as well as to the iaea board of governors , in -lrb- 14 -rrb- days on iranian compliance with the requirements set out by the iaea board . " halt to enrichment and commencement of inspections these include suspending immediately all uranium enrichment activities and resuming implementation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 's additional protocol that allows for wider inspections of a country 's nuclear facilities . but speaking before the meeting , chinese ambassador wang guangya said the 14-day deadline was too short .
" we must leave sufficient time for diplomacy and for the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- to work ... at least four weeks to six weeks , " he noted . the us ambassador to the un , john bolton , responded : " i do n't think there 's really been much support to go beyond a month , " adding , however , that there was some flexibility on the us side on this point . " the main intent here is to get the iranians to reconsider the mistake that they 've made these last 18 years , trying to pursue nuclear weapons , so the sooner we get that message out and the sooner we hear their response i think the better , " bolton added . us favors short time frame while china , russia urge patience russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , in an interview with the financial times on friday , also dismissed the 14-day period as " not very feasible . " lavrov said he saw " a parallel " between the current iranian crisis and the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 when the security council intervened before un inspectors had done their job .
" we would not like to see the situation where the value of the professional agencies would be underestimated ... at the expense of us getting to the bottom of the facts , " lavrov said . russia 's un envoy andrei denisov welcomed the franco-british draft 's reference to the need for iaea head mohamed elbaradei to send his report on iranian compliance to both the security council and the iaea board of governors . " this is movement in the right direction but we think it is not enough , " he said .
" we still think the iaea should play the leading role . " " it would be logical that elbaradei report be reviewed by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board first and then sent to the security council , " denisov said , stressing that the iaea was the proper place to assess technical aspects of the nuclear dossier . council members plus germany to meet monday tehran rejects western charges that it is trying to acquire nuclear weapons and insists it has a right as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty to conduct uranium enrichment . meanwhile wang said a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials of the security council 's five permanent members and germany in new york monday aimed to " consider the next step of activities by the iaea . " us under secretary of state for political affairs , nicholas burns , and his counterparts from china , france , russia and britain , which are permanent members of the security council and have veto-wielding power , plus germany , will attend the meeting , a state department official said thursday . germany is one of three european powers - along with france and britain - which have pursued three years of inconclusive negotiations to persuade tehran to renounce plans to seek nuclear weapons in exchange for economic incentives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea chief sees possible breakthrough in iran standoff mohamed elbaradei , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief , raised hopes of a breakthrough in the nuclear standoff with iran monday when he announced a deal that would let tehran pursue some atomic research .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .

and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .
that 's why i say we can do it , although against england and sweden , it will be very hard . qu xiao interviewed roque santa cruz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : paraguay paraguay are back again for a third world cup in succession , taking their total number of appearances to seven .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?

there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "
it 's very unrealistic to believe that when a national team plays somewhere , spectators do n't connect the politics of their home country and everything else that happens there with the players . pablo kummetz interviewed kuno hauck -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .

workers removed rubbish-bins and metal grills as a safety measure against possible vandalism . demonstrations this week ended in street fights and clouds of tear gas in paris 's latin quarter , in violence which the authorities blamed on outside trouble-makers from the extreme left and right . unions and student leaders predicted at least a million would take part in saturday 's nationwide protests , and urged prime minister dominique de villepin to heed the message from the country and withdraw his controversial measure . protestors demand government reverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests are growing in number and intensity " today we can clearly see that the mobilization is stronger than ever .
either the government listens to reason and withdraws the cpe , or it will be obliged to do so next week - because we will be back in the street , " said bruno julliard of the unef students ' union . an open-ended contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated within the first two years without explanation , the cpe is supposed to encourage employers to take on young staff by removing some of the financial risks involved . drawn up in the wake of last november 's riots in high-immigration city suburbs - where youth unemployment can be as high as 50 percent - the measure was approved by parliament last week as part of a wider equal opportunities law . but the opposition - which includes all the trade unions and a newly-invigorated socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- - says the cpe is a step back from hard-fought labor rights , and will make it more difficult than ever for young people to find long-term employment . half a million students on the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government faces a real crisis over the labor law two weeks of protests have been building steady in momentum , with strikes affecting some 60 out of the country 's 84 universities and nationwide demonstrations thursday drawing up to half a million university and high-school students . an opinion poll friday showed that 68 percent of the public oppose the youth jobs plan , up from 55 percent just over a week before . the campaign of opposition has developed into a serious political crisis for the 52-year-old prime minister , who has made implementation of the cpe a personal mission but has been criticized - from even within his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- - for failing to consult properly in advance . villepin has offered to add new " guarantees " to sweeten the pill and called for " dialogue " , but opponents say they will not enter talks unless the cpe is first suspended . french pm under pressure as crisis grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin is under the spotlight as the riots rage university chiefs who met villepin on friday night said that the prime minister appeared willing to make new concessions .
" he realizes we are on the edge of a clash , a real clash , " said yannick vallee , vice-president of the conference of university presidents . " we asked him if he was ready to make a gesture to unblock the situation .
he did n't tell us what gesture , but he seemed ready to listen and ready for a significant gesture , " he said . president jacques chirac has so far stood by the prime minister - backing the cpe and calling for negotiations - but commentators said he would be keeping careful watch on the scale of the protests . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de riots in france as job protests heat up police have detained nearly 300 people after students marches turned violent .

workers removed rubbish-bins and metal grills as a safety measure against possible vandalism . demonstrations this week ended in street fights and clouds of tear gas in paris 's latin quarter , in violence which the authorities blamed on outside trouble-makers from the extreme left and right . unions and student leaders predicted at least a million would take part in saturday 's nationwide protests , and urged prime minister dominique de villepin to heed the message from the country and withdraw his controversial measure . protestors demand government reverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests are growing in number and intensity " today we can clearly see that the mobilization is stronger than ever .
either the government listens to reason and withdraws the cpe , or it will be obliged to do so next week - because we will be back in the street , " said bruno julliard of the unef students ' union . an open-ended contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated within the first two years without explanation , the cpe is supposed to encourage employers to take on young staff by removing some of the financial risks involved . drawn up in the wake of last november 's riots in high-immigration city suburbs - where youth unemployment can be as high as 50 percent - the measure was approved by parliament last week as part of a wider equal opportunities law . but the opposition - which includes all the trade unions and a newly-invigorated socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- - says the cpe is a step back from hard-fought labor rights , and will make it more difficult than ever for young people to find long-term employment . half a million students on the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government faces a real crisis over the labor law two weeks of protests have been building steady in momentum , with strikes affecting some 60 out of the country 's 84 universities and nationwide demonstrations thursday drawing up to half a million university and high-school students . an opinion poll friday showed that 68 percent of the public oppose the youth jobs plan , up from 55 percent just over a week before . the campaign of opposition has developed into a serious political crisis for the 52-year-old prime minister , who has made implementation of the cpe a personal mission but has been criticized - from even within his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- - for failing to consult properly in advance . villepin has offered to add new " guarantees " to sweeten the pill and called for " dialogue " , but opponents say they will not enter talks unless the cpe is first suspended . french pm under pressure as crisis grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin is under the spotlight as the riots rage university chiefs who met villepin on friday night said that the prime minister appeared willing to make new concessions .
" he realizes we are on the edge of a clash , a real clash , " said yannick vallee , vice-president of the conference of university presidents . " we asked him if he was ready to make a gesture to unblock the situation .
he did n't tell us what gesture , but he seemed ready to listen and ready for a significant gesture , " he said . president jacques chirac has so far stood by the prime minister - backing the cpe and calling for negotiations - but commentators said he would be keeping careful watch on the scale of the protests . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de riots in france as job protests heat up police have detained nearly 300 people after students marches turned violent .

" carrying photographs and banners , they packed the spacious avenue in front of the federal parliament where his coffin lay on a raised , covered platform . party officials demanded a dignified farewell , then called for a minute 's silence for " our president . " " those who are attacking him are not even fit enough to tie his shoelaces , " said milorad vucelic , a senior official in the socialist party which arranged the send-off here after authorities refused a state funeral for the indicted war criminal . some in the crowd carried photographs of radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , the bosnian serb leaders wanted for war crimes by the same un court which was trying their mentor milosevic when he died of a heart attack a week ago . war crimes suspects in attendance several former yugoslav army generals were also present , including the war crimes suspect dragoljub ojdanic , a milosevic general who has been released by the tribunal pending trial . senior party officials spoke , some close to tears , as loyalists stood as a guard of honor beside the coffin in front of the parliament , famously stormed by pro-democracy protesters in the october 2000 uprising that toppled him . in pozarevac , milosevic 's home town 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- southeast of here , a newly-dug grave awaits him in the grounds of the family home , below a linden tree where he first kissed his future wife . tens of thousands expected at home town burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic is expected to enter serb legend despite his crimes party officials have said the 15:00 utc burial would be private , but they expect tens of thousands to flood to his birthplace .
several hundred were already watching the belgrade ceremony on a town centre screen . opponents of his regime , who have slammed what they call attempts over the past week at " glorification " of his 13-year autocratic rule , have organized a counter-rally in a central belgrade square to coincide with the burial . milosevic was standing trial at the un court in the hague on more than 60 charges over his leading role in the bloody 1990s balkans conflicts , including genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , when he was found dead last saturday in his prison cell . mihajlo markovic , a close milosevic ally , called him " one of the greatest sons of the serbian people . " " our slobodan has gone into history , " he added .
" rarely is such a man born , able to arouse such power in the people , to unite so many people . " " wanted " family members stay away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president 's passing is threatening to reopen old wounds party officials confirmed neither mira markovic nor the couple 's son marko were returning for the funeral .
they said " threats and blackmail " had prevented them flying in from russia , where they now live , and accused authorities in serbia of failing to provide guarantees she would not be arrested . milosevic 's daughter marija , who lives in montenegro , serbia 's federation partner , said she would not go either because of a family row over where her father should be buried .
she was to attend a church requiem instead . milosevic 's elder brother borislav , who lives in moscow , is recovering from a heart operation and can not attend . slobodan milosevic was toppled after his 13 years of bully-boy nationalism shattered the balkans , lost four wars , ruined the economy and isolated him and his nation from the international community . victims of slobo 's wars shed no tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slaughter at srebrenica is a drak stain on the region 's soul in srebrenica , the bosnian town where some 8,000 muslim men and boys were slaughtered by bosnian serb forces in europe 's worst massacre since world war ii , there was no sympathy for the death of a man many say escaped justice . " why would i care for him ?
all i can think of is finding my husband 's body and give him a proper burial , " zejneba cengic , who returned to srebrenica in 2002 , said . meanwhile anti-milosevic activists in serbia prepared for their own rally here later saturday . marjan milosavljevic , a 27-year-old student , said he had already bought 30 balloons , the emblem the protesters have chosen .
" some of the balloons are for my friends who have fled the country because of milosevic , " he said .
" but they were thrilled with this action and wanted to support it somehow .

members agreed to meet again tuesday after getting reactions from their capitals . " the response we got from our colleagues today suggests that we are pretty close to where they wanted us to be , " britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry told reporters . " our wish remains that the council should act expeditiously on this text and send the clearest possible signal -lrb- to tehran -rrb- ... to reinforce the activities of the -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- agency , " he added . french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere also said he was " encouraged by the reaction " to the revised text , which he noted was " getting a lot of support . " " we are not very far now from the end of the discussion , " the french envoy said , adding that the co-sponsors were awaiting reactions from other members ' capitals to the text .
" i hope the reactions will be positive . " elements of the revised draft released friday said the un nuclear watchdog would report " to the security council as well as to the iaea board of governors , in -lrb- 14 -rrb- days on iranian compliance with the requirements set out by the iaea board . " halt to enrichment and commencement of inspections these include suspending immediately all uranium enrichment activities and resuming implementation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 's additional protocol that allows for wider inspections of a country 's nuclear facilities . but speaking before the meeting , chinese ambassador wang guangya said the 14-day deadline was too short .
" we must leave sufficient time for diplomacy and for the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- to work ... at least four weeks to six weeks , " he noted . the us ambassador to the un , john bolton , responded : " i do n't think there 's really been much support to go beyond a month , " adding , however , that there was some flexibility on the us side on this point . " the main intent here is to get the iranians to reconsider the mistake that they 've made these last 18 years , trying to pursue nuclear weapons , so the sooner we get that message out and the sooner we hear their response i think the better , " bolton added . us favors short time frame while china , russia urge patience russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , in an interview with the financial times on friday , also dismissed the 14-day period as " not very feasible . " lavrov said he saw " a parallel " between the current iranian crisis and the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 when the security council intervened before un inspectors had done their job .
" we would not like to see the situation where the value of the professional agencies would be underestimated ... at the expense of us getting to the bottom of the facts , " lavrov said . russia 's un envoy andrei denisov welcomed the franco-british draft 's reference to the need for iaea head mohamed elbaradei to send his report on iranian compliance to both the security council and the iaea board of governors . " this is movement in the right direction but we think it is not enough , " he said .
" we still think the iaea should play the leading role . " " it would be logical that elbaradei report be reviewed by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board first and then sent to the security council , " denisov said , stressing that the iaea was the proper place to assess technical aspects of the nuclear dossier . council members plus germany to meet monday tehran rejects western charges that it is trying to acquire nuclear weapons and insists it has a right as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty to conduct uranium enrichment . meanwhile wang said a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials of the security council 's five permanent members and germany in new york monday aimed to " consider the next step of activities by the iaea . " us under secretary of state for political affairs , nicholas burns , and his counterparts from china , france , russia and britain , which are permanent members of the security council and have veto-wielding power , plus germany , will attend the meeting , a state department official said thursday . germany is one of three european powers - along with france and britain - which have pursued three years of inconclusive negotiations to persuade tehran to renounce plans to seek nuclear weapons in exchange for economic incentives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea chief sees possible breakthrough in iran standoff mohamed elbaradei , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief , raised hopes of a breakthrough in the nuclear standoff with iran monday when he announced a deal that would let tehran pursue some atomic research .

members agreed to meet again tuesday after getting reactions from their capitals . " the response we got from our colleagues today suggests that we are pretty close to where they wanted us to be , " britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry told reporters . " our wish remains that the council should act expeditiously on this text and send the clearest possible signal -lrb- to tehran -rrb- ... to reinforce the activities of the -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- agency , " he added . french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere also said he was " encouraged by the reaction " to the revised text , which he noted was " getting a lot of support . " " we are not very far now from the end of the discussion , " the french envoy said , adding that the co-sponsors were awaiting reactions from other members ' capitals to the text .
" i hope the reactions will be positive . " elements of the revised draft released friday said the un nuclear watchdog would report " to the security council as well as to the iaea board of governors , in -lrb- 14 -rrb- days on iranian compliance with the requirements set out by the iaea board . " halt to enrichment and commencement of inspections these include suspending immediately all uranium enrichment activities and resuming implementation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 's additional protocol that allows for wider inspections of a country 's nuclear facilities . but speaking before the meeting , chinese ambassador wang guangya said the 14-day deadline was too short .
" we must leave sufficient time for diplomacy and for the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- to work ... at least four weeks to six weeks , " he noted . the us ambassador to the un , john bolton , responded : " i do n't think there 's really been much support to go beyond a month , " adding , however , that there was some flexibility on the us side on this point . " the main intent here is to get the iranians to reconsider the mistake that they 've made these last 18 years , trying to pursue nuclear weapons , so the sooner we get that message out and the sooner we hear their response i think the better , " bolton added . us favors short time frame while china , russia urge patience russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , in an interview with the financial times on friday , also dismissed the 14-day period as " not very feasible . " lavrov said he saw " a parallel " between the current iranian crisis and the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 when the security council intervened before un inspectors had done their job .
" we would not like to see the situation where the value of the professional agencies would be underestimated ... at the expense of us getting to the bottom of the facts , " lavrov said . russia 's un envoy andrei denisov welcomed the franco-british draft 's reference to the need for iaea head mohamed elbaradei to send his report on iranian compliance to both the security council and the iaea board of governors . " this is movement in the right direction but we think it is not enough , " he said .
" we still think the iaea should play the leading role .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .

we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "
it 's very unrealistic to believe that when a national team plays somewhere , spectators do n't connect the politics of their home country and everything else that happens there with the players . pablo kummetz interviewed kuno hauck -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .

but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .

do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .

it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "
it 's very unrealistic to believe that when a national team plays somewhere , spectators do n't connect the politics of their home country and everything else that happens there with the players . pablo kummetz interviewed kuno hauck -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .

members agreed to meet again tuesday after getting reactions from their capitals . " the response we got from our colleagues today suggests that we are pretty close to where they wanted us to be , " britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry told reporters . " our wish remains that the council should act expeditiously on this text and send the clearest possible signal -lrb- to tehran -rrb- ... to reinforce the activities of the -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- agency , " he added . french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere also said he was " encouraged by the reaction " to the revised text , which he noted was " getting a lot of support . " " we are not very far now from the end of the discussion , " the french envoy said , adding that the co-sponsors were awaiting reactions from other members ' capitals to the text .
" i hope the reactions will be positive .

" we must leave sufficient time for diplomacy and for the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- to work ... at least four weeks to six weeks , " he noted . the us ambassador to the un , john bolton , responded : " i do n't think there 's really been much support to go beyond a month , " adding , however , that there was some flexibility on the us side on this point . " the main intent here is to get the iranians to reconsider the mistake that they 've made these last 18 years , trying to pursue nuclear weapons , so the sooner we get that message out and the sooner we hear their response i think the better , " bolton added . us favors short time frame while china , russia urge patience russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , in an interview with the financial times on friday , also dismissed the 14-day period as " not very feasible .

" this is movement in the right direction but we think it is not enough , " he said .
" we still think the iaea should play the leading role .

the euro 2004 runners-up will be hoping to put that right on european soil this summer . world cup qualifiers twelve games , nine wins : for the portuguese , world cup qualification was a clear matter .
no other european team shot more goals : 35 altogether .
in the end , the portuguese confidently qualified themselves as group leader , ending a whopping seven points ahead of second-placed slovakia . stars ricardo carvalho and fernando couto in defense , key players deco and luis figo in the midfield , as well as strikers cristiano ronaldo and nuno gomes are the top performers in the portuguese team .
and do n't forget forward pauleta .
his 11 goals not only put him at the top of the european scorers ' chart , he also beat the legendary eusebio 's record of 41 international goals for portugal . trainer the brazilian luiz felipe scolari led his country to the world cup title in south korea and japan .
he has been training the portuguese since 2002 .
the experienced coach was supposed to bring the team , which did n't get further than the preliminary round in 2002 , up to par .

" we have to try to support and promote the german players even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 4-1 loss to italy has german players , and fans , wondering what the world cup will bring germany were left with the perennial world cup host dilemma .
on the upside , they did n't need to struggle through a stressful qualification campaign , but were also left having to make a series of friendly matches - ones opponents often do n't take seriously - suffice as international preparation . german players are n't even getting much experience on the top european level , bierhoff pointed out .
while there are 43 italians , 33 frenchmen , 31 brazilians and 30 spaniards still playing in the champions league , arsenal 's german goalkeeper jens lehmann is the only german in the tournament . though there is n't much bierhoff and national team coach jürgen klinsmann can do to give their young defense a shot of high-pressure international experience before the world cup starts on june 9 , bierhoff said he hoped bundesliga coaches would be willing help keep their germany players in top-form . " it would be great if the clubs , as the season winds down and they realize their goals , give the german national team members as much playing time as possible , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe german fans will give the team the boost it needs fans act as a support group but as the german league remains close at the top , it could be up to german fans to prop up their team .
a task they became acquainted with during the 2005 confederations cup . " the crowd was unbelievable , they even supported us in our weaker phases , " current germany captain michael ballack recalled .
" with such great fans behind us we are all looking forward to this world cup . "

workers removed rubbish-bins and metal grills as a safety measure against possible vandalism . demonstrations this week ended in street fights and clouds of tear gas in paris 's latin quarter , in violence which the authorities blamed on outside trouble-makers from the extreme left and right . unions and student leaders predicted at least a million would take part in saturday 's nationwide protests , and urged prime minister dominique de villepin to heed the message from the country and withdraw his controversial measure . protestors demand government reverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests are growing in number and intensity " today we can clearly see that the mobilization is stronger than ever .
either the government listens to reason and withdraws the cpe , or it will be obliged to do so next week - because we will be back in the street , " said bruno julliard of the unef students ' union . an open-ended contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated within the first two years without explanation , the cpe is supposed to encourage employers to take on young staff by removing some of the financial risks involved . drawn up in the wake of last november 's riots in high-immigration city suburbs - where youth unemployment can be as high as 50 percent - the measure was approved by parliament last week as part of a wider equal opportunities law . but the opposition - which includes all the trade unions and a newly-invigorated socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- - says the cpe is a step back from hard-fought labor rights , and will make it more difficult than ever for young people to find long-term employment . half a million students on the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government faces a real crisis over the labor law two weeks of protests have been building steady in momentum , with strikes affecting some 60 out of the country 's 84 universities and nationwide demonstrations thursday drawing up to half a million university and high-school students . an opinion poll friday showed that 68 percent of the public oppose the youth jobs plan , up from 55 percent just over a week before . the campaign of opposition has developed into a serious political crisis for the 52-year-old prime minister , who has made implementation of the cpe a personal mission but has been criticized - from even within his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- - for failing to consult properly in advance . villepin has offered to add new " guarantees " to sweeten the pill and called for " dialogue " , but opponents say they will not enter talks unless the cpe is first suspended . french pm under pressure as crisis grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin is under the spotlight as the riots rage university chiefs who met villepin on friday night said that the prime minister appeared willing to make new concessions .
" he realizes we are on the edge of a clash , a real clash , " said yannick vallee , vice-president of the conference of university presidents . " we asked him if he was ready to make a gesture to unblock the situation .
he did n't tell us what gesture , but he seemed ready to listen and ready for a significant gesture , " he said . president jacques chirac has so far stood by the prime minister - backing the cpe and calling for negotiations - but commentators said he would be keeping careful watch on the scale of the protests . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de riots in france as job protests heat up police have detained nearly 300 people after students marches turned violent .

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .
it has two centers in berlin , and opened a branch in a rough neighborhood in hamburg earlier this year , with a branch planned for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child poverty exists in germany - and it is growing in the past years , poverty in germany has been on the rise .
a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ?

a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .

in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "

" carrying photographs and banners , they packed the spacious avenue in front of the federal parliament where his coffin lay on a raised , covered platform . party officials demanded a dignified farewell , then called for a minute 's silence for " our president . " " those who are attacking him are not even fit enough to tie his shoelaces , " said milorad vucelic , a senior official in the socialist party which arranged the send-off here after authorities refused a state funeral for the indicted war criminal . some in the crowd carried photographs of radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , the bosnian serb leaders wanted for war crimes by the same un court which was trying their mentor milosevic when he died of a heart attack a week ago . war crimes suspects in attendance several former yugoslav army generals were also present , including the war crimes suspect dragoljub ojdanic , a milosevic general who has been released by the tribunal pending trial . senior party officials spoke , some close to tears , as loyalists stood as a guard of honor beside the coffin in front of the parliament , famously stormed by pro-democracy protesters in the october 2000 uprising that toppled him . in pozarevac , milosevic 's home town 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- southeast of here , a newly-dug grave awaits him in the grounds of the family home , below a linden tree where he first kissed his future wife . tens of thousands expected at home town burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic is expected to enter serb legend despite his crimes party officials have said the 15:00 utc burial would be private , but they expect tens of thousands to flood to his birthplace .
several hundred were already watching the belgrade ceremony on a town centre screen . opponents of his regime , who have slammed what they call attempts over the past week at " glorification " of his 13-year autocratic rule , have organized a counter-rally in a central belgrade square to coincide with the burial . milosevic was standing trial at the un court in the hague on more than 60 charges over his leading role in the bloody 1990s balkans conflicts , including genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , when he was found dead last saturday in his prison cell . mihajlo markovic , a close milosevic ally , called him " one of the greatest sons of the serbian people . " " our slobodan has gone into history , " he added .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .

although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .

do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .

the dutch regularly produce teams of exceptional skill and attacking prowess but have yet to win the greatest prize . world cup qualifiers the netherlands failed to qualify for the world cup 2002 in south korea and japan .
so the team was all the more motivated to make it to the tournament in germany four years later .
and it dazzled its way through the qualifiers with not one defeat .
instead , 10 wins and two draws speak a clear language .
the " oranje " team could also win the top spot in group 1 , putting its strongest group rival , the czech republic , in its place .
in the end , it beat the czechs at home in prague outright with 2:0 . stars beginning from goalkeeper edwin van der sar up to the strikers , the positions in the dutch team are roughly equally strong .
in attack , arjen robben and goalscorer ruud van nistelrooy , who both play in the english league , certainly stick out .
the fact that even a top striker like bayern munich 's roy makaay does n't have a regular spot on this international team speaks volumes . trainer with marco van basten , a former striker superstar is coaching the dutch team .
van basten enjoys the respect of his charges already through his successful time as a player .
he was european champion with the dutch team in 1988 and one of the most dangerous forwards in europe .
he succeeded dick advocaat as trainer , who stepped down following sharp criticism of his work after the european cup in 2004 .
van basten can send a homogenous team onto the field .
alongside old hands , he has carefully integrated several young players like arjen robben , wesley sneijder , or rafael van der vaart into the team . world cup history the netherlands is participating in the world cup for the eighth time . 1934 : round of 16 , 1938 : round of 16 , 1974 : runner-up , 1978 : runner-up , 1990 : round of 16 , 1994 : quarter-finals , 1998 : fourth place match schedule : preliminary round june 11 , 2006 : serbia and montenegro - netherlands in leipzig june 16 , 2006 : netherlands - côte d 'ivoire in stuttgart june 21 , 2006 : netherlands - argentina in frankfurt world cup base the dutch have been drawn to baden-württemberg for the world cup .
the team will be residing in the parkhotel adler in hinterzarten . outlook the " oranje " team has to date always reached the round of 16 at least .
this is certainly not too much to expect at the world cup in germany , too .
but the dutch want more , namely the world cup title .

members agreed to meet again tuesday after getting reactions from their capitals .

" our wish remains that the council should act expeditiously on this text and send the clearest possible signal -lrb- to tehran -rrb- ... to reinforce the activities of the -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- agency , " he added . french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere also said he was " encouraged by the reaction " to the revised text , which he noted was " getting a lot of support .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .
that 's why i say we can do it , although against england and sweden , it will be very hard . qu xiao interviewed roque santa cruz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : paraguay paraguay are back again for a third world cup in succession , taking their total number of appearances to seven .
they will be hoping to get good results against group favorites england and sweden in their bid to progress .
tracking down soccer 's superstars germany will be flooded with soccer stars this summer , but as world cup tickets start selling out , lurking outside the hotel could be the best way to catch the game 's biggest names .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "
it 's very unrealistic to believe that when a national team plays somewhere , spectators do n't connect the politics of their home country and everything else that happens there with the players . pablo kummetz interviewed kuno hauck -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .

should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .

" we have to try to support and promote the german players even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 4-1 loss to italy has german players , and fans , wondering what the world cup will bring germany were left with the perennial world cup host dilemma .
on the upside , they did n't need to struggle through a stressful qualification campaign , but were also left having to make a series of friendly matches - ones opponents often do n't take seriously - suffice as international preparation . german players are n't even getting much experience on the top european level , bierhoff pointed out .
while there are 43 italians , 33 frenchmen , 31 brazilians and 30 spaniards still playing in the champions league , arsenal 's german goalkeeper jens lehmann is the only german in the tournament . though there is n't much bierhoff and national team coach jürgen klinsmann can do to give their young defense a shot of high-pressure international experience before the world cup starts on june 9 , bierhoff said he hoped bundesliga coaches would be willing help keep their germany players in top-form . " it would be great if the clubs , as the season winds down and they realize their goals , give the german national team members as much playing time as possible , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe german fans will give the team the boost it needs fans act as a support group but as the german league remains close at the top , it could be up to german fans to prop up their team .
a task they became acquainted with during the 2005 confederations cup . " the crowd was unbelievable , they even supported us in our weaker phases , " current germany captain michael ballack recalled .
" with such great fans behind us we are all looking forward to this world cup . "
according to fifa regulations , fans will find out exactly who they will be cheering for by may 15 , making wednesday 's match against the united states klinsmann 's last chance to test potential world cup team members . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " klinsmann has put together a good team " giovane elber was the bundesliga 's most successful player with stints at bayern and mönchengladbach .

angola 's success in their sixth world cup campaign can be put down to their home-pitch potency - they won all their games at " la cidadela " stadium . stars team captain fabrice akwa is the angolan man to watch .
the former benfica lissabon player , who is now plying his trade in qatar , was a near-guarantee for angola 's success in the qualification matches .
when the pressure was on , akwa scored his team 's deciding goals . trainer the angolans are n't shy when it comes to honoring their national team coach luis oliveira goncalves , with some fervent fans calling for him to receive a contract for life .
even after failing to reach the african cup of nations quarter-finals , goncalves still enjoys much popular support in the southwest african country . world cup history the angolans are making their first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 11 : angola - portugal in cologne june 16 : mexico - angola in hanover june 21 : iran - angola in leipzig world cup base the angolan team will be staying in lower saxony 's celle during the world cup . outlook as world cup rookies , getting out of the group round is the most angola can realistically hope for - and that alone would be a feat worth celebrating in the capital luanda .

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .
it has two centers in berlin , and opened a branch in a rough neighborhood in hamburg earlier this year , with a branch planned for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child poverty exists in germany - and it is growing in the past years , poverty in germany has been on the rise .
a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .
" we always prick up our ears when we hear something that implies that you ca n't be healthy without food supplements , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is real food sufficient to provide vitamins ?
in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "
and besides , he argued , vitamins are n't anything bad for you , like cigarettes or alcohol . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business poised to fill growing social gap german firms have a long history of social involvement .

but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .

members agreed to meet again tuesday after getting reactions from their capitals . " the response we got from our colleagues today suggests that we are pretty close to where they wanted us to be , " britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry told reporters . " our wish remains that the council should act expeditiously on this text and send the clearest possible signal -lrb- to tehran -rrb- ... to reinforce the activities of the -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- agency , " he added . french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere also said he was " encouraged by the reaction " to the revised text , which he noted was " getting a lot of support . " " we are not very far now from the end of the discussion , " the french envoy said , adding that the co-sponsors were awaiting reactions from other members ' capitals to the text .
" i hope the reactions will be positive . " elements of the revised draft released friday said the un nuclear watchdog would report " to the security council as well as to the iaea board of governors , in -lrb- 14 -rrb- days on iranian compliance with the requirements set out by the iaea board . " halt to enrichment and commencement of inspections these include suspending immediately all uranium enrichment activities and resuming implementation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 's additional protocol that allows for wider inspections of a country 's nuclear facilities . but speaking before the meeting , chinese ambassador wang guangya said the 14-day deadline was too short .
" we must leave sufficient time for diplomacy and for the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- to work ... at least four weeks to six weeks , " he noted . the us ambassador to the un , john bolton , responded : " i do n't think there 's really been much support to go beyond a month , " adding , however , that there was some flexibility on the us side on this point . " the main intent here is to get the iranians to reconsider the mistake that they 've made these last 18 years , trying to pursue nuclear weapons , so the sooner we get that message out and the sooner we hear their response i think the better , " bolton added . us favors short time frame while china , russia urge patience russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , in an interview with the financial times on friday , also dismissed the 14-day period as " not very feasible . " lavrov said he saw " a parallel " between the current iranian crisis and the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 when the security council intervened before un inspectors had done their job .
" we would not like to see the situation where the value of the professional agencies would be underestimated ... at the expense of us getting to the bottom of the facts , " lavrov said . russia 's un envoy andrei denisov welcomed the franco-british draft 's reference to the need for iaea head mohamed elbaradei to send his report on iranian compliance to both the security council and the iaea board of governors . " this is movement in the right direction but we think it is not enough , " he said .
" we still think the iaea should play the leading role . " " it would be logical that elbaradei report be reviewed by the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board first and then sent to the security council , " denisov said , stressing that the iaea was the proper place to assess technical aspects of the nuclear dossier . council members plus germany to meet monday tehran rejects western charges that it is trying to acquire nuclear weapons and insists it has a right as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty to conduct uranium enrichment . meanwhile wang said a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials of the security council 's five permanent members and germany in new york monday aimed to " consider the next step of activities by the iaea . " us under secretary of state for political affairs , nicholas burns , and his counterparts from china , france , russia and britain , which are permanent members of the security council and have veto-wielding power , plus germany , will attend the meeting , a state department official said thursday . germany is one of three european powers - along with france and britain - which have pursued three years of inconclusive negotiations to persuade tehran to renounce plans to seek nuclear weapons in exchange for economic incentives . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea chief sees possible breakthrough in iran standoff mohamed elbaradei , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief , raised hopes of a breakthrough in the nuclear standoff with iran monday when he announced a deal that would let tehran pursue some atomic research .

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .
it has two centers in berlin , and opened a branch in a rough neighborhood in hamburg earlier this year , with a branch planned for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child poverty exists in germany - and it is growing in the past years , poverty in germany has been on the rise .
a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .
" we always prick up our ears when we hear something that implies that you ca n't be healthy without food supplements , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is real food sufficient to provide vitamins ?
in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "
and besides , he argued , vitamins are n't anything bad for you , like cigarettes or alcohol . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business poised to fill growing social gap german firms have a long history of social involvement .

" we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .

should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .

we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .
it has two centers in berlin , and opened a branch in a rough neighborhood in hamburg earlier this year , with a branch planned for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child poverty exists in germany - and it is growing in the past years , poverty in germany has been on the rise .
a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .
" we always prick up our ears when we hear something that implies that you ca n't be healthy without food supplements , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is real food sufficient to provide vitamins ?
in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "
and besides , he argued , vitamins are n't anything bad for you , like cigarettes or alcohol . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business poised to fill growing social gap german firms have a long history of social involvement .

angola 's success in their sixth world cup campaign can be put down to their home-pitch potency - they won all their games at " la cidadela " stadium . stars team captain fabrice akwa is the angolan man to watch .
the former benfica lissabon player , who is now plying his trade in qatar , was a near-guarantee for angola 's success in the qualification matches .
when the pressure was on , akwa scored his team 's deciding goals . trainer the angolans are n't shy when it comes to honoring their national team coach luis oliveira goncalves , with some fervent fans calling for him to receive a contract for life .
even after failing to reach the african cup of nations quarter-finals , goncalves still enjoys much popular support in the southwest african country . world cup history the angolans are making their first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 11 : angola - portugal in cologne june 16 : mexico - angola in hanover june 21 : iran - angola in leipzig world cup base the angolan team will be staying in lower saxony 's celle during the world cup . outlook as world cup rookies , getting out of the group round is the most angola can realistically hope for - and that alone would be a feat worth celebrating in the capital luanda .

angola 's success in their sixth world cup campaign can be put down to their home-pitch potency - they won all their games at " la cidadela " stadium . stars team captain fabrice akwa is the angolan man to watch .
the former benfica lissabon player , who is now plying his trade in qatar , was a near-guarantee for angola 's success in the qualification matches .
when the pressure was on , akwa scored his team 's deciding goals . trainer the angolans are n't shy when it comes to honoring their national team coach luis oliveira goncalves , with some fervent fans calling for him to receive a contract for life .
even after failing to reach the african cup of nations quarter-finals , goncalves still enjoys much popular support in the southwest african country . world cup history the angolans are making their first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 11 : angola - portugal in cologne june 16 : mexico - angola in hanover june 21 : iran - angola in leipzig world cup base the angolan team will be staying in lower saxony 's celle during the world cup . outlook as world cup rookies , getting out of the group round is the most angola can realistically hope for - and that alone would be a feat worth celebrating in the capital luanda .
games against mexico and portugal put goncalves ' team against two top-notch sides , and the final match against iran , another team with nothing to lose , should also prove difficult . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links federacao angolana de futebol -lrb- f.a.f. -rrb-

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .

a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .

in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .

a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .

germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .
" we always prick up our ears when we hear something that implies that you ca n't be healthy without food supplements , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is real food sufficient to provide vitamins ?
in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "

angola 's success in their sixth world cup campaign can be put down to their home-pitch potency - they won all their games at " la cidadela " stadium . stars team captain fabrice akwa is the angolan man to watch .
the former benfica lissabon player , who is now plying his trade in qatar , was a near-guarantee for angola 's success in the qualification matches .
when the pressure was on , akwa scored his team 's deciding goals . trainer the angolans are n't shy when it comes to honoring their national team coach luis oliveira goncalves , with some fervent fans calling for him to receive a contract for life .
even after failing to reach the african cup of nations quarter-finals , goncalves still enjoys much popular support in the southwest african country . world cup history the angolans are making their first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 11 : angola - portugal in cologne june 16 : mexico - angola in hanover june 21 : iran - angola in leipzig world cup base the angolan team will be staying in lower saxony 's celle during the world cup . outlook as world cup rookies , getting out of the group round is the most angola can realistically hope for - and that alone would be a feat worth celebrating in the capital luanda .

angola 's success in their sixth world cup campaign can be put down to their home-pitch potency - they won all their games at " la cidadela " stadium . stars team captain fabrice akwa is the angolan man to watch .
the former benfica lissabon player , who is now plying his trade in qatar , was a near-guarantee for angola 's success in the qualification matches .
when the pressure was on , akwa scored his team 's deciding goals . trainer the angolans are n't shy when it comes to honoring their national team coach luis oliveira goncalves , with some fervent fans calling for him to receive a contract for life .
even after failing to reach the african cup of nations quarter-finals , goncalves still enjoys much popular support in the southwest african country . world cup history the angolans are making their first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 11 : angola - portugal in cologne june 16 : mexico - angola in hanover june 21 : iran - angola in leipzig world cup base the angolan team will be staying in lower saxony 's celle during the world cup . outlook as world cup rookies , getting out of the group round is the most angola can realistically hope for - and that alone would be a feat worth celebrating in the capital luanda .

the dutch regularly produce teams of exceptional skill and attacking prowess but have yet to win the greatest prize . world cup qualifiers the netherlands failed to qualify for the world cup 2002 in south korea and japan .
so the team was all the more motivated to make it to the tournament in germany four years later .
and it dazzled its way through the qualifiers with not one defeat .
instead , 10 wins and two draws speak a clear language .
the " oranje " team could also win the top spot in group 1 , putting its strongest group rival , the czech republic , in its place .
in the end , it beat the czechs at home in prague outright with 2:0 . stars beginning from goalkeeper edwin van der sar up to the strikers , the positions in the dutch team are roughly equally strong .
in attack , arjen robben and goalscorer ruud van nistelrooy , who both play in the english league , certainly stick out .
the fact that even a top striker like bayern munich 's roy makaay does n't have a regular spot on this international team speaks volumes . trainer with marco van basten , a former striker superstar is coaching the dutch team .
van basten enjoys the respect of his charges already through his successful time as a player .
he was european champion with the dutch team in 1988 and one of the most dangerous forwards in europe .
he succeeded dick advocaat as trainer , who stepped down following sharp criticism of his work after the european cup in 2004 .
van basten can send a homogenous team onto the field .
alongside old hands , he has carefully integrated several young players like arjen robben , wesley sneijder , or rafael van der vaart into the team . world cup history the netherlands is participating in the world cup for the eighth time . 1934 : round of 16 , 1938 : round of 16 , 1974 : runner-up , 1978 : runner-up , 1990 : round of 16 , 1994 : quarter-finals , 1998 : fourth place match schedule : preliminary round june 11 , 2006 : serbia and montenegro - netherlands in leipzig june 16 , 2006 : netherlands - côte d 'ivoire in stuttgart june 21 , 2006 : netherlands - argentina in frankfurt world cup base the dutch have been drawn to baden-württemberg for the world cup .
the team will be residing in the parkhotel adler in hinterzarten . outlook the " oranje " team has to date always reached the round of 16 at least .
this is certainly not too much to expect at the world cup in germany , too .
but the dutch want more , namely the world cup title .
trainer marco van basten has at any rate expressed this goal .
is it possible ?
the last time a dutch team played in a world cup final was in 1978 .
it lost against argentina 1:3 .
at the world cup in germany four years earlier , it also reached the final .
the opponent was germany and the results are known .
the germans became world champions thanks to a 2:1 against cruyff & co . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links koninklijke nederlandse voetbalbond -lrb- knvb -rrb- the official homepage of the dutch football association -lrb- knvb -rrb- feedback send us an e-mail .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .
that 's why i say we can do it , although against england and sweden , it will be very hard . qu xiao interviewed roque santa cruz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : paraguay paraguay are back again for a third world cup in succession , taking their total number of appearances to seven .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "
it 's very unrealistic to believe that when a national team plays somewhere , spectators do n't connect the politics of their home country and everything else that happens there with the players . pablo kummetz interviewed kuno hauck -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .
but just as the country remains divided socially and economically between east and west , german soccer is also split along similar lines .
-lrb- oct .
19 , 2005 -rrb- debate resurfaces over excluding iran from soccer world cup iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree .

the dutch regularly produce teams of exceptional skill and attacking prowess but have yet to win the greatest prize . world cup qualifiers the netherlands failed to qualify for the world cup 2002 in south korea and japan .
so the team was all the more motivated to make it to the tournament in germany four years later .
and it dazzled its way through the qualifiers with not one defeat .
instead , 10 wins and two draws speak a clear language .
the " oranje " team could also win the top spot in group 1 , putting its strongest group rival , the czech republic , in its place .
in the end , it beat the czechs at home in prague outright with 2:0 . stars beginning from goalkeeper edwin van der sar up to the strikers , the positions in the dutch team are roughly equally strong .
in attack , arjen robben and goalscorer ruud van nistelrooy , who both play in the english league , certainly stick out .
the fact that even a top striker like bayern munich 's roy makaay does n't have a regular spot on this international team speaks volumes . trainer with marco van basten , a former striker superstar is coaching the dutch team .
van basten enjoys the respect of his charges already through his successful time as a player .
he was european champion with the dutch team in 1988 and one of the most dangerous forwards in europe .
he succeeded dick advocaat as trainer , who stepped down following sharp criticism of his work after the european cup in 2004 .
van basten can send a homogenous team onto the field .
alongside old hands , he has carefully integrated several young players like arjen robben , wesley sneijder , or rafael van der vaart into the team . world cup history the netherlands is participating in the world cup for the eighth time . 1934 : round of 16 , 1938 : round of 16 , 1974 : runner-up , 1978 : runner-up , 1990 : round of 16 , 1994 : quarter-finals , 1998 : fourth place match schedule : preliminary round june 11 , 2006 : serbia and montenegro - netherlands in leipzig june 16 , 2006 : netherlands - côte d 'ivoire in stuttgart june 21 , 2006 : netherlands - argentina in frankfurt world cup base the dutch have been drawn to baden-württemberg for the world cup .
the team will be residing in the parkhotel adler in hinterzarten . outlook the " oranje " team has to date always reached the round of 16 at least .
this is certainly not too much to expect at the world cup in germany , too .
but the dutch want more , namely the world cup title .
trainer marco van basten has at any rate expressed this goal .
is it possible ?
the last time a dutch team played in a world cup final was in 1978 .
it lost against argentina 1:3 .
at the world cup in germany four years earlier , it also reached the final .
the opponent was germany and the results are known .
the germans became world champions thanks to a 2:1 against cruyff & co . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links koninklijke nederlandse voetbalbond -lrb- knvb -rrb- the official homepage of the dutch football association -lrb- knvb -rrb- feedback send us an e-mail .

members agreed to meet again tuesday after getting reactions from their capitals . " the response we got from our colleagues today suggests that we are pretty close to where they wanted us to be , " britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry told reporters . " our wish remains that the council should act expeditiously on this text and send the clearest possible signal -lrb- to tehran -rrb- ... to reinforce the activities of the -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- agency , " he added . french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere also said he was " encouraged by the reaction " to the revised text , which he noted was " getting a lot of support .

" we must leave sufficient time for diplomacy and for the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- to work ... at least four weeks to six weeks , " he noted . the us ambassador to the un , john bolton , responded : " i do n't think there 's really been much support to go beyond a month , " adding , however , that there was some flexibility on the us side on this point . " the main intent here is to get the iranians to reconsider the mistake that they 've made these last 18 years , trying to pursue nuclear weapons , so the sooner we get that message out and the sooner we hear their response i think the better , " bolton added . us favors short time frame while china , russia urge patience russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , in an interview with the financial times on friday , also dismissed the 14-day period as " not very feasible .

" carrying photographs and banners , they packed the spacious avenue in front of the federal parliament where his coffin lay on a raised , covered platform . party officials demanded a dignified farewell , then called for a minute 's silence for " our president . " " those who are attacking him are not even fit enough to tie his shoelaces , " said milorad vucelic , a senior official in the socialist party which arranged the send-off here after authorities refused a state funeral for the indicted war criminal . some in the crowd carried photographs of radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , the bosnian serb leaders wanted for war crimes by the same un court which was trying their mentor milosevic when he died of a heart attack a week ago . war crimes suspects in attendance several former yugoslav army generals were also present , including the war crimes suspect dragoljub ojdanic , a milosevic general who has been released by the tribunal pending trial . senior party officials spoke , some close to tears , as loyalists stood as a guard of honor beside the coffin in front of the parliament , famously stormed by pro-democracy protesters in the october 2000 uprising that toppled him . in pozarevac , milosevic 's home town 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- southeast of here , a newly-dug grave awaits him in the grounds of the family home , below a linden tree where he first kissed his future wife . tens of thousands expected at home town burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic is expected to enter serb legend despite his crimes party officials have said the 15:00 utc burial would be private , but they expect tens of thousands to flood to his birthplace .

" carrying photographs and banners , they packed the spacious avenue in front of the federal parliament where his coffin lay on a raised , covered platform . party officials demanded a dignified farewell , then called for a minute 's silence for " our president . " " those who are attacking him are not even fit enough to tie his shoelaces , " said milorad vucelic , a senior official in the socialist party which arranged the send-off here after authorities refused a state funeral for the indicted war criminal . some in the crowd carried photographs of radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , the bosnian serb leaders wanted for war crimes by the same un court which was trying their mentor milosevic when he died of a heart attack a week ago . war crimes suspects in attendance several former yugoslav army generals were also present , including the war crimes suspect dragoljub ojdanic , a milosevic general who has been released by the tribunal pending trial . senior party officials spoke , some close to tears , as loyalists stood as a guard of honor beside the coffin in front of the parliament , famously stormed by pro-democracy protesters in the october 2000 uprising that toppled him . in pozarevac , milosevic 's home town 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- southeast of here , a newly-dug grave awaits him in the grounds of the family home , below a linden tree where he first kissed his future wife . tens of thousands expected at home town burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic is expected to enter serb legend despite his crimes party officials have said the 15:00 utc burial would be private , but they expect tens of thousands to flood to his birthplace .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "

workers removed rubbish-bins and metal grills as a safety measure against possible vandalism . demonstrations this week ended in street fights and clouds of tear gas in paris 's latin quarter , in violence which the authorities blamed on outside trouble-makers from the extreme left and right . unions and student leaders predicted at least a million would take part in saturday 's nationwide protests , and urged prime minister dominique de villepin to heed the message from the country and withdraw his controversial measure . protestors demand government reverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests are growing in number and intensity " today we can clearly see that the mobilization is stronger than ever .
either the government listens to reason and withdraws the cpe , or it will be obliged to do so next week - because we will be back in the street , " said bruno julliard of the unef students ' union . an open-ended contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated within the first two years without explanation , the cpe is supposed to encourage employers to take on young staff by removing some of the financial risks involved . drawn up in the wake of last november 's riots in high-immigration city suburbs - where youth unemployment can be as high as 50 percent - the measure was approved by parliament last week as part of a wider equal opportunities law . but the opposition - which includes all the trade unions and a newly-invigorated socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- - says the cpe is a step back from hard-fought labor rights , and will make it more difficult than ever for young people to find long-term employment . half a million students on the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french government faces a real crisis over the labor law two weeks of protests have been building steady in momentum , with strikes affecting some 60 out of the country 's 84 universities and nationwide demonstrations thursday drawing up to half a million university and high-school students . an opinion poll friday showed that 68 percent of the public oppose the youth jobs plan , up from 55 percent just over a week before . the campaign of opposition has developed into a serious political crisis for the 52-year-old prime minister , who has made implementation of the cpe a personal mission but has been criticized - from even within his own union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- - for failing to consult properly in advance . villepin has offered to add new " guarantees " to sweeten the pill and called for " dialogue " , but opponents say they will not enter talks unless the cpe is first suspended . french pm under pressure as crisis grows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin is under the spotlight as the riots rage university chiefs who met villepin on friday night said that the prime minister appeared willing to make new concessions .
" he realizes we are on the edge of a clash , a real clash , " said yannick vallee , vice-president of the conference of university presidents . " we asked him if he was ready to make a gesture to unblock the situation .
he did n't tell us what gesture , but he seemed ready to listen and ready for a significant gesture , " he said . president jacques chirac has so far stood by the prime minister - backing the cpe and calling for negotiations - but commentators said he would be keeping careful watch on the scale of the protests . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de riots in france as job protests heat up police have detained nearly 300 people after students marches turned violent .

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "
it 's very unrealistic to believe that when a national team plays somewhere , spectators do n't connect the politics of their home country and everything else that happens there with the players . pablo kummetz interviewed kuno hauck -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .

" carrying photographs and banners , they packed the spacious avenue in front of the federal parliament where his coffin lay on a raised , covered platform . party officials demanded a dignified farewell , then called for a minute 's silence for " our president . " " those who are attacking him are not even fit enough to tie his shoelaces , " said milorad vucelic , a senior official in the socialist party which arranged the send-off here after authorities refused a state funeral for the indicted war criminal . some in the crowd carried photographs of radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , the bosnian serb leaders wanted for war crimes by the same un court which was trying their mentor milosevic when he died of a heart attack a week ago . war crimes suspects in attendance several former yugoslav army generals were also present , including the war crimes suspect dragoljub ojdanic , a milosevic general who has been released by the tribunal pending trial . senior party officials spoke , some close to tears , as loyalists stood as a guard of honor beside the coffin in front of the parliament , famously stormed by pro-democracy protesters in the october 2000 uprising that toppled him . in pozarevac , milosevic 's home town 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- southeast of here , a newly-dug grave awaits him in the grounds of the family home , below a linden tree where he first kissed his future wife . tens of thousands expected at home town burial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic is expected to enter serb legend despite his crimes party officials have said the 15:00 utc burial would be private , but they expect tens of thousands to flood to his birthplace .
several hundred were already watching the belgrade ceremony on a town centre screen . opponents of his regime , who have slammed what they call attempts over the past week at " glorification " of his 13-year autocratic rule , have organized a counter-rally in a central belgrade square to coincide with the burial . milosevic was standing trial at the un court in the hague on more than 60 charges over his leading role in the bloody 1990s balkans conflicts , including genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , when he was found dead last saturday in his prison cell . mihajlo markovic , a close milosevic ally , called him " one of the greatest sons of the serbian people . " " our slobodan has gone into history , " he added .
" rarely is such a man born , able to arouse such power in the people , to unite so many people . " " wanted " family members stay away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former president 's passing is threatening to reopen old wounds party officials confirmed neither mira markovic nor the couple 's son marko were returning for the funeral .
they said " threats and blackmail " had prevented them flying in from russia , where they now live , and accused authorities in serbia of failing to provide guarantees she would not be arrested . milosevic 's daughter marija , who lives in montenegro , serbia 's federation partner , said she would not go either because of a family row over where her father should be buried .
she was to attend a church requiem instead . milosevic 's elder brother borislav , who lives in moscow , is recovering from a heart operation and can not attend . slobodan milosevic was toppled after his 13 years of bully-boy nationalism shattered the balkans , lost four wars , ruined the economy and isolated him and his nation from the international community . victims of slobo 's wars shed no tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slaughter at srebrenica is a drak stain on the region 's soul in srebrenica , the bosnian town where some 8,000 muslim men and boys were slaughtered by bosnian serb forces in europe 's worst massacre since world war ii , there was no sympathy for the death of a man many say escaped justice . " why would i care for him ?
all i can think of is finding my husband 's body and give him a proper burial , " zejneba cengic , who returned to srebrenica in 2002 , said . meanwhile anti-milosevic activists in serbia prepared for their own rally here later saturday . marjan milosavljevic , a 27-year-old student , said he had already bought 30 balloons , the emblem the protesters have chosen .
" some of the balloons are for my friends who have fled the country because of milosevic , " he said .
" but they were thrilled with this action and wanted to support it somehow .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .
that 's why i say we can do it , although against england and sweden , it will be very hard . qu xiao interviewed roque santa cruz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : paraguay paraguay are back again for a third world cup in succession , taking their total number of appearances to seven .

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .
it has two centers in berlin , and opened a branch in a rough neighborhood in hamburg earlier this year , with a branch planned for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child poverty exists in germany - and it is growing in the past years , poverty in germany has been on the rise .
a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .
" we always prick up our ears when we hear something that implies that you ca n't be healthy without food supplements , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is real food sufficient to provide vitamins ?
in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "
and besides , he argued , vitamins are n't anything bad for you , like cigarettes or alcohol . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business poised to fill growing social gap german firms have a long history of social involvement .

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .

a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .
" we always prick up our ears when we hear something that implies that you ca n't be healthy without food supplements , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is real food sufficient to provide vitamins ?
in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "

i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .

what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .

i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .
it offers care to some 250 underprivileged children each day , giving them a warm meal and a place to go to play games , get help with homework , or receive counseling . increase in poverty last year , the arch was awarded a human rights prize .
it has two centers in berlin , and opened a branch in a rough neighborhood in hamburg earlier this year , with a branch planned for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child poverty exists in germany - and it is growing in the past years , poverty in germany has been on the rise .
a report on poverty from 2005 showed 13.1 percent of germans were at risk of poverty , or earned less than 60 percent of the median german income .
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , some 1.5 million children under age 18 live below the poverty line in germany . nonprofit vs. for-profit " we get children from families who often do n't have enough money to do the things they would like to do for their children , " said the arch 's lindloff .
but as necessary as their work is , some are nonetheless questioning the wisdom of joining forces with a for-profit vitamin maker .
germany 's consumer protection agency is aware of the agreement between the arch and the food-supplement visan . questionable tie ? " we have noticed an increase in such questionable cooperations , " said angelika michel-drees , nutrition division head at the consumer protection agency , who sees the visan-arch deal as dubious .
" we always prick up our ears when we hear something that implies that you ca n't be healthy without food supplements , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is real food sufficient to provide vitamins ?
in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "
and besides , he argued , vitamins are n't anything bad for you , like cigarettes or alcohol . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business poised to fill growing social gap german firms have a long history of social involvement .

dw-world talked to the bayern player and paraguayan superstar . dw-world.de : is it possible that your injury is going to prevent you from playing your best at the world cup ? roque santa cruz : it 's going to be tight , regarding time .
but like we planned , i 'm going to start training a little bit , playing with the ball .
right now , everything 's on schedule and i 'm not having any problems with my knee .
i think i 'm going to play in the world cup , although there 's still the question of whether i 'll be at one hundred percent or not .
i just ca n't say exactly .
i still do n't even know if i 'm going to have a place on the team . you are the most famous player from paraguay .
how do you see your responsibility at the world cup ? for me , this is a special world cup , because it 's being played here and i play here as well .
and because of the great experience that we gained at the world cup in korean and japan , i think we 'll play better this time and do better . this is the third time in a row that paraguay has participated in the world cup. the country is considered the third strongest team in south america , behind brazil and argentina .
how do you see that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa cruz has high hopes even though after these qualifications , like last time , we came in fourth , i do think paraguay is the third strongest team in south america , after brazil and argentina .
although there are others , who are also very strong , i do think that paraguay is firmly in third place . many people say that brazil has the best team .
but when you look back , brazil actually has only managed to win the world cup title in europe one time .
do you think brazil will win it this time or do other teams have a chance ? i do think that brazil has the best team and the best players in every position .
still , it 's always a question of luck and how things play out .
i do n't think it will as easy for the brazilians this time as it was in korea and japan , when the team won every game so easily .
i think we have other teams now , which are a little stronger than they were before , like england , italy and perhaps germany .
there are national teams , very strong ones , which are going to make things tough for brazil .
but still , for me , brazil is still the favorite . in the last two world cups , paraguay made it through the group phase .
this time paraguay is in a group with england and sweden , both very strong teams .
what do you think of the group phase ? yes , we are n't so happy with the draw .
but whatever the case , for me personally , there is nothing better in a world cup than playing against teams which have very big names in the competition .
i think that while it 's going to be difficult , we can do it .
i know that many say that england and sweden will advance , and we wo n't .
but i also think that there 's a positive side , since the pressure is n't on us , but on sweden and england .
that 's why i say we can do it , although against england and sweden , it will be very hard . qu xiao interviewed roque santa cruz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : paraguay paraguay are back again for a third world cup in succession , taking their total number of appearances to seven .

angola 's success in their sixth world cup campaign can be put down to their home-pitch potency - they won all their games at " la cidadela " stadium . stars team captain fabrice akwa is the angolan man to watch .
the former benfica lissabon player , who is now plying his trade in qatar , was a near-guarantee for angola 's success in the qualification matches .
when the pressure was on , akwa scored his team 's deciding goals . trainer the angolans are n't shy when it comes to honoring their national team coach luis oliveira goncalves , with some fervent fans calling for him to receive a contract for life .
even after failing to reach the african cup of nations quarter-finals , goncalves still enjoys much popular support in the southwest african country . world cup history the angolans are making their first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 11 : angola - portugal in cologne june 16 : mexico - angola in hanover june 21 : iran - angola in leipzig world cup base the angolan team will be staying in lower saxony 's celle during the world cup . outlook as world cup rookies , getting out of the group round is the most angola can realistically hope for - and that alone would be a feat worth celebrating in the capital luanda .

angola 's success in their sixth world cup campaign can be put down to their home-pitch potency - they won all their games at " la cidadela " stadium . stars team captain fabrice akwa is the angolan man to watch .
the former benfica lissabon player , who is now plying his trade in qatar , was a near-guarantee for angola 's success in the qualification matches .
when the pressure was on , akwa scored his team 's deciding goals . trainer the angolans are n't shy when it comes to honoring their national team coach luis oliveira goncalves , with some fervent fans calling for him to receive a contract for life .
even after failing to reach the african cup of nations quarter-finals , goncalves still enjoys much popular support in the southwest african country . world cup history the angolans are making their first appearance in the world cup finals . match schedule : preliminary round june 11 : angola - portugal in cologne june 16 : mexico - angola in hanover june 21 : iran - angola in leipzig world cup base the angolan team will be staying in lower saxony 's celle during the world cup . outlook as world cup rookies , getting out of the group round is the most angola can realistically hope for - and that alone would be a feat worth celebrating in the capital luanda .
games against mexico and portugal put goncalves ' team against two top-notch sides , and the final match against iran , another team with nothing to lose , should also prove difficult . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links federacao angolana de futebol -lrb- f.a.f. -rrb-

the move is an example of the increasing trend toward " social sponsoring , " where non-profit and for-profit activities mix with the intention of benefiting both parties . the head of the arch , kai-uwe lindloff , said the group decided to work together with limburg-based orthosan , maker of the food supplement visan , as a means of staying afloat . seeking financing paths to date , the project has covered 95 percent of its 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 600,000 -rrb- in annual costs through donations .
but " social sponsoring through firms could open up a new path to financing , " lindloff told the edp news service in late february in berlin . the arch was founded 10 years ago in a downtrodden berlin neighborhood by well-known german pastor and children 's activist bernd siggelkow .

in this case , the children 's project is being used as a marketing tool for visan , michel-drees said .
" profitable interests are hiding behind the cloak of doing good . " indeed , a closer look at the details of the deal shows the potential conflicts of such a connection .
at 30 euros per package , visan is much more expensive than over the counter vitamins , which retail for about a quarter of that price . in fact , visan is sold mainly on doctors ' recommendations .
the firm orthosan is planning a marketing blitz for visan at doctors ' offices to increase sales , and at the same time the supplement will be tied to the arch - and the project 's good deeds - by carrying the arch logo .
a portion of the price of each packet sold will then go on to the arch . despite the tie-in , arch founder siggelkow told the dpa news agency he does n't feel his organization is being used : " we are n't selling anything , and our kids are n't walking around with visan logos on their t-shirts . "

the organization is campaigning for the soccer world to view human rights is an issue that it should acknowledge and take action to uphold . dw-world.de : what is the coalition 's campaign about ? kuno hauck : human rights issues affect every level of civil and political life , and sports is a part of that .
it was an issue 30 years ago , in 1978 , and the question was : could germany send its national soccer team to argentina , where people were being tortured and murdered ?
amnesty international started the campaign back then : " soccer , yes ; torture , no . "
it was clear that during and after the world cup , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and even parliamentarians were addressing human rights issues in soccer in a rather naive fashion .
the approach was more like : " soccer and human rights have nothing to do with each other ; let the athletes play their game and let the human rights activists deal with their issues . " we 've begun a petition campaign and are demanding that the dfb develop a code of ethics for major sports events and that it apologize for what happened in the past .
but they 've just refused .
in other words , they said they would n't sit down with us to discuss things and that they reject our campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a friendly match between germany and turkey should the german team not have played in argentina in 1978 ?
should it not go to countries to places where human rights are violated now ? the dfb should develop a very clear code of ethics .
there could be countries where we say , " no , we 're not going there . "
one has to define certain conditions or prerequisites for a trip .
people should be able to express their ideas about civil rights ; freedom of expression about concerns should not be forbidden .
one has to wonder what will happen in three years in peking when the german olympic team travels there .
people know that human rights are not at the top of the priority list in china , that human rights are abused there .
are we supposed to go there and just ignore all of that ? that 's the central issue .
we 're not saying a team or our national team should n't go to a particular country .
we 're just asking the dfb to define the conditions there must be for the team to go , and to ask : " under what conditions would we not go there ? " should the teams from countries where human rights are violated not be invited to the world cup in germany this summer ? all teams should be allowed to play and should be invited , but issues like human rights in their country should be addressed during the matches . this summer the iran team will come to play in nuremberg .
we wonder how we should deal with the country .
should we be open to them or boycott them ?
we should go to the game , but we should also be able to discuss human rights issues that pertain to iran . how did athletes react back in 1978 and how do they react now to your coalition 's demands ? back in 1978 , there were some players who expressed criticism toward argentina .
there were others who just said : " what 's happening in argentina does n't concern me .
i just want to play soccer . "
but we think that 's naive .
you ca n't just say : " sports is sports , politics is politics . "
it 's very unrealistic to believe that when a national team plays somewhere , spectators do n't connect the politics of their home country and everything else that happens there with the players . pablo kummetz interviewed kuno hauck -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .

earth microbes in these meteorites could have seeded the organic-rich world with life , researchers believe .
they think the impact on earth that killed off the dinosaurs could have ejected enough material for some to reach far-off moons such as titan .
details were unveiled at a major science conference in houston , us .
the theory of panspermia holds that life on planets like earth and mars was seeded from space , perhaps hitching a ride on meteorites and comets .
to get terrestrial , life-bearing rocks to escape the earth 's atmosphere and reach space requires an impact by an asteroid or comet between 10 and 50km across .
only a handful of recorded strikes in geological history fit the bill .
million-year journey one of them is the asteroid strike 65 million years ago , which punched a crater between 160 and 240km wide in what is today the yucatan peninsula , mexico .
it 's not clear if microbes can survive titan 's freezing temperatures brett gladman , from the university of british columbia -lrb- ubc -rrb- in vancouver , and colleagues calculated that about 600 million fragments from such an impact would escape from earth into an orbit around the sun .
some of these would have sufficient escape velocities to reach jupiter and saturn in roughly a million years .
using computer models , they plotted the behaviour of these fragments once they were in orbit .
from this , they calculated the expected number that would hit certain moons of jupiter and saturn .
the principal targets they chose , titan and europa , are of considerable interest to astrobiologists , the community of researchers who study the origin of life on earth and its implications for the habitability of other planetary bodies .
titan is rich in organic compounds , which provide a potential energy source for primitive life forms , europa is thought to harbour a liquid water ocean under its thick crust of ice .
hitting at speed dr gladman 's team calculated that up to 20 terrestrial rocks from a large impact on earth would reach titan .
these would strike titan 's upper atmosphere at 10-15 km / s .
at this velocity , the cruise down to the surface might be comfortable enough for microbes to survive the journey .
around 100 terrestrial meteoroids could possibly have hit europa but the news was more bleak for europa .
by contrast with the handful that hit titan , about 100 terrestrial meteoroids hit the icy moon .
but jupiter 's gravity boosts their speed such that they strike europa 's surface at an average 25 km / s , with some hitting at 40 km / s .
dr gladman said other scientists had investigated the survival of amino acids hitting a planetary surface at this speed and they were " not good " .
" it 's frustrating if you 're a microbe that 's been wandering the universe for a million years to then die striking the surface of europa , " dr gladman mused .
asked after his presentation by one scientist whether he thought microbes would be able to survive titan 's freezing temperatures , dr gladman answered : " that 's for you people to decide , i 'm just the pizza delivery boy . "

earth microbes in these meteorites could have seeded the organic-rich world with life , researchers believe .
they think the impact on earth that killed off the dinosaurs could have ejected enough material for some to reach far-off moons such as titan .
details were unveiled at a major science conference in houston , us .
the theory of panspermia holds that life on planets like earth and mars was seeded from space , perhaps hitching a ride on meteorites and comets .
to get terrestrial , life-bearing rocks to escape the earth 's atmosphere and reach space requires an impact by an asteroid or comet between 10 and 50km across .
only a handful of recorded strikes in geological history fit the bill .
million-year journey one of them is the asteroid strike 65 million years ago , which punched a crater between 160 and 240km wide in what is today the yucatan peninsula , mexico .
it 's not clear if microbes can survive titan 's freezing temperatures brett gladman , from the university of british columbia -lrb- ubc -rrb- in vancouver , and colleagues calculated that about 600 million fragments from such an impact would escape from earth into an orbit around the sun .
some of these would have sufficient escape velocities to reach jupiter and saturn in roughly a million years .
using computer models , they plotted the behaviour of these fragments once they were in orbit .
from this , they calculated the expected number that would hit certain moons of jupiter and saturn .
the principal targets they chose , titan and europa , are of considerable interest to astrobiologists , the community of researchers who study the origin of life on earth and its implications for the habitability of other planetary bodies .
titan is rich in organic compounds , which provide a potential energy source for primitive life forms , europa is thought to harbour a liquid water ocean under its thick crust of ice .
hitting at speed dr gladman 's team calculated that up to 20 terrestrial rocks from a large impact on earth would reach titan .
these would strike titan 's upper atmosphere at 10-15 km / s .
at this velocity , the cruise down to the surface might be comfortable enough for microbes to survive the journey .
around 100 terrestrial meteoroids could possibly have hit europa but the news was more bleak for europa .
by contrast with the handful that hit titan , about 100 terrestrial meteoroids hit the icy moon .
but jupiter 's gravity boosts their speed such that they strike europa 's surface at an average 25 km / s , with some hitting at 40 km / s .
dr gladman said other scientists had investigated the survival of amino acids hitting a planetary surface at this speed and they were " not good " .
" it 's frustrating if you 're a microbe that 's been wandering the universe for a million years to then die striking the surface of europa , " dr gladman mused .
asked after his presentation by one scientist whether he thought microbes would be able to survive titan 's freezing temperatures , dr gladman answered : " that 's for you people to decide , i 'm just the pizza delivery boy . "

" it 's frustrating if you 're a microbe that 's been wandering the universe for a million years to then die striking the surface of europa , " dr gladman mused .
asked after his presentation by one scientist whether he thought microbes would be able to survive titan 's freezing temperatures , dr gladman answered : " that 's for you people to decide , i 'm just the pizza delivery boy . "
the ubc researcher gave his presentation at the astrobiology session held at the lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas .

three years after the us-led military action , mr reid rejected claims that the country was wracked by violence and gripped by civil war .
he said there had been progress and most of the country was under control .
there is not civil war now , nor is it inevitable , nor is it imminent .
defence secretary john reid he told bbc radio 4 's today programme the picture was mixed and admitted progress had been held up by the terrorists .
but he said he would be telling iraqi leaders : " a government of national unity would be the biggest signal in iraq that terrorists will not be allowed to do what they are trying to do which is divide iraqi from iraqi . "
a speedy government would not only fill the power vacuum the terrorists sought to occupy , but would bring different ethnic groups together , he said .
he admitted insurgents had seen some success in " pushing people into their sectarian enclaves " .
but he added : " that is not civil war .
there is not civil war now , nor is it inevitable , nor is it imminent . "
' not ready ' he also denied reports that iraq was " ungovernable " , saying that most of the violence was concentrated in and around baghdad .
only 2 % of violent incidents were taking place in british controlled areas , he pointed out .
looking back three years , it is now becoming clearer how difficult things were from the start three years after invasion he also urged people marching in london and other capital cities on saturday against the presence of multi-national forces in iraq to consider supporting progress in the country .
they had a clear choice between backing the democratic developments desired by ordinary iraqis or supporting the terrorists dividing the country .
mr reid has praised the progress made by iraqi security forces , but says they were not ready to control whole provinces .
meet the troops the government has announced uk troop numbers are to fall by 800 to 7,000 .
the reduction comes as iraqi security forces begin to take on more responsibilities for themselves .

the arc of his life , his rise and fall , is faustian .
he made a pact with the twin demons of balkan nationalism and war .
the demons propelled him to power and , for a while , kept him there .
but he lost control of them , and they destroyed him in the end .
what were the decisive moments in his 20-year flirtation with disaster - those moments on which history turns ?
there are too many to be comprehensive , but here are a few episodes on mr milosevic 's road to ruin .
24 april , 1987 : mr milosevic addresses a crowd of angry serbs in kosovo .
they are feeling threatened by their albanian neighbours .
" no-one , " he says , " should dare to beat you . "
that single sentence changes his life .
the crowd begin to chant his name , " slobbo !
slobbo ! "
an old yugoslav taboo on nationalist sentiment is broken .
six months later , he is president of serbia and a serb national hero .
24 january , 1991 : mr milosevic has a secret meeting with slovenia 's president , milan kucan .
between them , they agree to the dissolution of yugoslavia .
slovenia can go , mr milosevic says .
there are no serbs there .
but croatia is different .
there are parts of croatia where serbs are in the majority , and mr milosevic decides that these territories will be taken from croatia - by force , if need be .
mr milosevic 's close ally borisav jovic wrote in his diary that day : " today may have changed the whole course of yugoslavia and the crisis . "
march 1991 : mr milosevic has armed the serb minority in croatia .
they have proclaimed their own state .
i remember them proudly unfurling new maps , with redrawn borders .
the new , expanded serbia they want includes two-thirds of bosnia and one third of croatia .
these territories are to be known as western serbia .
mr milosevic has sent the yugoslav army to secure these territories .
but the croats fight back .
by summer there is open war .
18 october , 1991 : the presidents of the six yugoslav republics sit around a table in the hague with british lord carrington .
there is a peace plan .
it gives the serbs in croatia widespread autonomy - their own schools , their own language , their own tv and radio stations , even their own police force .
five of the six presidents say they will sign .
mr milosevic alone refuses .
the war goes on and eventually into bosnia .
april 1993 : the war in bosnia is a year old .
mr milosevic is in a hotel room in athens with radovan karadzic , the leader of the bosnian serbs .
mr milosevic wants an end to the fighting , as economic sanctions are damaging him .
he is trying to persuade mr karadzic to sign the latest peace plan , drawn up by lord owen .
mr karadzic - once mr milosevic 's proxy in bosnia - says no .
mr milosevic , who turned on the fighting like a tap , now knows he can no longer so easily turn it off .
he has lost control of the demons he unleashed .
winter 1993 : i am sitting in a cafe in belgrade .
mr milosevic has been printing money to pay for the war in bosnia .
there is hyper-inflation .
the rate is now 3,000,000 % a month .
prices go up every hour .
a friend says to me that if he stops off for a beer on the way home from work , if he thinks he might like two beers , he orders them both at the same time , because by the time he has finished the first one , the price of the second one is double .
the inflation has wiped out everybody 's life savings and pensions .
the economy is now in the hands of organised criminal gangs .
5 october 2000 : mr milosevic has fought and lost four wars .
he has now also lost an election , but refuses to concede defeat .
the people come out into the streets .
he asks the army to intervene .
the army refuses .
he is overthrown .
it reads like a cautionary tale .
nationalism and war kept him in power for a full decade after every other communist leader in europe had been swept away .
key to his success was that he persuaded serbian public opinion to walk with him , hand in hand , for most of the journey .
today , serbia will not only be burying their former leader .
they will be laying to rest a chapter of their own history which some still view with pride - but many more with regret and even shame .

it gives the serbs in croatia widespread autonomy - their own schools , their own language , their own tv and radio stations , even their own police force .
five of the six presidents say they will sign .
mr milosevic alone refuses .
the war goes on and eventually into bosnia .
april 1993 : the war in bosnia is a year old .
mr milosevic is in a hotel room in athens with radovan karadzic , the leader of the bosnian serbs .
mr milosevic wants an end to the fighting , as economic sanctions are damaging him .
he is trying to persuade mr karadzic to sign the latest peace plan , drawn up by lord owen .
mr karadzic - once mr milosevic 's proxy in bosnia - says no .
mr milosevic , who turned on the fighting like a tap , now knows he can no longer so easily turn it off .
he has lost control of the demons he unleashed .
winter 1993 : i am sitting in a cafe in belgrade .
mr milosevic has been printing money to pay for the war in bosnia .
there is hyper-inflation .
the rate is now 3,000,000 % a month .
prices go up every hour .
a friend says to me that if he stops off for a beer on the way home from work , if he thinks he might like two beers , he orders them both at the same time , because by the time he has finished the first one , the price of the second one is double .
mass demonstrations demanded milosevic 's removal from power the inflation has wiped out everybody 's life savings and pensions .
the economy is now in the hands of organised criminal gangs .
5 october 2000 : mr milosevic has fought and lost four wars .
he has now also lost an election , but refuses to concede defeat .
the people come out into the streets .
he asks the army to intervene .
the army refuses .
he is overthrown .
it reads like a cautionary tale .
nationalism and war kept him in power for a full decade after every other communist leader in europe had been swept away .
key to his success was that he persuaded serbian public opinion to walk with him , hand in hand , for most of the journey .
today , serbia will not only be burying their former leader .
they will be laying to rest a chapter of their own history which some still view with pride - but many more with regret and even shame .

the arc of his life , his rise and fall , is faustian .
he made a pact with the twin demons of balkan nationalism and war .
the demons propelled him to power and , for a while , kept him there .
but he lost control of them , and they destroyed him in the end .
what were the decisive moments in his 20-year flirtation with disaster - those moments on which history turns ?
there are too many to be comprehensive , but here are a few episodes on mr milosevic 's road to ruin .
24 april , 1987 : mr milosevic addresses a crowd of angry serbs in kosovo .
they are feeling threatened by their albanian neighbours .
" no-one , " he says , " should dare to beat you . "
that single sentence changes his life .
the crowd begin to chant his name , " slobbo !
slobbo ! "
an old yugoslav taboo on nationalist sentiment is broken .
six months later , he is president of serbia and a serb national hero .
24 january , 1991 : mr milosevic has a secret meeting with slovenia 's president , milan kucan .
between them , they agree to the dissolution of yugoslavia .
slovenia can go , mr milosevic says .
there are no serbs there .
but croatia is different .
there are parts of croatia where serbs are in the majority , and mr milosevic decides that these territories will be taken from croatia - by force , if need be .
mr milosevic 's close ally borisav jovic wrote in his diary that day : " today may have changed the whole course of yugoslavia and the crisis . "
march 1991 : mr milosevic has armed the serb minority in croatia .
they have proclaimed their own state .
the war spread throughout the former yugoslavia i remember them proudly unfurling new maps , with redrawn borders .
the new , expanded serbia they want includes two-thirds of bosnia and one third of croatia .
these territories are to be known as western serbia .
mr milosevic has sent the yugoslav army to secure these territories .
but the croats fight back .
by summer there is open war .
18 october , 1991 : the presidents of the six yugoslav republics sit around a table in the hague with british lord carrington .
there is a peace plan .
it gives the serbs in croatia widespread autonomy - their own schools , their own language , their own tv and radio stations , even their own police force .
five of the six presidents say they will sign .
mr milosevic alone refuses .
the war goes on and eventually into bosnia .

three towns have entered the race - or at least , competitive crawl - to be the first in wales officially welcomed into the slow food movement .
llandeilo , machynlleth and mold all hope to join the international campaign to promote local produce and combat fast food culture .
open meetings have been held and food festivals planned to boost the bids .
supporters hope by becoming an official " cittaslow " - italian for slow city - they will boost tourism in their area .
on monday a delegation from machynlleth will travel to ludlow , shropshire , the first cittaslow in the uk , to see at first hand how the concept works .
on the same day llandeilo 's action group holds its first meeting .
but mold may have already stolen a march with the formation of a hotel and restaurant association and plans for its first food festival at the end of september .
the first slow food association was founded in the mid-80s in piedmont , italy , to express concern about the spread of fast food outlets .
if it is a race , it 's a very slow race andrea mearns the group says it has 80,000 members in more than 100 countries .
graeme kidd , president of the cittaslow movement in the uk , said : " if you like , the race is on to see which welsh town will be first to apply for membership - although we do n't really race in the slow movement .
" it is all about improving quality of life in your town and celebrating the differences that make it special . "
attributes needed by an aspiring slow town include a lack of fast food outlets , a long history , a thriving arts culture and a good range of quality cafes , restaurants , hotels and shops .
" it 's not too daunting a task - indeed , most towns will find they are already on the way in terms of meeting the application requirements , " added mr kidd .
andrea mearns , who is working on mold 's bid , said : " mold is a food town but cittaslow is not just about food , it 's about the infrastructure , the environment , hospitality and all sorts of goals which we are keen on . "
she said the bid was already helping community spirit and reinforcing pride in the town .
" it would be nice to be the first in wales , but it 's not really a race .
if it is a race , it 's a very slow race . "

halabja 's horrific history is symbolised by a 30-metre-tall triangular structure in the centre of town .
the names of the dead are inscribed in white on the black marble walls of a circular hall .
there are photos of disfigured residents and lifeless children piled on top of each other and statues replicating scenes from the attack .
but this year , the monument became a symbol for something else - the anger of local people at what they perceive to be corruption and neglect .
as officials prepared for a day of mourning , angry protesters took to the streets chanting " down , down with the government " .
by the end of the day , between 3,000 and 5,000 people - including many relatives of those who had died in the gas attacks - had joined the protest .
anger groups clashed with security forces , one person was killed and the monument was torched , sending black smoke billowing over the town .
so why had the monument been the focus of such anger ?
on this day : halabja attack just two years ago , the then top us administrator in iraq l paul bremer stood at the halabja monument with kurdish leader jalal talabani , who is now president of iraq .
mr bremer said the town served as proof that the us-led invasion of iraq was justified , and that the coalition would establish a $ 1m fund for halabja .
mr talabani urged people to " come to halabja to see how mass destruction arms -lrb- were -rrb- used . "
now , the people of the town are saying that officials have used the atrocities for their own political ends , but they have seen little in return .
promises the events in halabja are evidence of growing dissatisfaction against the local government in the kurdish area , which is dominated by two parties , the patriotic union of kurdistan , led by mr talabani , and the kurdistan democratic party .
thursday 's demonstration was mostly made up of young people , who accuse regional authorities of inaction , complacency , corruption and nepotism .
mariwan hama-saeed , a local reporter with the institute for war and peace reporting , was in the town during the protests .
he told the bbc news website that people were fed up with kurdish regional government officials turning up each year to mark the anniversary but failing to deliver on promises to provide basics services and rebuild the city .
entire neighbourhoods in the city are rubble , streets remain unpaved and schools are dingy and decrepit .
" the city suffers from major construction problems and a lack of basic services , such as water and electricity .
many people are still suffering from the effects of the chemical poisoning but there is n't the adequate health care to help them , " he said .
he said this was the latest in a series of street protests in kurdish areas over recent months , with people complaining about issues ranging from poor water and electricity to housing problems .
" only last week there was a protest in mr talabani 's home town , " he said .
security " people say if the rest of iraq is having problems with reconstruction and lack of basic services , the excuse is because of the insurgents and the lack of security but in kurdistan there is nothing like that - the security situation is very safe . "
this safety element is drawing in foreign businesses who want to relocate from other , less secure , areas of iraq .
international aid has poured into the region and the economy is now booming in oil-rich areas such as irbil .
mr hama-saeed says that across the kurdish region , people were questioning where the money is going .
" people believe officials are using it for their own interests , " he said .
mahmoud othman , an independent kurdish member of the national parliament , told the bbc news website that the local government had many problems that it needed to solve .
" they definitely have to do something , in halabja and in others areas , otherwise there will be more problems , " he said .
he said a high-level committee that included members of the regional political parties had already been set up to meet with the demonstrators and discuss their grievances .
he said the committee would also be investigating whether " enemies or terrorists " had infiltrated the protest and targeted the monument .
after previous demonstrations in the region , local authorities , have blamed militant islamic elements for fomenting trouble , says mr hama-saeed .
but he said this appeared to be an attempt to deflect attention away from the civil unrest .
" i saw no evidence of this in halabja , " he said .
the kurdish regional government has been proud of the fact that the north has , so far , escaped most of the violence that has wracked much of the rest of the country .
but , as mr othman says they will need to act if they are to stem the growing anger .

promises the events in halabja are evidence of growing dissatisfaction against the local government in the kurdish area , which is dominated by two parties , the patriotic union of kurdistan , led by mr talabani , and the kurdistan democratic party .
thursday 's demonstration was mostly made up of young people , who accuse regional authorities of inaction , complacency , corruption and nepotism .
protesters attacked the monument to the 1988 victims mariwan hama-saeed , a local reporter with the institute for war and peace reporting , was in the town during the protests .
he told the bbc news website that people were fed up with kurdish regional government officials turning up each year to mark the anniversary but failing to deliver on promises to provide basics services and rebuild the city .
entire neighbourhoods in the city are rubble , streets remain unpaved and schools are dingy and decrepit .
" the city suffers from major construction problems and a lack of basic services , such as water and electricity .
many people are still suffering from the effects of the chemical poisoning but there is n't the adequate health care to help them , " he said .
he said this was the latest in a series of street protests in kurdish areas over recent months , with people complaining about issues ranging from poor water and electricity to housing problems .
" only last week there was a protest in mr talabani 's home town , " he said .
security " people say if the rest of iraq is having problems with reconstruction and lack of basic services , the excuse is because of the insurgents and the lack of security but in kurdistan there is nothing like that - the security situation is very safe . "
this safety element is drawing in foreign businesses who want to relocate from other , less secure , areas of iraq .
international aid has poured into the region and the economy is now booming in oil-rich areas such as irbil .
mr hama-saeed says that across the kurdish region , people were questioning where the money is going .
" people believe officials are using it for their own interests , " he said .
mahmoud othman , an independent kurdish member of the national parliament , told the bbc news website that the local government had many problems that it needed to solve .
" they definitely have to do something , in halabja and in others areas , otherwise there will be more problems , " he said .
he said a high-level committee that included members of the regional political parties had already been set up to meet with the demonstrators and discuss their grievances .
he said the committee would also be investigating whether " enemies or terrorists " had infiltrated the protest and targeted the monument .
after previous demonstrations in the region , local authorities , have blamed militant islamic elements for fomenting trouble , says mr hama-saeed .
but he said this appeared to be an attempt to deflect attention away from the civil unrest .
" i saw no evidence of this in halabja , " he said .
the kurdish regional government has been proud of the fact that the north has , so far , escaped most of the violence that has wracked much of the rest of the country .
but , as mr othman says they will need to act if they are to stem the growing anger .
