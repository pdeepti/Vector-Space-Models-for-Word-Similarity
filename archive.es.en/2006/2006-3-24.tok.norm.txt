can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospital doctors call nationwide strike doctors at german university clinics and state hospitals voted by an overwhelming majority wednesday to begin a nationwide strike this week for better pay and working conditions .
-lrb- march 15 , 2006 -rrb- service sector strikes spread through german states germany 's biggest public sector strikes since the early 1990s spread when workers at the university hospital in frankfurt stopped work , making the state of hesse the 12th to join in with industrial action .

" during my conversation with the president , i also had the impression that there is a firm conviction that this will be done , and i hope we will now reach a solution , " she said . according to german government sources , karzai had assured the chancellor that a decision which would respect rahman 's human rights would be reached quickly . psycho evaluation could provide way out for karzai 's government a supreme court spokesman has said that rahman , who switched to christianity in germany 16 years ago and returned to afghanistan in 2002 , may be mentally unfit to stand trial and would be subjected to psychological testing . analysts said this would be an easy way out for kabul , amid fears the case could cause a rift with the western countries on which it relies to rebuild from war and suppress an insurgency led by the islamist taliban movement . the un special representative for afghanistan tom königs told german radio he was confident that rahman would not be executed . case prompts concern in the west the case has triggered strong protests in much of the western world . the united nations and nato members germany and italy , which have troops in afghanistan , have expressed concern over rahman 's trial and warned of a rift with kabul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai is wedged between western pressure and arch conservatives in his own country the us too raised pressure on karzai this week to free rahman .
secretary of state condoleezza rice said she phoned karzai this week specifically to hammer home " in the strongest possible terms " washington 's concern over the proceedings against rahman . " there is no more fundamental issue for the united states than freedom of religion and religious conscience , " the chief us diplomat told reporters . karzai was elected after us forces helped topple the taliban in retaliation for harbouring the al-qaeda group blamed for the sept .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .

" we are on the right track in europe - trying to build europe on concrete results , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso at a closing press conference in brussels on friday . " the healthy thing about the debate is that , i think , it 's being won by those in favor of more open markets , " said british prime minister tony blair , adding : " the arguments are moving , in our view , in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , center , with polish leaders at the eu summit the traditional eu spring summit was focused firmly on breathing new life into the bloc 's so-called lisbon agenda , launched in the portuguese capital in 2000 to make europe the most competitive economy by the end of the decade . hope for calm agreement but the strategy has struggled to make any difference in concrete terms : while the united states and japan enjoy an economic resurgence , latest eu data put growth at a paltry 1.3 percent last year . eu leaders , still reeling from political earthquakes last year when the bloc 's first-ever constitution was rejected by french and dutch voters , had hoped the brussels summit would provide a chance for calm accord on economic strategy . energy deal amid protectionism row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german energy giant e.on had its eyes trained on spanish energy company endesa but in the run-up to the meeting , tension built over alleged protectionism in a string of cases including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . italy 's silvio berlusconi even tried to rally support for a joint statement denouncing protectionism on the eve of the summit .
but in brussels itself he kept a low profile , and few others were willing to stick their necks out . " there was not a confrontational debate , " said barroso . the eu commission chief was visibly satisfied to have won support for plans to forge a new joint energy strategy : notably by bolstering security of supplies , hooking up europe 's grids and better exploiting renewable energy sources . alarm bells sounded in eu capitals in january after europe was caught in the crossfire of a gas price war between russia and ukraine , leading to supply cuts which underlined the continent 's dependence on its giant eastern neighbor . " when we make the history of european integration we will say that energy policy was born on march 23-24 , 2006 , " said barroso .
" the conclusions are very , very important . " action against belarus another issue forced its way onto the summit agenda after new arrests in minsk following last week 's contested polls swept authoritarian president alexander lukashenko into a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko eu leaders agreed to implement new sanctions on the ex-soviet state , including on lukashenko himself .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .
computer players have a distinctive reality management and know exactly what is reality and what is play .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.03.2006 scientists debate violent influence at gaming conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say players can distinguish between a man-eating monster and reality according to some , violent computer games are the scourge of society , the corrupters of the young and should be banned .
but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .
computer players have a distinctive reality management and know exactly what is reality and what is play .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .
computer players have a distinctive reality management and know exactly what is reality and what is play .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe . " this would include developing common foreign and trade policy to support energy goals , new ways to diversify energy supplies and transport routes and drawing up a common approach to crisis situations . " we had a very good discussion which underlined that all member states agree that we need a coordinated joint energy policy , " said german chancellor angela merkel on her way into friday 's discussions . schüssel said thursday 's talks had set in motion the european union 's nascent energy policy and that it would be regularly reviewed over the next year . " be sure , 10 years from now , if you look back to what happened today , this was a very substantial debate leading to a total change of the energy policy in substance in the european union , " he added . protectio n ism dispute disputes over cross-border mergers and liberalization of the energy sector continued to reverberate around the summit , however . tensions had mounted in the run-up to the talks over bids by certain countries to protect their own national enterprises , in defiance of the principles of europe 's single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential takeover deal between e.on and endesa fueled the protectionism row a string of cases has underlined this , including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . tensions over the issue threatened to explode on the eve of the summit , when italy , deep in campaigning for elections in just over two weeks , sought support for a statement denouncing protectionism . but rome withdrew the proposed statement on the eve of the summit , and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , insisted there had been no bust-ups " it was an absolutely calm , substantial and positive debate .
nobody blamed the others , no fights , no turf wars , " he told reporters at a late-night press conference on thursday .
" it was a very good substantial debate . " the only real moment of discord came at the very start of the summit , when french president jacques chirac briefly walked out in protest when the head of europe 's employers group unice , a frenchman , delivered a speech - in english . k n owledge-based society as they have done for the last five years , eu leaders will also try to use the summit to push forward the so-called lisbon strategy aimed at transforming europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based society . so far their efforts seem to have borne little fruit . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.3 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .
computer players have a distinctive reality management and know exactly what is reality and what is play .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .
computer players have a distinctive reality management and know exactly what is reality and what is play .

but in brussels itself he kept a low profile , and few others were willing to stick their necks out . " there was not a confrontational debate , " said barroso . the eu commission chief was visibly satisfied to have won support for plans to forge a new joint energy strategy : notably by bolstering security of supplies , hooking up europe 's grids and better exploiting renewable energy sources . alarm bells sounded in eu capitals in january after europe was caught in the crossfire of a gas price war between russia and ukraine , leading to supply cuts which underlined the continent 's dependence on its giant eastern neighbor .

" we are on the right track in europe - trying to build europe on concrete results , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso at a closing press conference in brussels on friday . " the healthy thing about the debate is that , i think , it 's being won by those in favor of more open markets , " said british prime minister tony blair , adding : " the arguments are moving , in our view , in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , center , with polish leaders at the eu summit the traditional eu spring summit was focused firmly on breathing new life into the bloc 's so-called lisbon agenda , launched in the portuguese capital in 2000 to make europe the most competitive economy by the end of the decade . hope for calm agreement but the strategy has struggled to make any difference in concrete terms : while the united states and japan enjoy an economic resurgence , latest eu data put growth at a paltry 1.3 percent last year . eu leaders , still reeling from political earthquakes last year when the bloc 's first-ever constitution was rejected by french and dutch voters , had hoped the brussels summit would provide a chance for calm accord on economic strategy . energy deal amid protectionism row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german energy giant e.on had its eyes trained on spanish energy company endesa but in the run-up to the meeting , tension built over alleged protectionism in a string of cases including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . italy 's silvio berlusconi even tried to rally support for a joint statement denouncing protectionism on the eve of the summit .
but in brussels itself he kept a low profile , and few others were willing to stick their necks out . " there was not a confrontational debate , " said barroso . the eu commission chief was visibly satisfied to have won support for plans to forge a new joint energy strategy : notably by bolstering security of supplies , hooking up europe 's grids and better exploiting renewable energy sources . alarm bells sounded in eu capitals in january after europe was caught in the crossfire of a gas price war between russia and ukraine , leading to supply cuts which underlined the continent 's dependence on its giant eastern neighbor . " when we make the history of european integration we will say that energy policy was born on march 23-24 , 2006 , " said barroso .
" the conclusions are very , very important . " action against belarus another issue forced its way onto the summit agenda after new arrests in minsk following last week 's contested polls swept authoritarian president alexander lukashenko into a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko eu leaders agreed to implement new sanctions on the ex-soviet state , including on lukashenko himself . " the european council has decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards , including president lukashenko , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who currently holds the eu presidency , told reporters . she added that the freezing of assets was a possibility , but that economic sanctions were not discussed . chirac miffed by use of english but perhaps the most memorable moment in brussels was when french president chirac stormed out to protest a decision by fellow frenchman ernest-antoine seilliere , head of the european unice employers group , to speak english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president chirac does n't like the sound of english chirac explained that he had been " deeply shocked . "
but his protest raised many eyebrows in brussels , where english has increasingly overtaken the traditional dominance of the gallic tongue in the eu corridors of power . other european leaders shrugged off chirac 's attempt to defend french pride . " europe has other worries and it 's a waste of time to have to respond to such questions , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is usually a staunch francophile . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders move ahead on common energy policy european union leaders opened a second day of summit talks friday , downplaying discord over resurgent protectionism in the 25-nation bloc whilst trumpeting agreement on a new common energy policy .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe . " this would include developing common foreign and trade policy to support energy goals , new ways to diversify energy supplies and transport routes and drawing up a common approach to crisis situations . " we had a very good discussion which underlined that all member states agree that we need a coordinated joint energy policy , " said german chancellor angela merkel on her way into friday 's discussions . schüssel said thursday 's talks had set in motion the european union 's nascent energy policy and that it would be regularly reviewed over the next year . " be sure , 10 years from now , if you look back to what happened today , this was a very substantial debate leading to a total change of the energy policy in substance in the european union , " he added . protectio n ism dispute disputes over cross-border mergers and liberalization of the energy sector continued to reverberate around the summit , however . tensions had mounted in the run-up to the talks over bids by certain countries to protect their own national enterprises , in defiance of the principles of europe 's single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential takeover deal between e.on and endesa fueled the protectionism row a string of cases has underlined this , including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . tensions over the issue threatened to explode on the eve of the summit , when italy , deep in campaigning for elections in just over two weeks , sought support for a statement denouncing protectionism . but rome withdrew the proposed statement on the eve of the summit , and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , insisted there had been no bust-ups " it was an absolutely calm , substantial and positive debate .
nobody blamed the others , no fights , no turf wars , " he told reporters at a late-night press conference on thursday .
" it was a very good substantial debate . " the only real moment of discord came at the very start of the summit , when french president jacques chirac briefly walked out in protest when the head of europe 's employers group unice , a frenchman , delivered a speech - in english . k n owledge-based society as they have done for the last five years , eu leaders will also try to use the summit to push forward the so-called lisbon strategy aimed at transforming europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based society . so far their efforts seem to have borne little fruit . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.3 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time . " we realize that the respect that the americans have at this point in time is small , " arena said .

" now i know why i was n't invited to her funeral - it 's a mean-spirited intrigue on the part of my relatives , " jahn said . the distraught jahn has demanded that the local evangelical community responsible for the graveyard free her plot and bury the aunt elsewhere .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .

" if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to .

" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .

we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance .

currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe . " this would include developing common foreign and trade policy to support energy goals , new ways to diversify energy supplies and transport routes and drawing up a common approach to crisis situations . " we had a very good discussion which underlined that all member states agree that we need a coordinated joint energy policy , " said german chancellor angela merkel on her way into friday 's discussions . schüssel said thursday 's talks had set in motion the european union 's nascent energy policy and that it would be regularly reviewed over the next year . " be sure , 10 years from now , if you look back to what happened today , this was a very substantial debate leading to a total change of the energy policy in substance in the european union , " he added . protectio n ism dispute disputes over cross-border mergers and liberalization of the energy sector continued to reverberate around the summit , however . tensions had mounted in the run-up to the talks over bids by certain countries to protect their own national enterprises , in defiance of the principles of europe 's single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential takeover deal between e.on and endesa fueled the protectionism row a string of cases has underlined this , including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . tensions over the issue threatened to explode on the eve of the summit , when italy , deep in campaigning for elections in just over two weeks , sought support for a statement denouncing protectionism . but rome withdrew the proposed statement on the eve of the summit , and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , insisted there had been no bust-ups " it was an absolutely calm , substantial and positive debate .
nobody blamed the others , no fights , no turf wars , " he told reporters at a late-night press conference on thursday .
" it was a very good substantial debate . " the only real moment of discord came at the very start of the summit , when french president jacques chirac briefly walked out in protest when the head of europe 's employers group unice , a frenchman , delivered a speech - in english . k n owledge-based society as they have done for the last five years , eu leaders will also try to use the summit to push forward the so-called lisbon strategy aimed at transforming europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based society . so far their efforts seem to have borne little fruit . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.3 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .

" we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .

but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it .

a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .

" the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe . " this would include developing common foreign and trade policy to support energy goals , new ways to diversify energy supplies and transport routes and drawing up a common approach to crisis situations . " we had a very good discussion which underlined that all member states agree that we need a coordinated joint energy policy , " said german chancellor angela merkel on her way into friday 's discussions . schüssel said thursday 's talks had set in motion the european union 's nascent energy policy and that it would be regularly reviewed over the next year . " be sure , 10 years from now , if you look back to what happened today , this was a very substantial debate leading to a total change of the energy policy in substance in the european union , " he added . protectio n ism dispute disputes over cross-border mergers and liberalization of the energy sector continued to reverberate around the summit , however . tensions had mounted in the run-up to the talks over bids by certain countries to protect their own national enterprises , in defiance of the principles of europe 's single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential takeover deal between e.on and endesa fueled the protectionism row a string of cases has underlined this , including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . tensions over the issue threatened to explode on the eve of the summit , when italy , deep in campaigning for elections in just over two weeks , sought support for a statement denouncing protectionism . but rome withdrew the proposed statement on the eve of the summit , and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , insisted there had been no bust-ups " it was an absolutely calm , substantial and positive debate .
nobody blamed the others , no fights , no turf wars , " he told reporters at a late-night press conference on thursday .
" it was a very good substantial debate . " the only real moment of discord came at the very start of the summit , when french president jacques chirac briefly walked out in protest when the head of europe 's employers group unice , a frenchman , delivered a speech - in english . k n owledge-based society as they have done for the last five years , eu leaders will also try to use the summit to push forward the so-called lisbon strategy aimed at transforming europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based society . so far their efforts seem to have borne little fruit . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.3 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .

" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .

" polish diplomat detai n ed the dramatic raid came on the fourth consecutive night that opposition activists - mostly students - peacefully occupied their tent camp on the vast , icy central square . they had stood day and night in a protective human shield around their cluster of 35 tents , chanting slogans such as " freedom ! " and waving banners and flags , including that of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader alexander milinkevich outside the prison where protestors were taken among those detained in the police raid was a stepson of milinkevich .

" these authorities can only speak one language , that of repression .
they showed that again .
i had been expecting this each night . " it was not immediately clear whether the authorities would now allow the demonstration that milinkevich promises on saturday - or whether the opposition leader himself could face charges of organizing illegal protests . the opposition has received political backing from the european union and united states , where the white house considers lukashenko a " dictator .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time . " we realize that the respect that the americans have at this point in time is small , " arena said .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time . " we realize that the respect that the americans have at this point in time is small , " arena said .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

" i 'm running for the post of mayor and i will be the mayor of kiev , " a confident klitschko recently told cheering crowds . " young , successful people like him should lead the country , " pawel kolomojzew , a doctor watching one of klitschko 's campaign appearances told german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vitali klitschko is a huge celebrity in ukraine the 34-year-old is a towering figure in ukrainian public life and is hugely popular among most ukrainians . klitschko , who hung up his boxing gloves last november after a knee injury prevented him from holding a mandatory title defense fight against hasim rahman , has been courted furiously by political parties ever since . the pull of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko with the klitschko brothers in 2004 ukrainians first got an inkling of klitschko 's political leanings when he and brother wladimir regularly joined demonstrators during the so-called " orange revolution " in 2004/2005 in kiev and openly supported the then opposition leader and current president viktor yushchenko . last year , the boxing icon said he would also be interested in running for a parliamentary seat . ukraine will hold both parliamentary and regional elections on march 26 .
the parliamentary election will redraw the nation 's political landscape after constitutional changes which entered into this year transferred to the legislature important powers currently held by the president . klitschko heads a list of candidates from a bloc formed by two key players in the 2004 protests - the pora youth movement and the reform and order party . " if democratic forces unite , and i think -lrb- president -rrb- viktor yushchenko can accomplish this , i do n't exclude the possibility of my candidacy in the upper rada elections , " klitschko said during a press conference last year .
" i would be a candidate from a bloc of democratic forces . " no knock-out victory despite his immense popularity , klitschko 's victory in the mayoral election in kiev is far from certain .
current mayor alexander omelchenko , who has until now been a kind of political godfather to klitschko , is expected to put up a serious fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vitali klitschko is portraying a clean and honest image during the campaign klitschko has resorted to accusing omelchenko of responsibility for widespread corruption and has portrayed himself as an honest and untainted contender for the post .

" the european council has decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards , including president lukashenko , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who currently holds the eu presidency , told reporters . she added that the freezing of assets was a possibility , but that economic sanctions were not discussed . eu leaders co n dem n arrests of oppositio n supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaned away the tent camp after protestors had been arrested friday morning earlier in the day , plassnik had called on lukashenko 's government to free people that had been arrested as an opposition camp in minsk had been raided by police friday morning .
some 300-400 protestors were herded or carried into green trucks with barred windows .
there was no violence or resistance . " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik eu leaders arriving for the second day of the brussels summit widely condemned the crackdown and said that belarus 's giant neighbour and ally , russia , had to be engaged . " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia , " said swedish prime minister goran persson .
" we have to give all possible support to the democratic forces inside the country . " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said : " i think what happened last night is really very , very negative .
young people on the street , they have the right to protest , to make known their opinion about this regime . " " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is the most important , i think , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of belarussian opposition presidential candidate alexander milinkevich in minsk on tuesday the opposition protests began after lukashenko was swept back into power in sunday 's presidential election - a vote widely accepted as unfair and slammed by the eu this week . in washington , the us state department said it was " disturbed by the breakup of the demonstration and the detention of protestors . " polish diplomat detai n ed the dramatic raid came on the fourth consecutive night that opposition activists - mostly students - peacefully occupied their tent camp on the vast , icy central square . they had stood day and night in a protective human shield around their cluster of 35 tents , chanting slogans such as " freedom ! " and waving banners and flags , including that of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader alexander milinkevich outside the prison where protestors were taken among those detained in the police raid was a stepson of milinkevich .
also detained was a polish diplomat and former ambassador to minsk , mariusz maszkewicz , the polish consulate and witnesses said . " they are not giving any information , " poland 's consul , krzysztof swiderek , told afp outside the prison where the demonstrators were being held .
" they wo n't let us see him .
that 's a violation of the geneva convention . " the raid leaves belarus ' opposition in crisis .
already , more than 250 people had been arrested since sunday , according to human rights organizations . state television has been running hours of reports daily aimed at discrediting milinkevich and the demonstrators as western agents and social deviants . mili n kevich defia n t but milinkevich , who according to official results won only 6.1 percent of sunday 's vote , compared to 83 percent for lukashenko , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has cracked down on dissenters " we will continue with what we planned for -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " milinkevich told reporters .
" these authorities can only speak one language , that of repression .
they showed that again .
i had been expecting this each night . " it was not immediately clear whether the authorities would now allow the demonstration that milinkevich promises on saturday - or whether the opposition leader himself could face charges of organizing illegal protests . the opposition has received political backing from the european union and united states , where the white house considers lukashenko a " dictator . "

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hospital doctors call nationwide strike doctors at german university clinics and state hospitals voted by an overwhelming majority wednesday to begin a nationwide strike this week for better pay and working conditions .
-lrb- march 15 , 2006 -rrb- service sector strikes spread through german states germany 's biggest public sector strikes since the early 1990s spread when workers at the university hospital in frankfurt stopped work , making the state of hesse the 12th to join in with industrial action .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany .

" we are on the right track in europe - trying to build europe on concrete results , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso at a closing press conference in brussels on friday . " the healthy thing about the debate is that , i think , it 's being won by those in favor of more open markets , " said british prime minister tony blair , adding : " the arguments are moving , in our view , in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , center , with polish leaders at the eu summit the traditional eu spring summit was focused firmly on breathing new life into the bloc 's so-called lisbon agenda , launched in the portuguese capital in 2000 to make europe the most competitive economy by the end of the decade . hope for calm agreement but the strategy has struggled to make any difference in concrete terms : while the united states and japan enjoy an economic resurgence , latest eu data put growth at a paltry 1.3 percent last year . eu leaders , still reeling from political earthquakes last year when the bloc 's first-ever constitution was rejected by french and dutch voters , had hoped the brussels summit would provide a chance for calm accord on economic strategy . energy deal amid protectionism row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german energy giant e.on had its eyes trained on spanish energy company endesa but in the run-up to the meeting , tension built over alleged protectionism in a string of cases including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . italy 's silvio berlusconi even tried to rally support for a joint statement denouncing protectionism on the eve of the summit .
but in brussels itself he kept a low profile , and few others were willing to stick their necks out . " there was not a confrontational debate , " said barroso . the eu commission chief was visibly satisfied to have won support for plans to forge a new joint energy strategy : notably by bolstering security of supplies , hooking up europe 's grids and better exploiting renewable energy sources . alarm bells sounded in eu capitals in january after europe was caught in the crossfire of a gas price war between russia and ukraine , leading to supply cuts which underlined the continent 's dependence on its giant eastern neighbor . " when we make the history of european integration we will say that energy policy was born on march 23-24 , 2006 , " said barroso .
" the conclusions are very , very important . " action against belarus another issue forced its way onto the summit agenda after new arrests in minsk following last week 's contested polls swept authoritarian president alexander lukashenko into a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko eu leaders agreed to implement new sanctions on the ex-soviet state , including on lukashenko himself . " the european council has decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards , including president lukashenko , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who currently holds the eu presidency , told reporters . she added that the freezing of assets was a possibility , but that economic sanctions were not discussed . chirac miffed by use of english but perhaps the most memorable moment in brussels was when french president chirac stormed out to protest a decision by fellow frenchman ernest-antoine seilliere , head of the european unice employers group , to speak english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president chirac does n't like the sound of english chirac explained that he had been " deeply shocked . "
but his protest raised many eyebrows in brussels , where english has increasingly overtaken the traditional dominance of the gallic tongue in the eu corridors of power . other european leaders shrugged off chirac 's attempt to defend french pride . " europe has other worries and it 's a waste of time to have to respond to such questions , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is usually a staunch francophile . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders move ahead on common energy policy european union leaders opened a second day of summit talks friday , downplaying discord over resurgent protectionism in the 25-nation bloc whilst trumpeting agreement on a new common energy policy .

" the european council has decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards , including president lukashenko , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who currently holds the eu presidency , told reporters . she added that the freezing of assets was a possibility , but that economic sanctions were not discussed . eu leaders co n dem n arrests of oppositio n supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaned away the tent camp after protestors had been arrested friday morning earlier in the day , plassnik had called on lukashenko 's government to free people that had been arrested as an opposition camp in minsk had been raided by police friday morning .
some 300-400 protestors were herded or carried into green trucks with barred windows .
there was no violence or resistance . " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik eu leaders arriving for the second day of the brussels summit widely condemned the crackdown and said that belarus 's giant neighbour and ally , russia , had to be engaged . " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia , " said swedish prime minister goran persson .
" we have to give all possible support to the democratic forces inside the country . " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said : " i think what happened last night is really very , very negative .
young people on the street , they have the right to protest , to make known their opinion about this regime . " " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is the most important , i think , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of belarussian opposition presidential candidate alexander milinkevich in minsk on tuesday the opposition protests began after lukashenko was swept back into power in sunday 's presidential election - a vote widely accepted as unfair and slammed by the eu this week . in washington , the us state department said it was " disturbed by the breakup of the demonstration and the detention of protestors . " polish diplomat detai n ed the dramatic raid came on the fourth consecutive night that opposition activists - mostly students - peacefully occupied their tent camp on the vast , icy central square . they had stood day and night in a protective human shield around their cluster of 35 tents , chanting slogans such as " freedom ! " and waving banners and flags , including that of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader alexander milinkevich outside the prison where protestors were taken among those detained in the police raid was a stepson of milinkevich .
also detained was a polish diplomat and former ambassador to minsk , mariusz maszkewicz , the polish consulate and witnesses said . " they are not giving any information , " poland 's consul , krzysztof swiderek , told afp outside the prison where the demonstrators were being held .
" they wo n't let us see him .
that 's a violation of the geneva convention . " the raid leaves belarus ' opposition in crisis .
already , more than 250 people had been arrested since sunday , according to human rights organizations . state television has been running hours of reports daily aimed at discrediting milinkevich and the demonstrators as western agents and social deviants . mili n kevich defia n t but milinkevich , who according to official results won only 6.1 percent of sunday 's vote , compared to 83 percent for lukashenko , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has cracked down on dissenters " we will continue with what we planned for -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " milinkevich told reporters .
" these authorities can only speak one language , that of repression .
they showed that again .
i had been expecting this each night . " it was not immediately clear whether the authorities would now allow the demonstration that milinkevich promises on saturday - or whether the opposition leader himself could face charges of organizing illegal protests . the opposition has received political backing from the european union and united states , where the white house considers lukashenko a " dictator .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe . " this would include developing common foreign and trade policy to support energy goals , new ways to diversify energy supplies and transport routes and drawing up a common approach to crisis situations . " we had a very good discussion which underlined that all member states agree that we need a coordinated joint energy policy , " said german chancellor angela merkel on her way into friday 's discussions . schüssel said thursday 's talks had set in motion the european union 's nascent energy policy and that it would be regularly reviewed over the next year . " be sure , 10 years from now , if you look back to what happened today , this was a very substantial debate leading to a total change of the energy policy in substance in the european union , " he added . protectio n ism dispute disputes over cross-border mergers and liberalization of the energy sector continued to reverberate around the summit , however . tensions had mounted in the run-up to the talks over bids by certain countries to protect their own national enterprises , in defiance of the principles of europe 's single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential takeover deal between e.on and endesa fueled the protectionism row a string of cases has underlined this , including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . tensions over the issue threatened to explode on the eve of the summit , when italy , deep in campaigning for elections in just over two weeks , sought support for a statement denouncing protectionism . but rome withdrew the proposed statement on the eve of the summit , and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , insisted there had been no bust-ups " it was an absolutely calm , substantial and positive debate .
nobody blamed the others , no fights , no turf wars , " he told reporters at a late-night press conference on thursday .
" it was a very good substantial debate . " the only real moment of discord came at the very start of the summit , when french president jacques chirac briefly walked out in protest when the head of europe 's employers group unice , a frenchman , delivered a speech - in english . k n owledge-based society as they have done for the last five years , eu leaders will also try to use the summit to push forward the so-called lisbon strategy aimed at transforming europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based society . so far their efforts seem to have borne little fruit . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.3 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .

" the european council has decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards , including president lukashenko , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who currently holds the eu presidency , told reporters . she added that the freezing of assets was a possibility , but that economic sanctions were not discussed . eu leaders co n dem n arrests of oppositio n supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaned away the tent camp after protestors had been arrested friday morning earlier in the day , plassnik had called on lukashenko 's government to free people that had been arrested as an opposition camp in minsk had been raided by police friday morning .
some 300-400 protestors were herded or carried into green trucks with barred windows .
there was no violence or resistance . " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik eu leaders arriving for the second day of the brussels summit widely condemned the crackdown and said that belarus 's giant neighbour and ally , russia , had to be engaged . " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia , " said swedish prime minister goran persson .
" we have to give all possible support to the democratic forces inside the country . " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said : " i think what happened last night is really very , very negative .
young people on the street , they have the right to protest , to make known their opinion about this regime . " " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is the most important , i think , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of belarussian opposition presidential candidate alexander milinkevich in minsk on tuesday the opposition protests began after lukashenko was swept back into power in sunday 's presidential election - a vote widely accepted as unfair and slammed by the eu this week . in washington , the us state department said it was " disturbed by the breakup of the demonstration and the detention of protestors . " polish diplomat detai n ed the dramatic raid came on the fourth consecutive night that opposition activists - mostly students - peacefully occupied their tent camp on the vast , icy central square . they had stood day and night in a protective human shield around their cluster of 35 tents , chanting slogans such as " freedom ! " and waving banners and flags , including that of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader alexander milinkevich outside the prison where protestors were taken among those detained in the police raid was a stepson of milinkevich .
also detained was a polish diplomat and former ambassador to minsk , mariusz maszkewicz , the polish consulate and witnesses said . " they are not giving any information , " poland 's consul , krzysztof swiderek , told afp outside the prison where the demonstrators were being held .
" they wo n't let us see him .
that 's a violation of the geneva convention . " the raid leaves belarus ' opposition in crisis .
already , more than 250 people had been arrested since sunday , according to human rights organizations . state television has been running hours of reports daily aimed at discrediting milinkevich and the demonstrators as western agents and social deviants . mili n kevich defia n t but milinkevich , who according to official results won only 6.1 percent of sunday 's vote , compared to 83 percent for lukashenko , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has cracked down on dissenters " we will continue with what we planned for -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " milinkevich told reporters .
" these authorities can only speak one language , that of repression .
they showed that again .
i had been expecting this each night . " it was not immediately clear whether the authorities would now allow the demonstration that milinkevich promises on saturday - or whether the opposition leader himself could face charges of organizing illegal protests . the opposition has received political backing from the european union and united states , where the white house considers lukashenko a " dictator . "

the grave plot she had reserved for herself next to her late husband , hans , has already been taken - by hans ' aunt .
jahn only learned of the grave-robbing when she brought fresh flowers to lay at her husband 's headstone . " as i stood before the double grave , i thought my heart would explode , " the widow told the berlin tabloid , b.z.
" another person was lying in the place that was reserved for me ! " the aunt in question died in january . " now i know why i was n't invited to her funeral - it 's a mean-spirited intrigue on the part of my relatives , " jahn said . the distraught jahn has demanded that the local evangelical community responsible for the graveyard free her plot and bury the aunt elsewhere .
the graveyard 's administrators have turned down her request . family feud " i thought the family had made these arrangements , " said church spokeswoman anneliese gerlach .
" frau jahn 's daughter arranged her aunt 's funeral , and told me that her mother wished to be buried in an urn in her husband 's plot . " while the family will undoubtedly have plenty to discuss at their next reunion , jahn is not giving up her dispute with the church , and has engaged a legal team to reclaim her grave so that she may eventually rest in peace . " a grave is not the kind of property you trade or exchange , " she said .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .
computer players have a distinctive reality management and know exactly what is reality and what is play .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player . " if a player has mastered , for example , an episode in the game successfully , that increases his self-esteem , " he said .
" it is great fun to cause dependable and repeatable reactions with certain mouse clicks or keyboard orders " in contrast to the real world where such actions do not generate the same emotions . of course , failures in the game can also release the opposite emotions such as annoyance . " however , as a rule the manufacturers of the game insert more attainable goals than insoluble tasks , " klimmt said . blurri n g of reality a n d fa n tasy n ot credible , say scie n tists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite advanced graphics , people still know it 's a game the perceived danger that the distinction between reality and the gaming world can become blurred as technology makes virtual environments more lifelike is one not held by most scientists . " of course , there are many factors which work subliminal on the players and influence them unconsciously , " klimmt said .
" but not everyone who plays a ' killer ' game would be able to stand the stress of a real murder .

" young , successful people like him should lead the country , " pawel kolomojzew , a doctor watching one of klitschko 's campaign appearances told german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vitali klitschko is a huge celebrity in ukraine the 34-year-old is a towering figure in ukrainian public life and is hugely popular among most ukrainians . klitschko , who hung up his boxing gloves last november after a knee injury prevented him from holding a mandatory title defense fight against hasim rahman , has been courted furiously by political parties ever since . the pull of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko with the klitschko brothers in 2004 ukrainians first got an inkling of klitschko 's political leanings when he and brother wladimir regularly joined demonstrators during the so-called " orange revolution " in 2004/2005 in kiev and openly supported the then opposition leader and current president viktor yushchenko . last year , the boxing icon said he would also be interested in running for a parliamentary seat . ukraine will hold both parliamentary and regional elections on march 26 .
the parliamentary election will redraw the nation 's political landscape after constitutional changes which entered into this year transferred to the legislature important powers currently held by the president . klitschko heads a list of candidates from a bloc formed by two key players in the 2004 protests - the pora youth movement and the reform and order party . " if democratic forces unite , and i think -lrb- president -rrb- viktor yushchenko can accomplish this , i do n't exclude the possibility of my candidacy in the upper rada elections , " klitschko said during a press conference last year .
" i would be a candidate from a bloc of democratic forces . " no knock-out victory despite his immense popularity , klitschko 's victory in the mayoral election in kiev is far from certain .
current mayor alexander omelchenko , who has until now been a kind of political godfather to klitschko , is expected to put up a serious fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vitali klitschko is portraying a clean and honest image during the campaign klitschko has resorted to accusing omelchenko of responsibility for widespread corruption and has portrayed himself as an honest and untainted contender for the post . " corruption in the kiev administration has reached top levels , " klitschko said recently , adding that he wanted to transform kiev into " the most pleasant city in central and eastern europe . "
last year klitschko told a press conference : " i want to become kiev mayor because i love my city very much and want to improve life in it . " but despite the allegations of corruption , there 's no denying that the three-million strong capital has developed vastly under omelchenko 's leadership .
even during the orange revolution , the kiev mayor lent his support to the demonstrators by allowing them to use administrative buildings to seek refuge from the freezing cold . omelchenko is also currently leading in opinions polls at 36 percent , while klitschko 's support is at 15 percent . sports and then politics klitschko is n't the first sports icon in ukraine to turn to politics . two-time olympics winner in sprinting valeri borzov was ukraine 's sports minister in the early 1990s , and the current national soccer coach , oleg blochin , has a second job in the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladimir klitschko is going to stick to what he does best vitali klitschko 's younger brother , wladimir , is clear that politics is n't his thing .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe . " this would include developing common foreign and trade policy to support energy goals , new ways to diversify energy supplies and transport routes and drawing up a common approach to crisis situations . " we had a very good discussion which underlined that all member states agree that we need a coordinated joint energy policy , " said german chancellor angela merkel on her way into friday 's discussions . schüssel said thursday 's talks had set in motion the european union 's nascent energy policy and that it would be regularly reviewed over the next year . " be sure , 10 years from now , if you look back to what happened today , this was a very substantial debate leading to a total change of the energy policy in substance in the european union , " he added . protectio n ism dispute disputes over cross-border mergers and liberalization of the energy sector continued to reverberate around the summit , however . tensions had mounted in the run-up to the talks over bids by certain countries to protect their own national enterprises , in defiance of the principles of europe 's single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential takeover deal between e.on and endesa fueled the protectionism row a string of cases has underlined this , including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . tensions over the issue threatened to explode on the eve of the summit , when italy , deep in campaigning for elections in just over two weeks , sought support for a statement denouncing protectionism . but rome withdrew the proposed statement on the eve of the summit , and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , insisted there had been no bust-ups " it was an absolutely calm , substantial and positive debate .
nobody blamed the others , no fights , no turf wars , " he told reporters at a late-night press conference on thursday .
" it was a very good substantial debate . " the only real moment of discord came at the very start of the summit , when french president jacques chirac briefly walked out in protest when the head of europe 's employers group unice , a frenchman , delivered a speech - in english . k n owledge-based society as they have done for the last five years , eu leaders will also try to use the summit to push forward the so-called lisbon strategy aimed at transforming europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based society . so far their efforts seem to have borne little fruit . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.3 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time . " we realize that the respect that the americans have at this point in time is small , " arena said .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time . " we realize that the respect that the americans have at this point in time is small , " arena said .
" everything we earn , we have to earn on the field and that 's fair enough .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

" the european leaders agreed to promote competitiveness , coherence , solidarity and sustainability , " he said . barroso was vague about details , due to be made public later on friday , but a draft copy of the accord said the commission would be asked to draw up an " energy policy for europe . " this would include developing common foreign and trade policy to support energy goals , new ways to diversify energy supplies and transport routes and drawing up a common approach to crisis situations . " we had a very good discussion which underlined that all member states agree that we need a coordinated joint energy policy , " said german chancellor angela merkel on her way into friday 's discussions . schüssel said thursday 's talks had set in motion the european union 's nascent energy policy and that it would be regularly reviewed over the next year . " be sure , 10 years from now , if you look back to what happened today , this was a very substantial debate leading to a total change of the energy policy in substance in the european union , " he added . protectio n ism dispute disputes over cross-border mergers and liberalization of the energy sector continued to reverberate around the summit , however . tensions had mounted in the run-up to the talks over bids by certain countries to protect their own national enterprises , in defiance of the principles of europe 's single market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential takeover deal between e.on and endesa fueled the protectionism row a string of cases has underlined this , including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . tensions over the issue threatened to explode on the eve of the summit , when italy , deep in campaigning for elections in just over two weeks , sought support for a statement denouncing protectionism . but rome withdrew the proposed statement on the eve of the summit , and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , insisted there had been no bust-ups " it was an absolutely calm , substantial and positive debate .
nobody blamed the others , no fights , no turf wars , " he told reporters at a late-night press conference on thursday .
" it was a very good substantial debate . " the only real moment of discord came at the very start of the summit , when french president jacques chirac briefly walked out in protest when the head of europe 's employers group unice , a frenchman , delivered a speech - in english . k n owledge-based society as they have done for the last five years , eu leaders will also try to use the summit to push forward the so-called lisbon strategy aimed at transforming europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based society . so far their efforts seem to have borne little fruit . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.3 percent . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .

" of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to .

but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .

can the country afford to pay its doctors more - and can it afford not to ? on wednesday afternoon , several dozen physicians stood outside the university hospital of cologne , cleaning the windows of stopped cars . the action was meant to show that they are treated more like menial labor than highly trained professionals . doctors across germany went on strike after the state tariff association , which represents university hospital employers , sought to increase the official working week to 42 hours from 38.5 .
but the physicians ' union , the marburger bund , argued this would mean a pay decrease in real terms .
they demanded a 30 percent wage increase in turn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' say ' aaah ' - or let me clean your windshield ' .
mds in cologne got creative for publicity negotiations reached an impasse last week , leading to preliminary strikes that have since grown .
altogether , more than 20,000 m.d.s have stopped work across the country in staggered protest strikes -lrb- only non-urgent medical services have been affected so far . -rrb-
on wednesday , more than 5,000 white-coated doctors turned up for a massive protest march in hanover . offer ' too bad to take ' according to rudolf henke , vice chairman of the marbuger bund , accepting the 42 hour-week would mean a real loss to physicians of up to 15 percent of their earnings . " we know in the end we have to negotiate -lrb- over the 30 percent wage increase demand , -rrb- but i have to say , the employers ’ offer to date is just too bad to accept , " henke said . exploratory talks thursday had failed to bring about a deal , but both sides agreed to further negotiations next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 showed up for a demonstration in hanover on wednesday the m.d.s also argue that most hospital physicians work way more than 42 hours each week already - hours they aren ’ t compensated for .
and they complain they are underpaid for on-call shifts , and have steadily lost holiday pay . " the general public people think doctors earn really well .
but when it comes to hospital doctors , that ’ s not the case , " said roland teufer , head of anaesthesiology at the community hospital of traunstein in southern germany .
" clinic doctors generally work a lot of overtime hours , well more than 38.5 hours , and they aren ’ t paid for it . " germany : lowest wages indeed , a 2004 study by uk economic research group nera showed german hospital physicians at the rock bottom of a list of 11 western countries in terms of compensation , earning between 35,000 and 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 41,000 to $ 77,000 -rrb- per year .
a similar oecd study showed german physicians earning 15 percent less than their counterparts in the uk , and 40 percent less than us doctors . ulrich rieger , president of the state tariff association , tdl , says the situation isn ’ t as bad as it looks .
he claims the income earned through billing privately insured patients actually boosts the pay of many hospital doctors .
-lrb- doctors reply that this used to be true , but is no longer the case due to changes in insurance and billing . -rrb- service-based pay ? meanwhile , rieger and tdl are proposing a pay system that would reward doctors with better results .
" in this system , a doctor who consistently performs a successful operation in two hours would earn more than one who did the same operation in five hours , " said rieger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they would like better pay and better hours marburger bund ’ s henke said he is not opposed to rewarding certain excellent doctors , but pointed out that such a plan does not address the overall pay disparity issue . besides , he asks : " how do you determine what constitutes a good service ?
is a good service sitting for a half hour by the bedside of someone who just got a bad cancer diagnosis , or is it doing three ultrasound scans in the same time ? " the physicians ' strikes are taking place against a backdrop of widespread labor unrest in germany : trash collectors , nurses , maintenance workers and other public servants have been on strike for seven weeks . so is it hard for the public to feel sympathy with physicians , who are generally seen as a cadre of economic elites ? perhaps , henke said .
but he added : " we don ’ t want social pity .
it 's just that physicians have jobs that are very responsible , difficult , and sometimes dangerous .
they require constant advanced training and further eductation , a very very long education period , and that all needs to be fairly compensated . " long-time problem the problem with physicians ' pay is not recent .
" it has been a political problem for the past 20 years , but it 's been ignored , " henke said . up to the end of the 1990s , a glut of doctors meant the oversupply of labor made it possible for employers to get sweet deals .
today , however , there is a physician shortage .
now , the relatively poor pay and difficult conditions have led to a mini-exodus of doctors fleeing germany for the uk , scandinavia and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf henke , vice president of the marbuger bund " in my opinion , germany 's low-qualification jobs are overpaid , so those jobs are going overseas , " said henke .
" at the same time , our qualified people earn far too little .
that leads to a brain drain of all professionals ...
but for physicians it is particularly extreme , because of the capped budgets at state hospitals . " the budgets are the problem , of course : while hospital physicians may well deserve more money , there are those who point out that in its current ecnomic doldrums , germany has no extra money to throw around . demand called ' unrealistic ' the doctors ' cause was recently dealt a pr blow when german health minister ulla schmidt publicly called their 30 percent pay hike demand " unrealistic " and said the parties should sit down and find a solution , fast . traunstein clinic 's teufer pointed out that in places where doctors earn more , the care is either much more expensive , or less extensive , than in germany . " the countries that pay their doctors more often have more restrictions on benefits .
patients have to wait longer for treatment - in holland you can wait six months for a hip replacement , and here you get it in four to six weeks , " he said . " germany still tries to provide a lot of its medicine via the state - and makes it immediately available .
that costs a lot , and we don ’ t have a lot of money available .
it is done at the expense of the doctors .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time . " we realize that the respect that the americans have at this point in time is small , " arena said .
" everything we earn , we have to earn on the field and that 's fair enough .

" now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time . " we realize that the respect that the americans have at this point in time is small , " arena said .
" everything we earn , we have to earn on the field and that 's fair enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.03.2006 scientists debate violent influence at gaming conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say players can distinguish between a man-eating monster and reality according to some , violent computer games are the scourge of society , the corrupters of the young and should be banned .
but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement . the games " doom " and " counter strike " are the biggest names in a debate that has been raging ever since the simplicity of the " pong " tennis game made way for gory shoot- ' em-ups .
it is debate that has also stirred experts at the " clash of realities " international computer game conference in cologne , which ends friday . do violent computer games really turn players into gun-toting maniacs ?
critics say the evidence is overwhelming .
one quoted example in germany stands out above all others .
the school massacre in erfurt in 2002 was blamed on the shooter 's passionate addiction to the military assassin game " counter strike . " however , researchers into the debated phenomena believe that it would take a long period of playing violent video games before it had any effect on a person ’ s psyche of personality . " of course it is easy to make connections between a person running amok and their regular playing of so-called ' killer ' games , " said tilo hartmann , a researcher at the university of southern california .
hartmann is skeptical about whether there is actual substance behind these connections . aggressive n ess does i n crease but margi n ally i n a short time studies into the effect of video games has shown that there is a minimal increase in aggressiveness and hostile behavior after a period of about 20 to 30 minutes of playing but researchers say that watching violent movies possibly have more of an impact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in-depth research could last years and cost millions what is missing , hartmann said , is hard scientific data on the longer effects of playing violent games as a lab test of over 45 minutes under scientific conditions is very costly .
a study which would produce the necessary results would last three to four years .
currently the longest study in germany lasted only one year . hartmann also said he believes that scientific testing must be backed up with a psychological profile of the player . " it would be absolutely stupid to suppose that computer games alone cause outbreaks of aggression , " he said .
" one must always question what happens in the person 's life and what other media they have access to . " i n here n t perso n ality traits lead to viole n ce it is a popular belief amongst researchers that players who exhibit violent behavior already have that potential in their personality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragile personalities are most at risk " there are certain risk groups , for example children from broken homes , " he said .
" or players who are repeatedly confronted with violence .
the behavior has a very complicated effect structure , and we are now only beginning to scratch the surface .
we must find out even more and then start going into depth . " according to christoph klimmt , a scientist at the institute of journalism and communications research at hanover 's college for music and theater , computer games can also have positive effects . at the moment , he investigates how games release the sense of fun in a player .

" i 'm running for the post of mayor and i will be the mayor of kiev , " a confident klitschko recently told cheering crowds . " young , successful people like him should lead the country , " pawel kolomojzew , a doctor watching one of klitschko 's campaign appearances told german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vitali klitschko is a huge celebrity in ukraine the 34-year-old is a towering figure in ukrainian public life and is hugely popular among most ukrainians . klitschko , who hung up his boxing gloves last november after a knee injury prevented him from holding a mandatory title defense fight against hasim rahman , has been courted furiously by political parties ever since . the pull of politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko with the klitschko brothers in 2004 ukrainians first got an inkling of klitschko 's political leanings when he and brother wladimir regularly joined demonstrators during the so-called " orange revolution " in 2004/2005 in kiev and openly supported the then opposition leader and current president viktor yushchenko . last year , the boxing icon said he would also be interested in running for a parliamentary seat . ukraine will hold both parliamentary and regional elections on march 26 .
the parliamentary election will redraw the nation 's political landscape after constitutional changes which entered into this year transferred to the legislature important powers currently held by the president . klitschko heads a list of candidates from a bloc formed by two key players in the 2004 protests - the pora youth movement and the reform and order party . " if democratic forces unite , and i think -lrb- president -rrb- viktor yushchenko can accomplish this , i do n't exclude the possibility of my candidacy in the upper rada elections , " klitschko said during a press conference last year .
" i would be a candidate from a bloc of democratic forces . " no knock-out victory despite his immense popularity , klitschko 's victory in the mayoral election in kiev is far from certain .
current mayor alexander omelchenko , who has until now been a kind of political godfather to klitschko , is expected to put up a serious fight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vitali klitschko is portraying a clean and honest image during the campaign klitschko has resorted to accusing omelchenko of responsibility for widespread corruption and has portrayed himself as an honest and untainted contender for the post . " corruption in the kiev administration has reached top levels , " klitschko said recently , adding that he wanted to transform kiev into " the most pleasant city in central and eastern europe . "
last year klitschko told a press conference : " i want to become kiev mayor because i love my city very much and want to improve life in it . " but despite the allegations of corruption , there 's no denying that the three-million strong capital has developed vastly under omelchenko 's leadership .
even during the orange revolution , the kiev mayor lent his support to the demonstrators by allowing them to use administrative buildings to seek refuge from the freezing cold . omelchenko is also currently leading in opinions polls at 36 percent , while klitschko 's support is at 15 percent . sports and then politics klitschko is n't the first sports icon in ukraine to turn to politics . two-time olympics winner in sprinting valeri borzov was ukraine 's sports minister in the early 1990s , and the current national soccer coach , oleg blochin , has a second job in the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladimir klitschko is going to stick to what he does best vitali klitschko 's younger brother , wladimir , is clear that politics is n't his thing .
instead , he 's going to take on american boxer chris byrd for the world boxing title on april 22 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer : keep ukraine on path to europe speaking in kiev on monday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the door to europe must remain open for ukraine , and urged leaders not to be influenced by the ongoing visa scandal in which he 's been implicated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2006 eu trumpets energy deal , plays down discord großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu joint energy strategy includes bolstering security of supplies european union leaders hailed an agreement on a new joint energy strategy friday and played down discord on resurgent protectionism , but a sense of unity was palpably missing . " we are on the right track in europe - trying to build europe on concrete results , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso at a closing press conference in brussels on friday . " the healthy thing about the debate is that , i think , it 's being won by those in favor of more open markets , " said british prime minister tony blair , adding : " the arguments are moving , in our view , in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , center , with polish leaders at the eu summit the traditional eu spring summit was focused firmly on breathing new life into the bloc 's so-called lisbon agenda , launched in the portuguese capital in 2000 to make europe the most competitive economy by the end of the decade . hope for calm agreement but the strategy has struggled to make any difference in concrete terms : while the united states and japan enjoy an economic resurgence , latest eu data put growth at a paltry 1.3 percent last year . eu leaders , still reeling from political earthquakes last year when the bloc 's first-ever constitution was rejected by french and dutch voters , had hoped the brussels summit would provide a chance for calm accord on economic strategy . energy deal amid protectionism row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german energy giant e.on had its eyes trained on spanish energy company endesa but in the run-up to the meeting , tension built over alleged protectionism in a string of cases including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . italy 's silvio berlusconi even tried to rally support for a joint statement denouncing protectionism on the eve of the summit .
but in brussels itself he kept a low profile , and few others were willing to stick their necks out . " there was not a confrontational debate , " said barroso . the eu commission chief was visibly satisfied to have won support for plans to forge a new joint energy strategy : notably by bolstering security of supplies , hooking up europe 's grids and better exploiting renewable energy sources . alarm bells sounded in eu capitals in january after europe was caught in the crossfire of a gas price war between russia and ukraine , leading to supply cuts which underlined the continent 's dependence on its giant eastern neighbor . " when we make the history of european integration we will say that energy policy was born on march 23-24 , 2006 , " said barroso .
" the conclusions are very , very important . " action against belarus another issue forced its way onto the summit agenda after new arrests in minsk following last week 's contested polls swept authoritarian president alexander lukashenko into a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko eu leaders agreed to implement new sanctions on the ex-soviet state , including on lukashenko himself . " the european council has decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards , including president lukashenko , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who currently holds the eu presidency , told reporters . she added that the freezing of assets was a possibility , but that economic sanctions were not discussed . chirac miffed by use of english but perhaps the most memorable moment in brussels was when french president chirac stormed out to protest a decision by fellow frenchman ernest-antoine seilliere , head of the european unice employers group , to speak english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president chirac does n't like the sound of english chirac explained that he had been " deeply shocked . "
but his protest raised many eyebrows in brussels , where english has increasingly overtaken the traditional dominance of the gallic tongue in the eu corridors of power . other european leaders shrugged off chirac 's attempt to defend french pride . " europe has other worries and it 's a waste of time to have to respond to such questions , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is usually a staunch francophile . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders move ahead on common energy policy european union leaders opened a second day of summit talks friday , downplaying discord over resurgent protectionism in the 25-nation bloc whilst trumpeting agreement on a new common energy policy .
-lrb- march 24 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .
but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- eu makes move toward unified energy policy heightened concerns after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine in january are forcing eu leaders to reexamine the bloc 's approach to its energy needs .

"
a german woman is threatening her local church with legal action after a family feud resulted in her aunt-in-law being buried in the grave plot she had reserved for herself , next to her husband . the tranquility of the evangelical graveyard in the town of boossen , eastern germany , has been disrupted ever since resident christa jahn , 73 , made a shocking discovery .
the grave plot she had reserved for herself next to her late husband , hans , has already been taken - by hans ' aunt .
jahn only learned of the grave-robbing when she brought fresh flowers to lay at her husband 's headstone . " as i stood before the double grave , i thought my heart would explode , " the widow told the berlin tabloid , b.z.
" another person was lying in the place that was reserved for me ! " the aunt in question died in january . " now i know why i was n't invited to her funeral - it 's a mean-spirited intrigue on the part of my relatives , " jahn said . the distraught jahn has demanded that the local evangelical community responsible for the graveyard free her plot and bury the aunt elsewhere .
the graveyard 's administrators have turned down her request . family feud " i thought the family had made these arrangements , " said church spokeswoman anneliese gerlach .
" frau jahn 's daughter arranged her aunt 's funeral , and told me that her mother wished to be buried in an urn in her husband 's plot . " while the family will undoubtedly have plenty to discuss at their next reunion , jahn is not giving up her dispute with the church , and has engaged a legal team to reclaim her grave so that she may eventually rest in peace .

" we are on the right track in europe - trying to build europe on concrete results , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso at a closing press conference in brussels on friday . " the healthy thing about the debate is that , i think , it 's being won by those in favor of more open markets , " said british prime minister tony blair , adding : " the arguments are moving , in our view , in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel , center , with polish leaders at the eu summit the traditional eu spring summit was focused firmly on breathing new life into the bloc 's so-called lisbon agenda , launched in the portuguese capital in 2000 to make europe the most competitive economy by the end of the decade . hope for calm agreement but the strategy has struggled to make any difference in concrete terms : while the united states and japan enjoy an economic resurgence , latest eu data put growth at a paltry 1.3 percent last year . eu leaders , still reeling from political earthquakes last year when the bloc 's first-ever constitution was rejected by french and dutch voters , had hoped the brussels summit would provide a chance for calm accord on economic strategy . energy deal amid protectionism row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german energy giant e.on had its eyes trained on spanish energy company endesa but in the run-up to the meeting , tension built over alleged protectionism in a string of cases including spanish efforts to block german energy giant e.on 's hostile takeover bid for endesa , and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel . italy 's silvio berlusconi even tried to rally support for a joint statement denouncing protectionism on the eve of the summit .
but in brussels itself he kept a low profile , and few others were willing to stick their necks out . " there was not a confrontational debate , " said barroso . the eu commission chief was visibly satisfied to have won support for plans to forge a new joint energy strategy : notably by bolstering security of supplies , hooking up europe 's grids and better exploiting renewable energy sources . alarm bells sounded in eu capitals in january after europe was caught in the crossfire of a gas price war between russia and ukraine , leading to supply cuts which underlined the continent 's dependence on its giant eastern neighbor . " when we make the history of european integration we will say that energy policy was born on march 23-24 , 2006 , " said barroso .
" the conclusions are very , very important . " action against belarus another issue forced its way onto the summit agenda after new arrests in minsk following last week 's contested polls swept authoritarian president alexander lukashenko into a third term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newly re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko eu leaders agreed to implement new sanctions on the ex-soviet state , including on lukashenko himself . " the european council has decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards , including president lukashenko , " austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , who currently holds the eu presidency , told reporters . she added that the freezing of assets was a possibility , but that economic sanctions were not discussed . chirac miffed by use of english but perhaps the most memorable moment in brussels was when french president chirac stormed out to protest a decision by fellow frenchman ernest-antoine seilliere , head of the european unice employers group , to speak english . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president chirac does n't like the sound of english chirac explained that he had been " deeply shocked . "
but his protest raised many eyebrows in brussels , where english has increasingly overtaken the traditional dominance of the gallic tongue in the eu corridors of power . other european leaders shrugged off chirac 's attempt to defend french pride . " europe has other worries and it 's a waste of time to have to respond to such questions , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is usually a staunch francophile . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders move ahead on common energy policy european union leaders opened a second day of summit talks friday , downplaying discord over resurgent protectionism in the 25-nation bloc whilst trumpeting agreement on a new common energy policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 24.03.2006 bundesliga holds valuable lessons for us players großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans such as goalie kasey keller are still an exception in the german league even after the us team 's 4-1 loss against germany in a soccer friendly wednesday , many americans will continue gaining experience they would n't be able to get at home by chasing germans across the bundesliga 's fields . after the routing of the us team , german national team coach jürgen klinsmann seemed to revel in his chance to shoot back at members of the media who spent three weeks attacking him after germany 's 4-1 loss to italy at the beginning of the month . " now we know where the enemy within is , " he said after the game wednesday .
" this win will allow us to carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere . " while us coach bruce arena admitted he would n't want the kind of obsessive attention klinsmann deals with to follow him back to the united states , he acknowledged that the pressure european teams face , even at club level in the german league or bundesliga and other european leagues , helps american players there develop faster than they could at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce arena said the us leagues does still create some top-quality players nothing like european experience " when you play on a regular basis in top european competition , you improve at a greater rate than you do in our domestic league - there 's no secret about it , " arena said .
" the games are more meaningful , more purposeful . " of the pool of about 70 players available to arena to choose for his world cup roster , nine play in england , four in germany , three in holland two in norway while belgium and denmark both have one us player each . bundesliga experience has helped national team members including goalkeeper kasey keller , who plays for mönchengladbach ; gregg berhalter of energie cottbus and hanover 96 's steve cherundolo solidify their spots on the us roster . " i was n't certain how he was going to do , but i can see differences in steve between now and 2001 when he first came to us , " arena said of cherundolo .
" he is a much more experienced player and he is a very good player , and if he remains healthy , there 's no reason to believe that he wo n't be in our first 11 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve cherundolo plays for hanover 96 americans need to earn their place cherundolo , hanover 's deputy captain , said playing for a german team is n't just a matter of strolling onto the field and taking over . " the mentality here is difficult , and i think they try to beat you down and build you up in their own way , with their own set of rules , " he said , adding that playing in germany was an opportunity he would n't turn down . playing in germany also keeps soccer from becoming a routine , according to keller . " it has helped maintain my levels of motivation , " he said in a fifa interview .
" you 're thinking , ' this is fresh , this is not something i have done before ' . " despite fifa recently ranking the us the fifth best team in the world - germany came in at 22 - american players are n't receiving any handouts when it comes to club playing time .

the spar shop in caerleon road has been told by newport community safety partnership -lrb- ncsp -rrb- not to use it .
the device , called a mosquito , works by emitting a high pitched irritating noise audible only to young people .
the ncsp says it is " indiscriminate " and can be heard by all youngsters , not just anti-social gangs of youths .
a spokesman for the ncsp said : " we have a responsibility to the human rights and health and safety of the whole community to consider before approving the device or investing in more of them .
" our issue with the device is that it is indiscriminate .

the ncsp said it had to be silenced until human rights and health and safety issues were " fully resolved " .
but the managers of the spar shop criticised the decision saying the £ 495 device made by a merthyr tydfil company has helped stop gangs of anti-social youths hanging outside the shop .
they say in the first three months of its installation , there was an 84 % reduction in the number of police call outs to the shop .
" it 's absolutely disgusting .

the noise from the device annoys young people " it makes me so very sad .
the device was working very well and now it 's been turned off - and we wo n't be surprised if the troublemakers return . "
the merthyr based manufacturer compound security ltd insisted the device does not breach the human rights of young people who can hear it .
marketing director simon morris said : " the noise has been tested extensively on dogs and cats who are totally unaffected by it .
" the device has a small range and it takes at least 10 minutes for the annoying nature of the noise to take effect .
" people have a right to assemble with others in a peaceful way - without violence or threat of violence .

but somehow the days leading up to 24 march 2006 - 30 years since the military came to power in argentina - have captured the public attention like no other .
books have been written , plays performed and debates conducted .
there are art exhibitions all over the country , plaques are being unveiled to commemorate the victims .
thousands will run in ten and three kilometre races on sunday in memory of miguel sanchez , himself a runner and just one of the 30,000 killed during military rule between 1976 and 1983 .
daniel acosta was a young art student in the city of la plata when in 1977 agents working for the state abducted him , a hood over his head .
he spent the next five years in prison and was often tortured .
he was labelled a subversive .
he drew while in prison to help come to terms with a situation that made no sense .
some of those works are on display at the recoleta cultural centre in buenos aires as part of an exhibition to mark the anniversary .
newspaper cuttings , telling stories of bomb attacks , dead bodies found on the street and political turmoil , line the walls .
one painting is of the waters of the river plate where bodies , some still alive , were dumped from military planes . "
people are leaving behind the fear " artist daniel acosta another is a study of the ford falcon , an argentine-made car that has become a symbol of the repression since it was these vehicles , with darkened windows and licence plates removed , that were used to abduct victims in the middle of the night .
one of daniel acosta 's works - of two shoes left behind when agents came to collect him in the night - has the word " censored " stamped in one corner .
he says that this anniversary feels different from previous ones because the victims and argentine society have put some distance between themselves and the horror of the military rule .
" people are leaving behind the fear , " he says .
" we can have a calmer look at the subject .
that does n't mean forgetting or pardoning but more justice and more truth . "
' hard to believe ' the book , nunca mas - never again , a report by argentina 's national commission on disappeared people , was first published in 1984 , just a year after the return to democracy .
it is a study of repression , detailing who was kidnapped , how they were taken and the torture they suffered .
it begins with the words : " many of the events described in this report will be hard to believe .
this is because the men and women of our nation have only heard of such horror in reports from distant places . "
that book is being re-published to mark the anniversary with new testimonies and new information that has come to light as investigators and victims ' families continue trying to understand the nightmare that befell what they thought was a modern , civilised country .
the report focuses on more than 9,000 victims - the disappeared - people who were taken in the night and their bodies never found .
human rights investigators say the true figure is closer to 30,000 .
alongside , not against the most prominent of those who refused to give up the search for justice are the mothers of the plaza de mayo .
when no-one would listen to them , they marched , silently outside the government palace in buenos aires every thursday afternoon , demanding to know what happened to their sons and daughters .
they march to this day .
they have in the past suffered death threats and constant abuse .
while their work continues , they find themselves now operating in a very different environment , alongside the government of president nestor kirchner , rather than against it .
they recently stopped their annual 24-hour march of resistance , designed to get the authorities to listen to their demands , because they said they were being heard .
the mothers were the catalyst for other groups such as the grandmothers of the plaza de mayo .
they search for the children who were taken as babies from prisoners and given for adoption to military or police couples .
those babies ' mothers were usually killed .
the grandmothers have found more than 80 such children so far and their work also continues .
after the return to democracy in 1983 , some of the perpetrators of some of those crimes were tried and sentenced .
but subsequently the governments of , firstly , raul alfonsin and then carlos menem pardoned the military leaders responsible for the terror .
they talked about moving on , putting the past behind them .
but the argentine people have not done that .
a recent campaign in the continued fight for justice is the " escrache " - a popular denunciation of alleged human rights violators .
last week , several thousand people turned up outside the apartment block where the former military leader , jorge rafael videla , lives .
they shouted " murderer " and threw red paint at the building .
he may never be brought to justice but the protesters are determined that his retirement , at the very least , will not be a comfortable one .
national holiday as well as the continuing search for justice , this has also been a time to remember the dead . "
it is only democracy which can save a people from horror on this scale " writer ernesto sabato a plaque has been unveiled in the plaza san martin , in the centre of buenos aires , naming the victims from argentina 's religious communities .
roman catholics , protestants , jews and muslims joined together to sing the national anthem and then heard the names of the victims read out .
the argentine military are firmly back in their barracks and some , humbled by the shame of the repression , have apologised for their actions in those dark years .
after a debate in congress last week , 24 march was declared a national holiday .
it will not be a celebration but a day of reflection .
in his prologue to the report nunca mas , the argentine writer ernesto sabato said : " it is only democracy which can save a people from horror on this scale . "
" only with democracy , will we be certain that never again will events such as these , which have made argentina so sadly infamous throughout the world , be repeated in our nation . "
argentina is still a nation coming to terms with its past .
but with each anniversary of the military coming to power , the confidence that it will not return to that nightmare is growing .

but somehow the days leading up to 24 march 2006 - 30 years since the military came to power in argentina - have captured the public attention like no other .
books have been written , plays performed and debates conducted .
there are art exhibitions all over the country , plaques are being unveiled to commemorate the victims .
thousands will run in ten and three kilometre races on sunday in memory of miguel sanchez , himself a runner and just one of the 30,000 killed during military rule between 1976 and 1983 .
daniel acosta was a young art student in the city of la plata when in 1977 agents working for the state abducted him , a hood over his head .
he spent the next five years in prison and was often tortured .
he was labelled a subversive .
he drew while in prison to help come to terms with a situation that made no sense .
some of those works are on display at the recoleta cultural centre in buenos aires as part of an exhibition to mark the anniversary .
newspaper cuttings , telling stories of bomb attacks , dead bodies found on the street and political turmoil , line the walls .
one painting is of the waters of the river plate where bodies , some still alive , were dumped from military planes .
people are leaving behind the fear artist daniel acosta another is a study of the ford falcon , an argentine-made car that has become a symbol of the repression since it was these vehicles , with darkened windows and licence plates removed , that were used to abduct victims in the middle of the night .
one of daniel acosta 's works - of two shoes left behind when agents came to collect him in the night - has the word " censored " stamped in one corner .
he says that this anniversary feels different from previous ones because the victims and argentine society have put some distance between themselves and the horror of the military rule .
" people are leaving behind the fear , " he says .
" we can have a calmer look at the subject .
that does n't mean forgetting or pardoning but more justice and more truth . "
' hard to believe ' the book , nunca mas - never again , a report by argentina 's national commission on disappeared people , was first published in 1984 , just a year after the return to democracy .
it is a study of repression , detailing who was kidnapped , how they were taken and the torture they suffered .
the ford falcon is seen by many as a symbol of the repression it begins with the words : " many of the events described in this report will be hard to believe .
this is because the men and women of our nation have only heard of such horror in reports from distant places . "
that book is being re-published to mark the anniversary with new testimonies and new information that has come to light as investigators and victims ' families continue trying to understand the nightmare that befell what they thought was a modern , civilised country .
the report focuses on more than 9,000 victims - the disappeared - people who were taken in the night and their bodies never found .
human rights investigators say the true figure is closer to 30,000 .
alongside , not against the most prominent of those who refused to give up the search for justice are the mothers of the plaza de mayo .
when no-one would listen to them , they marched , silently outside the government palace in buenos aires every thursday afternoon , demanding to know what happened to their sons and daughters .
they march to this day .
they have in the past suffered death threats and constant abuse .
daniel acosta 's art has helped him come to terms with his abduction while their work continues , they find themselves now operating in a very different environment , alongside the government of president nestor kirchner , rather than against it .
they recently stopped their annual 24-hour march of resistance , designed to get the authorities to listen to their demands , because they said they were being heard .
the mothers were the catalyst for other groups such as the grandmothers of the plaza de mayo .
they search for the children who were taken as babies from prisoners and given for adoption to military or police couples .
those babies ' mothers were usually killed .
the grandmothers have found more than 80 such children so far and their work also continues .
after the return to democracy in 1983 , some of the perpetrators of some of those crimes were tried and sentenced .
but subsequently the governments of , firstly , raul alfonsin and then carlos menem pardoned the military leaders responsible for the terror .
they talked about moving on , putting the past behind them .
but the argentine people have not done that .
a recent campaign in the continued fight for justice is the " escrache " - a popular denunciation of alleged human rights violators .
last week , several thousand people turned up outside the apartment block where the former military leader , jorge rafael videla , lives .
they shouted " murderer " and threw red paint at the building .
he may never be brought to justice but the protesters are determined that his retirement , at the very least , will not be a comfortable one .
national holiday as well as the continuing search for justice , this has also been a time to remember the dead .
it is only democracy which can save a people from horror on this scale writer ernesto sabato a plaque has been unveiled in the plaza san martin , in the centre of buenos aires , naming the victims from argentina 's religious communities .
roman catholics , protestants , jews and muslims joined together to sing the national anthem and then heard the names of the victims read out .
the argentine military are firmly back in their barracks and some , humbled by the shame of the repression , have apologised for their actions in those dark years .
after a debate in congress last week , 24 march was declared a national holiday .
it will not be a celebration but a day of reflection .
in his prologue to the report nunca mas , the argentine writer ernesto sabato said : " it is only democracy which can save a people from horror on this scale . "
" only with democracy , will we be certain that never again will events such as these , which have made argentina so sadly infamous throughout the world , be repeated in our nation . "
argentina is still a nation coming to terms with its past .
but with each anniversary of the military coming to power , the confidence that it will not return to that nightmare is growing .

with a budget exceeding $ 50m -lrb- £ 28m -rrb- and a cast including jodie foster , denzel washington and clive owen , the film has the hallmarks of a studio blockbuster .
but what distinguishes inside man is lee 's stylish direction and rapid-fire dialogue from debut screenwriter russell gewirtz .
" russell respects the audience 's intelligence , in not wanting to ' dumbify ' or lower the common denominator , " says lee , 49 , who has criticised hollywood films for their lack of originality .
homage inside man sees police detective keith frazier -lrb- denzel washington -rrb- trying to outwit a gang of robbers holed up inside a manhattan bank with 50 hostages .
jodie foster plays a manhattan power-broker who must infiltrate the investigation to ensure the contents of a bank vault remain unknown .
the film pays homage to classic 1970s heist movies such as dog day afternoon and serpico with lee 's daring camerawork and plot twists .
the dialogue plays on issues of race and violence , dominant themes in lee 's previous work .
" it was a way of trying to make something contemporary , but at the same time being respectful to the films that i liked growing up , " says lee .
" the film came together quick , because denzel had a specific window , " he adds .
" if denzel was n't doing this film , it was n't getting made . "
inside man marks his fourth collaboration with 51-year-old washington , oscar-nominated for his role in lee 's 1992 film malcolm x. "
i 'd have to go to industrial light & magic to cut him out of this film ! "
spike lee on inside man star chiwetel ejiofor rising british star chiwetel ejiofor plays washington 's police sidekick bill mitchell .
" he 's a wonderful actor - and smart , " says lee , who jokes that ejiofor guaranteed that he would not end up on the cutting room floor .
" while we were shooting the film , i noticed that in every scene he stood real close to denzel - almost attached to him .
" i 'd have to go to industrial light & magic to cut him out of this film ! "
' artistry and class ' lee persuaded briton clive owen to play mastermind robber dalton russell , despite the actor 's misgivings about spending most of the film with his face hidden .
" i like working with talented people , and clive owen is someone with talent , " says lee .
" in order to make this cat-and-mouse game work , you needed someone who could plant their feet in the ground , stand toe to toe with denzel and not get blown off the screen . "
jodie foster , who plays smooth-talking businesswoman madeline white , did not want to dominate the picture .
" jodie did n't want to carry a whole film - she wanted a supporting role , " says lee , who wanted to work with the actress for some time .
" she wanted a role where she could get dressed up and look glamorous , " says lee , who credits the actress with bringing " artistry and class " to the film .
plans for film-maker ron howard to direct fell through when russell crowe approached the oscar-winning director of a beautiful mind with the script for cinderella man .
lee appears to be emulating howard with his next project , a film about 1930s boxer joe louis .
save us , joe louis is scheduled to start shooting in the autumn with oscar nominee terrence howard playing the lead .
" we 've been trying to make it for six years , " says lee , adding that after the poor performance of ali and cinderella man , studios have been reluctant to back another boxing film .
" it 's that kind of mentality that keeps good films from being made . "

the peacekeepers hope the leaflets will persuade rebels to leave the forests the united nations 's peacekeeping operation in dr congo , monuc , is using force but increasingly this is an information war .
inside a un military helicopter flying above impenetrable tropical rainforests , half a dozen men are huddled around some cardboard boxes full of leaflets .
they each pick up a handful , open the round cabin windows and hurl them out as we pass a village .
" civilians or combatants from here or abroad please come to monuc reception centres , we will provide security , " the leaflets say in both swahili and rwanda 's main language , kinyarwandan .
' personal attacks ' the leaflets are aimed at members of the fdlr militia group , which has some 10,000 armed soldiers , mostly concentrated in a swathe of forest about 100km to the west of goma , on the border between dr congo and rwanda .
its hardline core is made up of ethnic hutus from the interahamwe militia that was involved in the rwandan genocide in 1994 .
we 've lived a terrible life , eating whatever we could find ...
i want to go back to see my family and continue my life miseke fungan former rwandan rebel " this terrain - steep hills and thick forest - is similar to that of central vietnam so there is no way we can win a military victory here , " says ramon miranda ramos from monuc 's demobilisation programme .
" we have to steal supporters from the militia groups , convince them that life in the forest is no life . "
mr miranda takes us to another of his projects .
perched high on a hillside near the town of minova two hours by dirt road from goma , there is a farmyard .
past a chicken coop and some snorting pigs , sit two men in a wooden shack in front of a black radio transmitter the size of a small suitcase .
they talk earnestly into the microphone .
their voices are transmitted in a 50km radius to the rebel held areas all around .
" at the moment the messages are about how we are here to make their lives better , how there is no future for them in the forest , " mr miranda tells me .
" if that fails then we 'll start more personal attacks of their leaders , we have to undermine their support . "
' menace ' the fdlr is one of the largest of the militia groups operating in the area .
prominent too are the mai mai militias , that were mobilised by the congolese government from 1998 onwards .
those who leave the forests are given pots , pans and a radio both groups have been linked to widespread human rights abuses of congolese civilians , including thousands of rapes .
" they are a menace to the population and as far as monuc is concerned , we can never have enough security here , " jean-marie guehenno the un head of peacekeeping told the bbc in goma during a recent two-week tour of the region .
" but i think if there 's the political will here we can have credible elections in all areas this june . "
there are increasing numbers of foreign militia members coming forward to the un 's disarmament programme .
over the last year , some 1,000 fdlr fighters have voluntarily handed themselves in to monuc .
warning when we met miseke fungan at monuc 's demobilisation centre in goma , he was holding a rusting ak47 rifle , which soon joined a pile of hundreds of other guns to be destroyed .
he says he fled for his life from rwanda 12 years ago .
now he feels the situation is safe enough to go home .
some 2,000 ex-rebels have now gove back to rwanda " we 've lived a terrible life , eating whatever we could find ...
i want to go back to see my family and continue my life . "
as with all of the former militia members we interviewed , he denied ever having seen or having carried out any of the long list of atrocities on civilians in eastern dr congo in recent years .
monuc 's mr miranda says finding out who did what is not in their mandate .
" we 're here to get people out of the forests , disarm them and send them home , " he said .
" it 's as simple as that .
above all what this country needs is security . "
miseke and a group of 30 other now former militia members were then loaded onto trucks ready to be taken to the rwandan border .
over the last year , about 2,000 former militia members have been repatriated like this .
but as he was about to leave he gave a word of warning to the un .
" the people who are coming forward now have wanted to go home for some time , he said " but there are many who wo n't come out without a fight . "

the peacekeepers hope the leaflets will persuade rebels to leave the forests the united nations 's peacekeeping operation in dr congo , monuc , is using force but increasingly this is an information war .
inside a un military helicopter flying above impenetrable tropical rainforests , half a dozen men are huddled around some cardboard boxes full of leaflets .
they each pick up a handful , open the round cabin windows and hurl them out as we pass a village .
" civilians or combatants from here or abroad please come to monuc reception centres , we will provide security , " the leaflets say in both swahili and rwanda 's main language , kinyarwandan .
' personal attacks ' the leaflets are aimed at members of the fdlr militia group , which has some 10,000 armed soldiers , mostly concentrated in a swathe of forest about 100km to the west of goma , on the border between dr congo and rwanda .
its hardline core is made up of ethnic hutus from the interahamwe militia that was involved in the rwandan genocide in 1994 .
we 've lived a terrible life , eating whatever we could find ...
i want to go back to see my family and continue my life miseke fungan former rwandan rebel " this terrain - steep hills and thick forest - is similar to that of central vietnam so there is no way we can win a military victory here , " says ramon miranda ramos from monuc 's demobilisation programme .
" we have to steal supporters from the militia groups , convince them that life in the forest is no life . "
mr miranda takes us to another of his projects .
perched high on a hillside near the town of minova two hours by dirt road from goma , there is a farmyard .
past a chicken coop and some snorting pigs , sit two men in a wooden shack in front of a black radio transmitter the size of a small suitcase .
they talk earnestly into the microphone .
their voices are transmitted in a 50km radius to the rebel held areas all around .
" at the moment the messages are about how we are here to make their lives better , how there is no future for them in the forest , " mr miranda tells me .
" if that fails then we 'll start more personal attacks of their leaders , we have to undermine their support . "
' menace ' the fdlr is one of the largest of the militia groups operating in the area .
prominent too are the mai mai militias , that were mobilised by the congolese government from 1998 onwards .
those who leave the forests are given pots , pans and a radio both groups have been linked to widespread human rights abuses of congolese civilians , including thousands of rapes .
" they are a menace to the population and as far as monuc is concerned , we can never have enough security here , " jean-marie guehenno the un head of peacekeeping told the bbc in goma during a recent two-week tour of the region .
" but i think if there 's the political will here we can have credible elections in all areas this june . "
there are increasing numbers of foreign militia members coming forward to the un 's disarmament programme .
over the last year , some 1,000 fdlr fighters have voluntarily handed themselves in to monuc .
warning when we met miseke fungan at monuc 's demobilisation centre in goma , he was holding a rusting ak47 rifle , which soon joined a pile of hundreds of other guns to be destroyed .
he says he fled for his life from rwanda 12 years ago .
now he feels the situation is safe enough to go home .
some 2,000 ex-rebels have now gove back to rwanda " we 've lived a terrible life , eating whatever we could find ...
i want to go back to see my family and continue my life . "
as with all of the former militia members we interviewed , he denied ever having seen or having carried out any of the long list of atrocities on civilians in eastern dr congo in recent years .
monuc 's mr miranda says finding out who did what is not in their mandate .
" we 're here to get people out of the forests , disarm them and send them home , " he said .
" it 's as simple as that .
above all what this country needs is security . "
miseke and a group of 30 other now former militia members were then loaded onto trucks ready to be taken to the rwandan border .
over the last year , about 2,000 former militia members have been repatriated like this .
but as he was about to leave he gave a word of warning to the un .
" the people who are coming forward now have wanted to go home for some time , he said " but there are many who wo n't come out without a fight . "

gcap , formed by the merger of capital radio and gwr , said turnover was set to be 17 % lower between january and march .
partly to blame was its decision never to play more than two adverts in a row on capital .
the " inevitable disruption " of integrating capital radio and classic fm owner gwr were also cited as reasons for the drop in revenues .
last year , the broadcaster decided to halve the amount of time spent on commercials at capital during the day , a move made on the back of listener feedback .
the station 's audience figures have dropped to 1.8 million from 2.9 million in 2001 .
as a result of the drop in revenues over the first three months of the year , gcap said that like-for-like revenues for the year to 31 march were set to fall by 13 % .
sales scrapped in addition , the firm announced a u-turn on its decision to part with nine of its analogue stations in the south west and north wales , including coast fm in north wales and orchard fm , which covers the taunton and yeovil region .
gcap said several offers had been received for the radio stations , but that the money offered was not in the best interest of shareholders .
" the stations concerned remain attractive assets which will be managed for growth under the existing structure , " it said .
shares in gcap were trading down 12 pence , or 4.3 % , at 230p on friday morning .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- can you stop changes to your scheme ?
bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies friday , 24 march 2006 , 09:44 gmt can you stop changes to your scheme ?
by ian pollock bbc news personal finance reporter millions of workers may soon find that their employers try to close their pension schemes to current members and offer them a less generous alternative .
that is the situation facing staff at firms like rentokil , the co-op group , arcadia and the yorkshire and clydesdale banks .
these companies have decided that the pensions they promised for many years are now too expensive - and the staff will have to accept a new scheme that is rather less generous .
nick eyre , group secretary at the co-op , reckons that many more employers will be copying his example : " hundreds of companies are going to do this .
it 's going to become a very common feature over the next six months . "
changing your contract if the staff do not like the proposals , the first thing they should do is check their employment contracts . "
some rules have entrenched provisions which prevent changes for the future " christopher berkelely , pinsent masons these vary from employer to employer when it comes to describing any pension provision .
some may promise to offer membership of a traditional final salary pension scheme - not just whatever scheme the company happens to be offering at any one time .
ivan walker , head of pensions at the law firm thompsons , which specialises in working for trade unions , says it does happen from time to time : " a company may have been taken over , or the pension scheme been merged in the past , with a promise to members of no change to the pension scheme .
" later the employer says they want to cut back on benefits for future service - and someone digs up the old promise . "
if that promise is made , then this may be a big legal hurdle for the employer to jump .
an attempt to force workers to accept such a change might be a breach of the employment contract and could expose the employer to a charge of constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal .
this would be a high risk strategy for an employee to take because they would actually need to resign from their job to sustain such a claim .
and they might fail if the employer argued , successfully , that they simply had to close the scheme because it was a commercial necessity , for instance as an alternative to going bust .
that was the decision of an employment tribunal in london in september 2004 when some staff complained they had been unfairly dismissed by a large firm of solicitors for not agreeing to the closure of their final salary scheme .
can the scheme be closed ?
it is important to check that the employer does have the power to close the scheme , and to check if the trustees have to agree as well . "
employers need the power to redesign schemes in line with the company 's financial position " jay sheth , cbi this should be laid out in the rules of the scheme , generally be known as the " deed and rules " .
most scheme members never bother to look at them .
and normally there is no reason why they should .
but there is no such thing as a standard set of rules .
they vary tremendously from scheme to scheme .
some give employers absolute power over certain changes ; some changes may require the agreement of the trustees ; other rules may even give the trustees more or less absolute power over changes .
" some rules have entrenched provisions which prevent changes for the future , " points out christopher berkeley , head of pensions at the law firm pinsent masons .
as a matter of course , the full deed and rules should be available to all scheme members from their scheme 's administrators .
there may be one very important wrinkle in a scheme 's rules .
it is possible an employer 's decision to close the scheme to existing members might trigger a decision of the trustees to wind up the scheme altogether , not just run it as a closed fund .
that would probably be horribly expensive and might deter the employer from venturing down this path .
however , this did not deter rentokil from announcing it wanted to close its pension scheme , even at the cost of making extra payments amounting to almost £ 400m over the coming years .
obliged to consult even now , a sensible employer will consult staff over making such a big change to its pension provision .
arguably , any employer has a duty of good faith to do so . "
some consultations are a sham , some are n't .
a lot think consultation is just telling " eleanor lewington , usdaw but from this coming april , this obligation to consult the affected scheme members becomes enshrined in law as a result of the 2004 pensions act .
prospective members , such as workers who have not yet joined the scheme , should be consulted too .
that consultation might involve trade unions or other staff representatives ; asking scheme members to submit their opinions by e-mail or letter ; and holding staff meetings , seminars and road shows to provide adequate and accurate information and seek feedback from the staff .
there is even the option of a ballot .
that is what is happening with the 9,000 staff of the yorkshire and clydesdale banks , who are being asked to support the replacement of their final salary scheme with one based on average salary .
but crucially , " consultation " does not mean " agreement " .
this was welcomed by jay sheth , a senior policy officer for the employers ' organisation , the cbi : " we have always supported the idea of consultation - but employers need the power to redesign schemes in line with the company 's financial position . "
that does not give employers carte blanche to embark on a sham consultation exercise , going through the motions with no intention of taking on board any views they may get from the staff .
" some consultations are a sham , some are n't .
a lot think consultation is just telling , " according to eleanor lewington , pensions officer at the retail trade union usdaw .
if employees think that is what is happening , they will have the right to complain to the pensions regulator who can fine the employer .
however , a spokeswoman for the pensions regulator pointed out : " we do n't have powers preventing employers making changes for future provision . "
negotiation may work in many cases , the strictly legal position of employees will probably be quite weak . "
changes are in practice being made and agreed in quite a few companies where the dynamics of the business and the risk have been explained " penny green , pmi " the law is not necessarily going to help them , " says ivan walker of thompsons .
if an employer has decided in advance it wants to close its pension fund to current members , it may be hard to persuade it to change its mind altogether , at least by reasoned argument .
even so , negotiation , especially where there is a strong trade union , may produce agreement .
the pensions management institute believes that quietly , behind the scenes , many pension schemes are being changed by agreement , after consultation and negotiation .
" changes are in practice being made and agreed in quite a few companies where the dynamics of the business and the risk have been explained , " said the institute 's penny green .
strike action if negotiation fails , then the next obvious lever for disgruntled workers is the threat of going on strike or some other form of industrial action .
this is what british gas engineers did just before christmas .
as a result , the company allowed 1,700 trainees and junior staff to join the scheme before it closed to new members and the company agreed to inject more cash into its fund .
whatever approach aggrieved workers take , it seems certain they will form a swiftly growing category .

by ian pollock bbc news personal finance reporter rentokil staff are being moved to a new pension scheme .
millions of workers may soon find that their employers try to close their pension schemes to current members and offer them a less generous alternative .
that is the situation facing staff at firms like rentokil , the co-op group , arcadia and the yorkshire and clydesdale banks .
these companies have decided that the pensions they promised for many years are now too expensive - and the staff will have to accept a new scheme that is rather less generous .
nick eyre , group secretary at the co-op , reckons that many more employers will be copying his example : " hundreds of companies are going to do this .
it 's going to become a very common feature over the next six months . "
changing your contract if the staff do not like the proposals , the first thing they should do is check their employment contracts .
some rules have entrenched provisions which prevent changes for the future christopher berkelely , pinsent masons these vary from employer to employer when it comes to describing any pension provision .
some may promise to offer membership of a traditional final salary pension scheme - not just whatever scheme the company happens to be offering at any one time .
ivan walker , head of pensions at the law firm thompsons , which specialises in working for trade unions , says it does happen from time to time : " a company may have been taken over , or the pension scheme been merged in the past , with a promise to members of no change to the pension scheme .
" later the employer says they want to cut back on benefits for future service - and someone digs up the old promise . "
if that promise is made , then this may be a big legal hurdle for the employer to jump .
an attempt to force workers to accept such a change might be a breach of the employment contract and could expose the employer to a charge of constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal .
this would be a high risk strategy for an employee to take because they would actually need to resign from their job to sustain such a claim .
and they might fail if the employer argued , successfully , that they simply had to close the scheme because it was a commercial necessity , for instance as an alternative to going bust .
that was the decision of an employment tribunal in london in september 2004 when some staff complained they had been unfairly dismissed by a large firm of solicitors for not agreeing to the closure of their final salary scheme .
can the scheme be closed ?
it is important to check that the employer does have the power to close the scheme , and to check if the trustees have to agree as well .
employers need the power to redesign schemes in line with the company 's financial position jay sheth , cbi this should be laid out in the rules of the scheme , generally be known as the " deed and rules " .
most scheme members never bother to look at them .
and normally there is no reason why they should .
but there is no such thing as a standard set of rules .
they vary tremendously from scheme to scheme .
some give employers absolute power over certain changes ; some changes may require the agreement of the trustees ; other rules may even give the trustees more or less absolute power over changes .
" some rules have entrenched provisions which prevent changes for the future , " points out christopher berkeley , head of pensions at the law firm pinsent masons .
as a matter of course , the full deed and rules should be available to all scheme members from their scheme 's administrators .
there may be one very important wrinkle in a scheme 's rules .
it is possible an employer 's decision to close the scheme to existing members might trigger a decision of the trustees to wind up the scheme altogether , not just run it as a closed fund .
that would probably be horribly expensive and might deter the employer from venturing down this path .
however , this did not deter rentokil from announcing it wanted to close its pension scheme , even at the cost of making extra payments amounting to almost £ 400m over the coming years .
obliged to consult even now , a sensible employer will consult staff over making such a big change to its pension provision .
arguably , any employer has a duty of good faith to do so .
some consultations are a sham , some are n't .
a lot think consultation is just telling eleanor lewington , usdaw but from this coming april , this obligation to consult the affected scheme members becomes enshrined in law as a result of the 2004 pensions act .
prospective members , such as workers who have not yet joined the scheme , should be consulted too .
that consultation might involve trade unions or other staff representatives ; asking scheme members to submit their opinions by e-mail or letter ; and holding staff meetings , seminars and road shows to provide adequate and accurate information and seek feedback from the staff .
there is even the option of a ballot .
that is what is happening with the 9,000 staff of the yorkshire and clydesdale banks , who are being asked to support the replacement of their final salary scheme with one based on average salary .
but crucially , " consultation " does not mean " agreement " .
this was welcomed by jay sheth , a senior policy officer for the employers ' organisation , the cbi : " we have always supported the idea of consultation - but employers need the power to redesign schemes in line with the company 's financial position . "
that does not give employers carte blanche to embark on a sham consultation exercise , going through the motions with no intention of taking on board any views they may get from the staff .
" some consultations are a sham , some are n't .
a lot think consultation is just telling , " according to eleanor lewington , pensions officer at the retail trade union usdaw .
if employees think that is what is happening , they will have the right to complain to the pensions regulator who can fine the employer .
however , a spokeswoman for the pensions regulator pointed out : " we do n't have powers preventing employers making changes for future provision . "
negotiation may work in many cases , the strictly legal position of employees will probably be quite weak .
changes are in practice being made and agreed in quite a few companies where the dynamics of the business and the risk have been explained penny green , pmi " the law is not necessarily going to help them , " says ivan walker of thompsons .
if an employer has decided in advance it wants to close its pension fund to current members , it may be hard to persuade it to change its mind altogether , at least by reasoned argument .
even so , negotiation , especially where there is a strong trade union , may produce agreement .
the pensions management institute believes that quietly , behind the scenes , many pension schemes are being changed by agreement , after consultation and negotiation .
" changes are in practice being made and agreed in quite a few companies where the dynamics of the business and the risk have been explained , " said the institute 's penny green .
strike action if negotiation fails , then the next obvious lever for disgruntled workers is the threat of going on strike or some other form of industrial action .
pensioners protest outside labour 's 2004 conference this is what british gas engineers did just before christmas .
as a result , the company allowed 1,700 trainees and junior staff to join the scheme before it closed to new members and the company agreed to inject more cash into its fund .
whatever approach aggrieved workers take , it seems certain they will form a swiftly growing category .

by ian pollock bbc news personal finance reporter rentokil staff are being moved to a new pension scheme .
millions of workers may soon find that their employers try to close their pension schemes to current members and offer them a less generous alternative .
that is the situation facing staff at firms like rentokil , the co-op group , arcadia and the yorkshire and clydesdale banks .
these companies have decided that the pensions they promised for many years are now too expensive - and the staff will have to accept a new scheme that is rather less generous .
nick eyre , group secretary at the co-op , reckons that many more employers will be copying his example : " hundreds of companies are going to do this .
it 's going to become a very common feature over the next six months . "
changing your contract if the staff do not like the proposals , the first thing they should do is check their employment contracts .
some rules have entrenched provisions which prevent changes for the future christopher berkelely , pinsent masons these vary from employer to employer when it comes to describing any pension provision .
some may promise to offer membership of a traditional final salary pension scheme - not just whatever scheme the company happens to be offering at any one time .
ivan walker , head of pensions at the law firm thompsons , which specialises in working for trade unions , says it does happen from time to time : " a company may have been taken over , or the pension scheme been merged in the past , with a promise to members of no change to the pension scheme .
" later the employer says they want to cut back on benefits for future service - and someone digs up the old promise . "
if that promise is made , then this may be a big legal hurdle for the employer to jump .
an attempt to force workers to accept such a change might be a breach of the employment contract and could expose the employer to a charge of constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal .
this would be a high risk strategy for an employee to take because they would actually need to resign from their job to sustain such a claim .
and they might fail if the employer argued , successfully , that they simply had to close the scheme because it was a commercial necessity , for instance as an alternative to going bust .
that was the decision of an employment tribunal in london in september 2004 when some staff complained they had been unfairly dismissed by a large firm of solicitors for not agreeing to the closure of their final salary scheme .
can the scheme be closed ?
it is important to check that the employer does have the power to close the scheme , and to check if the trustees have to agree as well .
employers need the power to redesign schemes in line with the company 's financial position jay sheth , cbi this should be laid out in the rules of the scheme , generally be known as the " deed and rules " .
most scheme members never bother to look at them .
and normally there is no reason why they should .
but there is no such thing as a standard set of rules .
they vary tremendously from scheme to scheme .
some give employers absolute power over certain changes ; some changes may require the agreement of the trustees ; other rules may even give the trustees more or less absolute power over changes .

louise arnold steers clear a woman 's fear of peas has made the headlines , but why do people develop phobias ?
louise arnold can suffer a panic attack at the mere mention of peas .
she flees restaurants if she sees peas on a plate , and avoids the frozen veg section in the supermarket .
the list of officially-recognised phobias is long and often bizarre - anablephobia is a fear of looking up , and genuphobia is a fear of knees .
most common phobias 1 : fear of open spaces 2 : fear of public embarrassment 3 : fear of being in a car mental health foundation an estimated 13 % of the adult population will develop a phobia at some point in their life , according to one study .
but why do people develop phobias ?
it is all related to anxiety , which is a normal response to stress or danger and often called the " flight or fight " response .
it involves adrenalin being quickly pumped through the body enabling it to cope with whatever comes its way .
problems start when this response is out of proportion to the actual danger or is generated when there is no danger present .
that is when it can become an anxiety disorder , of which phobias are a category .
there are several factors that can trigger such a disorder , according to the national phobics society -lrb- nps -rrb- : stress childhood environment genetic predispositions physical factors , such as thyroid problems biochemical imbalances and changes in the levels of chemical messengers in the brain for some people it can be one of these factors that results in a phobia , while for others it can be a combination .
it is also quite common for people to suffer from more than one phobia at the same time .
while no one trigger is related to a particular phobia , often the more bizarre fears are caused by stress , while more common ones - such as the fear of spiders - are more likely to be linked to childhood environment .
who , what , why ?
a regular feature in the bbc news magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines " the woman with the pea phobia developed it after she had a baby , which can be a very stressful time , " says nicky lidbetter , manager of the nps .
" sometimes when people are at a difficult point in their lives , their subconscious attaches the stress they experience to something , like peas . "
but knowing the origins of an anxiety disorder does n't help in dealing with a phobia .
treatment focuses on people controlling their anxiety rather than the anxiety controlling them .
however , it can be reassuring for sufferers to know there are factors out of their control that may have contributed to their phobia .
add your comments on this story , using the form below .
i have an incredible fear of boats .
it 's silly and irrational and i realise that , but the bigger the ship , the more terrified i am of the thought of it floating on water or even going out to sea .
my stomach turns at the sight of tv adverts for cruises and oceanliners !
i have no idea what brought on this phobia or how it developed , but it 's there ... luckily , there 's not much need these days to board ships so it does n't really affect my everyday life .
roddy fraser , london i have extreme phobia for cats .
hence i always check before visiting anyone whether they have cats .
i would not go near or be near to a cat .
it can cause alot of anxiety in me , weeks of sleepless nights or even fall ill .
some people do not take the phobia seriously .
therefore it add further stress to me when joke about it .
christina spybey , london i have an unusual phobia , of getting my hair cut .
people think my hair is long because of my indie dress sense , but to be honest it is because i am scared to death of the chair and the scissors .
i am shaking typing this .
my last haircut was 12 months ago , when my flatmate took kitchen scissors to my head when i was asleep .
i feel ridiculous but even therapy just wo n't work .
what can i do ?
chris mccall , edinburgh i have a terrible fear of birds , feathers , and anything with wings .
walking around town squares in europe is frightening and hellish for me - the thousands of pigeons seem like brainless assassins after my life .
i detest moths too , especially the huge ones found in asia .
during a trip to the zoo i volunteered to pick up seven or eight huge reticulated pythons and sling them around my neck .
however i refused to enter the butterfly aviary afterward .
it was too scary .
ju-lee sandhu , kuala lumpur , malaysia my big brother has a phobia of gravy .
there seems to be no logic to his phobia , such as a traumatic childhood experience , but the mere mention of gravy sends him into a frenzy !
jo traynor , liverpool < i have a phobia of mould .
i know how irrational it is - until i see some mould , then i run from the room shaking .
interestingly , i like mushrooms , as long as i can see them in a punnet , not when growing .
i also get shaky at blue cheese .
i agree about the stress aspect - when i 'm under pressure my panic is far greater .
i 'm not mad .
honest .
katherine , london i 'd like to comment , but i 'm scared of computers .
tony gallagher , oamaru , new zealand i am terrified of scarecrows and i have no idea why .
i just find them truly hideous to behold .
matt , kent i have a phobia of flamingos .
if one comes on the television i normally retch .
luckily there are n't many that i come in contact with day to day .
i think it might have started with the ones in alice in wonderland when i was a child .
nadia , brighton i have severe globophobia - a fear of balloons .
it makes shopping difficult when stores are giving away balloons to children , and it is practically impossible for me to go to a party without first checking if balloons will be part of the decoration .
clair , southampton i am embarrassed to admit that i have a phobia of buttons .
even as a small child i hated being dressed in any items with buttons on them .
i am getting better as i get older and can wear certain items of clothing but still seeing small white plastic buttons makes my stomach turn -lrb- even writing this made me feel a bit odd ! -rrb-
yvonne , wilton baked beans , in fact just typing and thinking about it makes me want to vomit .
i ca n't be in the same house as anyone eating them , the smell alone brings me out in a sweat .
elaine green , littlehampton i 've feared carrots since a very young age .
i put it down to them being orange with what appears to be green hair and those teeth like fangs .

louise arnold steers clear a woman 's fear of peas has made the headlines , but why do people develop phobias ?
louise arnold can suffer a panic attack at the mere mention of peas .
she flees restaurants if she sees peas on a plate , and avoids the frozen veg section in the supermarket .
the list of officially-recognised phobias is long and often bizarre - anablephobia is a fear of looking up , and genuphobia is a fear of knees .
most common phobias 1 : fear of open spaces 2 : fear of public embarrassment 3 : fear of being in a car mental health foundation an estimated 13 % of the adult population will develop a phobia at some point in their life , according to one study .
but why do people develop phobias ?
it is all related to anxiety , which is a normal response to stress or danger and often called the " flight or fight " response .
it involves adrenalin being quickly pumped through the body enabling it to cope with whatever comes its way .
problems start when this response is out of proportion to the actual danger or is generated when there is no danger present .
that is when it can become an anxiety disorder , of which phobias are a category .
there are several factors that can trigger such a disorder , according to the national phobics society -lrb- nps -rrb- : stress childhood environment genetic predispositions physical factors , such as thyroid problems biochemical imbalances and changes in the levels of chemical messengers in the brain for some people it can be one of these factors that results in a phobia , while for others it can be a combination .
it is also quite common for people to suffer from more than one phobia at the same time .
while no one trigger is related to a particular phobia , often the more bizarre fears are caused by stress , while more common ones - such as the fear of spiders - are more likely to be linked to childhood environment .
who , what , why ?
a regular feature in the bbc news magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines " the woman with the pea phobia developed it after she had a baby , which can be a very stressful time , " says nicky lidbetter , manager of the nps .
" sometimes when people are at a difficult point in their lives , their subconscious attaches the stress they experience to something , like peas . "
but knowing the origins of an anxiety disorder does n't help in dealing with a phobia .
treatment focuses on people controlling their anxiety rather than the anxiety controlling them .
however , it can be reassuring for sufferers to know there are factors out of their control that may have contributed to their phobia .

residents filed a lawsuit saying the shika reactor , north-west of tokyo , could leak radiation during a quake .
the plant , which only began operating nine days ago , will stay open until an appeal filed by the company is heard .
japan is heavily reliant on nuclear power but confidence has been hit by a series of incidents in recent years .
earlier this week a fire broke out at another nuclear plant , ohi , in western japan , which injured two people .
and in 2004 , five workers were killed at the mihama reactor , also in the country 's west , when a corroded pipe split and sprayed workers with steam and boiling water .

japan 's shaky nuclear record the local residents said the number 2 reactor was constructed using outdated government safety guidelines .
they claimed they would be in constant danger of major accidents because it is near a fault line , where government experts say a major quake with a magnitude of 7.6 could strike .
there are 55 nuclear reactors in operation in japan and most of them lie in potential earthquake zones .
if the kanazawa ruling is upheld by the high court , that would place enormous pressure on the authorities to close down other reactors as most designs in japan are similar and the kanazawa plant is the most modern and therefore , in theory , the safest , says the bbc correspondent in tokyo , jonathan head .
the power company said it took all necessary measures to ensure the plant 's safety in the event of an earthquake .
japan relies on nuclear power plants for approximately a third of its electricity needs .
the government says it wants to build an additional 11 nuclear plants .
