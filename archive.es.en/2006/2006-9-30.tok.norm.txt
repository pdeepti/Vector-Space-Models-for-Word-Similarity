his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" the holy see calls on the competent authorities not to deport foreign christians persecuted for their faith in their home states , " germany 's new ambassador to the vatican , hans henning horstmann , told the ansa news agency . according to a summary of the meeting between benedict xvi and horstmann published by the vatican , the pope " recalled that germany has become a new homeland for many people threatened in their countries of origin for religious and political reasons " and " suggested that the right to asylum should be guaranteed by law " in germany . germany 's refugee record analysts said benedict xvi was referring to a number of recent reports by german civil rights groups criticizing berlin 's record on asylum seekers .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily . " iran does not see any reason to suspend nuclear activities , " iranian state television quoted the minister as saying . mottaki 's comments followed talks between larijani and solana here on thursday , which seemed to suggest a more conciliatory tone from iran . eu and iran claim no deal but some progress bildunterschrift : the eu and iran are still divided over a deal while both men emerged from the discussions stressing no deal had been struck , they nevertheless said progress had been made . steinmeier met with the iranian negotiator after the thursday talks , at solana 's request . he said the precise details of his discussions with the iranian negotiator would have to remain secret " as we are currently negotiating confidentially with iran . " steinmeier said he had of course informed solana about the discussions and added that the eu foreign policy chief would meet the iranian negotiator again in the middle of next week . us increases pressure on iran as talks stall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will try to stop countries selling iran weapons meanwhile , the us congress early saturday gave its final approval to a new set of sanctions targeting foreign countries that continue nuclear cooperation with iran and sell it advanced weaponry . but mindful of the situation in iraq , lawmakers warned that nothing in this document should be " construed as authorizing the use of force against iran . " although it does not name any countries , the measure is seen as a clear warning to russia and china , two key members of the un security council that have been resisting calls for new international sanctions against tehran in response to its refusal to halt uranium enrichment . russia has been involved in a 800-million-dollar project to help iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr and has been selling it modern weaponry , while china has been accused of supplying the islamic republic with advanced missile technology . the bill that passed by the senate in pre-dawn hours by voice vote and cleared the house of representatives a day earlier came as iran and the european union are engaged in delicate negotiations designed to persuade iran to halt its enrichment work and avoid a major international showdown . eu and partners to report to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will hear about the talks from solana us secretary of state condoleezza rice was expected to confer with javier solana and her counterparts from britain , china , france , germany and russia over the weekend to take stock of progress reached in these talks . following the carrot-and-stick approach adopted by washington , the iran freedom support act states that it should be the policy of the united states " not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles . " the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .
but to qualify for such aid they will have to commit to nuclear non-proliferation . under the measure , the us government may also award grants to pro-democracy radio and television stations that broadcast into iran .
" we have to increase our capability to mine resources and intelligence about iran , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the wall street journal in an interview published saturday .
" and one of the challenges is that we have n't been in the country for 26 years . " president george w. bush is expected to sign the bill into law . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , a sponsor of the bill hailed its passage by saying that it would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " democrat calls for peaceful resolution tom lantos , a holocaust survivor and the top democrat on the house international affairs committee , argued that the world should use every peaceful means possible " to defeat iran 's reckless nuclear military ambitions . " " if we fail to use the economic and diplomatic tools available to us , the world will face a nightmare that knows no end : a despotic , fundamentalist regime wedded both to terrorism and to the most terrifying weapons known to man , " lantos said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no accord in iran-eu nuclear talks as time runs out iran and the eu failed to reach agreement in a fresh round of talks in berlin thursday on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , prompting the us to warn the islamic republic the clock was ticking on sanctions .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily . " iran does not see any reason to suspend nuclear activities , " iranian state television quoted the minister as saying . mottaki 's comments followed talks between larijani and solana here on thursday , which seemed to suggest a more conciliatory tone from iran . eu and iran claim no deal but some progress bildunterschrift : the eu and iran are still divided over a deal while both men emerged from the discussions stressing no deal had been struck , they nevertheless said progress had been made . steinmeier met with the iranian negotiator after the thursday talks , at solana 's request . he said the precise details of his discussions with the iranian negotiator would have to remain secret " as we are currently negotiating confidentially with iran . " steinmeier said he had of course informed solana about the discussions and added that the eu foreign policy chief would meet the iranian negotiator again in the middle of next week . us increases pressure on iran as talks stall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will try to stop countries selling iran weapons meanwhile , the us congress early saturday gave its final approval to a new set of sanctions targeting foreign countries that continue nuclear cooperation with iran and sell it advanced weaponry . but mindful of the situation in iraq , lawmakers warned that nothing in this document should be " construed as authorizing the use of force against iran . " although it does not name any countries , the measure is seen as a clear warning to russia and china , two key members of the un security council that have been resisting calls for new international sanctions against tehran in response to its refusal to halt uranium enrichment . russia has been involved in a 800-million-dollar project to help iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr and has been selling it modern weaponry , while china has been accused of supplying the islamic republic with advanced missile technology . the bill that passed by the senate in pre-dawn hours by voice vote and cleared the house of representatives a day earlier came as iran and the european union are engaged in delicate negotiations designed to persuade iran to halt its enrichment work and avoid a major international showdown . eu and partners to report to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will hear about the talks from solana us secretary of state condoleezza rice was expected to confer with javier solana and her counterparts from britain , china , france , germany and russia over the weekend to take stock of progress reached in these talks . following the carrot-and-stick approach adopted by washington , the iran freedom support act states that it should be the policy of the united states " not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles . " the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .
but to qualify for such aid they will have to commit to nuclear non-proliferation . under the measure , the us government may also award grants to pro-democracy radio and television stations that broadcast into iran .
" we have to increase our capability to mine resources and intelligence about iran , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the wall street journal in an interview published saturday .
" and one of the challenges is that we have n't been in the country for 26 years . " president george w. bush is expected to sign the bill into law . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , a sponsor of the bill hailed its passage by saying that it would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " democrat calls for peaceful resolution tom lantos , a holocaust survivor and the top democrat on the house international affairs committee , argued that the world should use every peaceful means possible " to defeat iran 's reckless nuclear military ambitions . " " if we fail to use the economic and diplomatic tools available to us , the world will face a nightmare that knows no end : a despotic , fundamentalist regime wedded both to terrorism and to the most terrifying weapons known to man , " lantos said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no accord in iran-eu nuclear talks as time runs out iran and the eu failed to reach agreement in a fresh round of talks in berlin thursday on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , prompting the us to warn the islamic republic the clock was ticking on sanctions .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad .

he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .

the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit .

the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed .

" the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .

the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed . " europe 's problem is less the lack of new ideas but more the transformation of new ideas into innovation and global competitiveness , the availability of financial resources including venture capital , the provision of research- and innovation-friendly conditions and the entrepreneurial spirit that bridges the academic and industrial world , " reads the paper .

" they excel through an open attitude to new ideas , a close cooperation with industry and an entrepreneurial spirit that encourages personal movement back and forth between universities and companies . " it seems that the idea of a single institute , if the eit is ever to be realized at all , is one neither the politicians or the industry leaders believe in . " it 's already clear there will not be a european type of mit , " eu commission vice president günter verheugen told a news briefing last week .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily . " iran does not see any reason to suspend nuclear activities , " iranian state television quoted the minister as saying . mottaki 's comments followed talks between larijani and solana here on thursday , which seemed to suggest a more conciliatory tone from iran . eu and iran claim no deal but some progress bildunterschrift : the eu and iran are still divided over a deal while both men emerged from the discussions stressing no deal had been struck , they nevertheless said progress had been made . steinmeier met with the iranian negotiator after the thursday talks , at solana 's request . he said the precise details of his discussions with the iranian negotiator would have to remain secret " as we are currently negotiating confidentially with iran . " steinmeier said he had of course informed solana about the discussions and added that the eu foreign policy chief would meet the iranian negotiator again in the middle of next week . us increases pressure on iran as talks stall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will try to stop countries selling iran weapons meanwhile , the us congress early saturday gave its final approval to a new set of sanctions targeting foreign countries that continue nuclear cooperation with iran and sell it advanced weaponry . but mindful of the situation in iraq , lawmakers warned that nothing in this document should be " construed as authorizing the use of force against iran . " although it does not name any countries , the measure is seen as a clear warning to russia and china , two key members of the un security council that have been resisting calls for new international sanctions against tehran in response to its refusal to halt uranium enrichment . russia has been involved in a 800-million-dollar project to help iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr and has been selling it modern weaponry , while china has been accused of supplying the islamic republic with advanced missile technology . the bill that passed by the senate in pre-dawn hours by voice vote and cleared the house of representatives a day earlier came as iran and the european union are engaged in delicate negotiations designed to persuade iran to halt its enrichment work and avoid a major international showdown . eu and partners to report to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will hear about the talks from solana us secretary of state condoleezza rice was expected to confer with javier solana and her counterparts from britain , china , france , germany and russia over the weekend to take stock of progress reached in these talks . following the carrot-and-stick approach adopted by washington , the iran freedom support act states that it should be the policy of the united states " not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles . " the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .
but to qualify for such aid they will have to commit to nuclear non-proliferation . under the measure , the us government may also award grants to pro-democracy radio and television stations that broadcast into iran .
" we have to increase our capability to mine resources and intelligence about iran , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the wall street journal in an interview published saturday .
" and one of the challenges is that we have n't been in the country for 26 years . " president george w. bush is expected to sign the bill into law . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , a sponsor of the bill hailed its passage by saying that it would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " democrat calls for peaceful resolution tom lantos , a holocaust survivor and the top democrat on the house international affairs committee , argued that the world should use every peaceful means possible " to defeat iran 's reckless nuclear military ambitions . " " if we fail to use the economic and diplomatic tools available to us , the world will face a nightmare that knows no end : a despotic , fundamentalist regime wedded both to terrorism and to the most terrifying weapons known to man , " lantos said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no accord in iran-eu nuclear talks as time runs out iran and the eu failed to reach agreement in a fresh round of talks in berlin thursday on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , prompting the us to warn the islamic republic the clock was ticking on sanctions .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with .

" with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .

" the holy see calls on the competent authorities not to deport foreign christians persecuted for their faith in their home states , " germany 's new ambassador to the vatican , hans henning horstmann , told the ansa news agency . according to a summary of the meeting between benedict xvi and horstmann published by the vatican , the pope " recalled that germany has become a new homeland for many people threatened in their countries of origin for religious and political reasons " and " suggested that the right to asylum should be guaranteed by law " in germany . germany 's refugee record analysts said benedict xvi was referring to a number of recent reports by german civil rights groups criticizing berlin 's record on asylum seekers .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily . " iran does not see any reason to suspend nuclear activities , " iranian state television quoted the minister as saying . mottaki 's comments followed talks between larijani and solana here on thursday , which seemed to suggest a more conciliatory tone from iran . eu and iran claim no deal but some progress bildunterschrift : the eu and iran are still divided over a deal while both men emerged from the discussions stressing no deal had been struck , they nevertheless said progress had been made . steinmeier met with the iranian negotiator after the thursday talks , at solana 's request . he said the precise details of his discussions with the iranian negotiator would have to remain secret " as we are currently negotiating confidentially with iran . " steinmeier said he had of course informed solana about the discussions and added that the eu foreign policy chief would meet the iranian negotiator again in the middle of next week . us increases pressure on iran as talks stall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will try to stop countries selling iran weapons meanwhile , the us congress early saturday gave its final approval to a new set of sanctions targeting foreign countries that continue nuclear cooperation with iran and sell it advanced weaponry . but mindful of the situation in iraq , lawmakers warned that nothing in this document should be " construed as authorizing the use of force against iran . " although it does not name any countries , the measure is seen as a clear warning to russia and china , two key members of the un security council that have been resisting calls for new international sanctions against tehran in response to its refusal to halt uranium enrichment . russia has been involved in a 800-million-dollar project to help iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr and has been selling it modern weaponry , while china has been accused of supplying the islamic republic with advanced missile technology . the bill that passed by the senate in pre-dawn hours by voice vote and cleared the house of representatives a day earlier came as iran and the european union are engaged in delicate negotiations designed to persuade iran to halt its enrichment work and avoid a major international showdown . eu and partners to report to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will hear about the talks from solana us secretary of state condoleezza rice was expected to confer with javier solana and her counterparts from britain , china , france , germany and russia over the weekend to take stock of progress reached in these talks . following the carrot-and-stick approach adopted by washington , the iran freedom support act states that it should be the policy of the united states " not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles . " the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .
but to qualify for such aid they will have to commit to nuclear non-proliferation . under the measure , the us government may also award grants to pro-democracy radio and television stations that broadcast into iran .
" we have to increase our capability to mine resources and intelligence about iran , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the wall street journal in an interview published saturday .
" and one of the challenges is that we have n't been in the country for 26 years . " president george w. bush is expected to sign the bill into law . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , a sponsor of the bill hailed its passage by saying that it would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " democrat calls for peaceful resolution tom lantos , a holocaust survivor and the top democrat on the house international affairs committee , argued that the world should use every peaceful means possible " to defeat iran 's reckless nuclear military ambitions . " " if we fail to use the economic and diplomatic tools available to us , the world will face a nightmare that knows no end : a despotic , fundamentalist regime wedded both to terrorism and to the most terrifying weapons known to man , " lantos said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no accord in iran-eu nuclear talks as time runs out iran and the eu failed to reach agreement in a fresh round of talks in berlin thursday on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , prompting the us to warn the islamic republic the clock was ticking on sanctions .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks .

" the holy see calls on the competent authorities not to deport foreign christians persecuted for their faith in their home states , " germany 's new ambassador to the vatican , hans henning horstmann , told the ansa news agency . according to a summary of the meeting between benedict xvi and horstmann published by the vatican , the pope " recalled that germany has become a new homeland for many people threatened in their countries of origin for religious and political reasons " and " suggested that the right to asylum should be guaranteed by law " in germany . germany 's refugee record analysts said benedict xvi was referring to a number of recent reports by german civil rights groups criticizing berlin 's record on asylum seekers .

their presence is ' ' tolerated " by the authorities , but they do not have residence permits and are thus constantly at risk of being deported . over 120,000 immigrants with such undefined legal status have lived in germany for more than five years , pro asyl said on its web site .
many are refugees of wars who were not granted asylum , but could not be deported , and have now integrated into germany society , creating ties with the community . germany 's immigration rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees have protested in the past in germany , residence permits are granted to asylum seeker if they can not leave germany within 18 months of arriving ' ' through no fault of their own , " according to the interior ministry .

2005 .
it was intended to give immigrants more rights .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .
" we would be better advised to make better use of what we have . " eit necessary for europe 's growth while eu politicians are cool on the idea of the eit , the concept has the approval of the leaders of europe 's digital technology sector .
the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed . " europe 's problem is less the lack of new ideas but more the transformation of new ideas into innovation and global competitiveness , the availability of financial resources including venture capital , the provision of research- and innovation-friendly conditions and the entrepreneurial spirit that bridges the academic and industrial world , " reads the paper .
eu should follow us to compete with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mit should be the model for europe , experts say the paper concludes by advising the eu to actually follow the lead of the americans to remain competitive with them . " universities -lrb- in the us -rrb- have not achieved their strong position primarily through lavish funding or networks of cooperation over state borders , " according to the document .
" they excel through an open attitude to new ideas , a close cooperation with industry and an entrepreneurial spirit that encourages personal movement back and forth between universities and companies . " it seems that the idea of a single institute , if the eit is ever to be realized at all , is one neither the politicians or the industry leaders believe in . " it 's already clear there will not be a european type of mit , " eu commission vice president günter verheugen told a news briefing last week .
" it will not have a single location .
basically it would be a networking of centers of excellence in the public and private sectors .

" my goal is to use all my experience to make the 2010 world cup a full success , " said schmidt , who still serves as the dfb 's general secretary . the month-long tournament in germany concluded nearly without a hitch this summer as stadiums and public viewing areas filled and fears of hooliganism proved unfounded , leading fifa general secretary urs linsi to describe the appointment as " a real win " for the world body . " there is no one around the world who combines so much experience in the areas of organization , security or ticketing , " he said . crisis manager or just lending a hand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt said he will remain the dfb 's general secretary while advising the south africans fifa had confirmed last week they were interested in appointing schmidt , but denied he was acting as a crisis manager amid reports of concerns about the local organizing committee 's progress .

after the success of the 2006 world cup , the 2006 hosts were committed to helping fifa and the south african organizers , and schmidt was " just the right man " to help organize the first world cup on the african continent . planning trip to south africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter said he has seen the decisions but not construction in south africa fifa president joseph blatter said earlier this month he intended to visit south africa soon to urge lawmakers to speed up building work . blatter said he wanted to meet south african president thabo mbeki and make an appeal to the country 's parliament " to explain the value of the world cup and to fire up the organizing committee , because it 's the last moment to start building five stadiums . " he added that he hoped the work in south africa would get underway before the end of the year . blatter did not comment on whether fifa was creating contingency plans to host the 2010 tournament outside of south africa if the country could not create an adequately infrastructure in time for the cup .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily . " iran does not see any reason to suspend nuclear activities , " iranian state television quoted the minister as saying . mottaki 's comments followed talks between larijani and solana here on thursday , which seemed to suggest a more conciliatory tone from iran . eu and iran claim no deal but some progress bildunterschrift : the eu and iran are still divided over a deal while both men emerged from the discussions stressing no deal had been struck , they nevertheless said progress had been made . steinmeier met with the iranian negotiator after the thursday talks , at solana 's request . he said the precise details of his discussions with the iranian negotiator would have to remain secret " as we are currently negotiating confidentially with iran . " steinmeier said he had of course informed solana about the discussions and added that the eu foreign policy chief would meet the iranian negotiator again in the middle of next week . us increases pressure on iran as talks stall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will try to stop countries selling iran weapons meanwhile , the us congress early saturday gave its final approval to a new set of sanctions targeting foreign countries that continue nuclear cooperation with iran and sell it advanced weaponry . but mindful of the situation in iraq , lawmakers warned that nothing in this document should be " construed as authorizing the use of force against iran . " although it does not name any countries , the measure is seen as a clear warning to russia and china , two key members of the un security council that have been resisting calls for new international sanctions against tehran in response to its refusal to halt uranium enrichment . russia has been involved in a 800-million-dollar project to help iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr and has been selling it modern weaponry , while china has been accused of supplying the islamic republic with advanced missile technology . the bill that passed by the senate in pre-dawn hours by voice vote and cleared the house of representatives a day earlier came as iran and the european union are engaged in delicate negotiations designed to persuade iran to halt its enrichment work and avoid a major international showdown . eu and partners to report to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will hear about the talks from solana us secretary of state condoleezza rice was expected to confer with javier solana and her counterparts from britain , china , france , germany and russia over the weekend to take stock of progress reached in these talks . following the carrot-and-stick approach adopted by washington , the iran freedom support act states that it should be the policy of the united states " not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles . " the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .
but to qualify for such aid they will have to commit to nuclear non-proliferation . under the measure , the us government may also award grants to pro-democracy radio and television stations that broadcast into iran .
" we have to increase our capability to mine resources and intelligence about iran , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the wall street journal in an interview published saturday .
" and one of the challenges is that we have n't been in the country for 26 years . " president george w. bush is expected to sign the bill into law . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , a sponsor of the bill hailed its passage by saying that it would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " democrat calls for peaceful resolution tom lantos , a holocaust survivor and the top democrat on the house international affairs committee , argued that the world should use every peaceful means possible " to defeat iran 's reckless nuclear military ambitions . " " if we fail to use the economic and diplomatic tools available to us , the world will face a nightmare that knows no end : a despotic , fundamentalist regime wedded both to terrorism and to the most terrifying weapons known to man , " lantos said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no accord in iran-eu nuclear talks as time runs out iran and the eu failed to reach agreement in a fresh round of talks in berlin thursday on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , prompting the us to warn the islamic republic the clock was ticking on sanctions .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" he added that he hoped the work in south africa would get underway before the end of the year . blatter did not comment on whether fifa was creating contingency plans to host the 2010 tournament outside of south africa if the country could not create an adequately infrastructure in time for the cup .

suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .
" we would be better advised to make better use of what we have . " eit necessary for europe 's growth while eu politicians are cool on the idea of the eit , the concept has the approval of the leaders of europe 's digital technology sector .
the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed . " europe 's problem is less the lack of new ideas but more the transformation of new ideas into innovation and global competitiveness , the availability of financial resources including venture capital , the provision of research- and innovation-friendly conditions and the entrepreneurial spirit that bridges the academic and industrial world , " reads the paper .
eu should follow us to compete with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mit should be the model for europe , experts say the paper concludes by advising the eu to actually follow the lead of the americans to remain competitive with them . " universities -lrb- in the us -rrb- have not achieved their strong position primarily through lavish funding or networks of cooperation over state borders , " according to the document .
" they excel through an open attitude to new ideas , a close cooperation with industry and an entrepreneurial spirit that encourages personal movement back and forth between universities and companies . " it seems that the idea of a single institute , if the eit is ever to be realized at all , is one neither the politicians or the industry leaders believe in . " it 's already clear there will not be a european type of mit , " eu commission vice president günter verheugen told a news briefing last week .
" it will not have a single location .
basically it would be a networking of centers of excellence in the public and private sectors . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying for european research the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping , but how do scientists get their hands on the money ? -lrb- 02.06.2005 -rrb- high hurdles for bright talent to study in europe the fight for bright minds is fierce .
the european union wants other country 's talent to come here but the eu 's requirements for them to study and research in europe resemble an obstacle course .
-lrb- 04.06.2006 -rrb- european innovation losing out to japan , us scandinavia is the best when it comes to innovation in the eu 25 , but offers no competition to worldbeaters america and japan , according to a new study .
the eu 's executive arm is concerned .
-lrb- 16.01.2006 -rrb- feedback is having a european institute of technology really a necessity or can the eu enhance its competitiveness in other ways ?

" the holy see calls on the competent authorities not to deport foreign christians persecuted for their faith in their home states , " germany 's new ambassador to the vatican , hans henning horstmann , told the ansa news agency . according to a summary of the meeting between benedict xvi and horstmann published by the vatican , the pope " recalled that germany has become a new homeland for many people threatened in their countries of origin for religious and political reasons " and " suggested that the right to asylum should be guaranteed by law " in germany . germany 's refugee record analysts said benedict xvi was referring to a number of recent reports by german civil rights groups criticizing berlin 's record on asylum seekers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil rights group are critical of the treatment of asylum seekers in germany one such document published by the pro asyl group , " germany , world champion for expulsions , " said germany had expelled 40,000 asylum seekers , most of them from kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , during the past three years . according to pro asyl , some 200,000 people in germany live in a sort of grey area , in which their legal status is unclear .
their presence is ' ' tolerated " by the authorities , but they do not have residence permits and are thus constantly at risk of being deported . over 120,000 immigrants with such undefined legal status have lived in germany for more than five years , pro asyl said on its web site .

" the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .
" we would be better advised to make better use of what we have . " eit necessary for europe 's growth while eu politicians are cool on the idea of the eit , the concept has the approval of the leaders of europe 's digital technology sector .
the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed . " europe 's problem is less the lack of new ideas but more the transformation of new ideas into innovation and global competitiveness , the availability of financial resources including venture capital , the provision of research- and innovation-friendly conditions and the entrepreneurial spirit that bridges the academic and industrial world , " reads the paper .
eu should follow us to compete with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mit should be the model for europe , experts say the paper concludes by advising the eu to actually follow the lead of the americans to remain competitive with them . " universities -lrb- in the us -rrb- have not achieved their strong position primarily through lavish funding or networks of cooperation over state borders , " according to the document .
" they excel through an open attitude to new ideas , a close cooperation with industry and an entrepreneurial spirit that encourages personal movement back and forth between universities and companies . " it seems that the idea of a single institute , if the eit is ever to be realized at all , is one neither the politicians or the industry leaders believe in . " it 's already clear there will not be a european type of mit , " eu commission vice president günter verheugen told a news briefing last week .
" it will not have a single location .
basically it would be a networking of centers of excellence in the public and private sectors .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily .

" the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .
" we would be better advised to make better use of what we have . " eit necessary for europe 's growth while eu politicians are cool on the idea of the eit , the concept has the approval of the leaders of europe 's digital technology sector .
the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed . " europe 's problem is less the lack of new ideas but more the transformation of new ideas into innovation and global competitiveness , the availability of financial resources including venture capital , the provision of research- and innovation-friendly conditions and the entrepreneurial spirit that bridges the academic and industrial world , " reads the paper .
eu should follow us to compete with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mit should be the model for europe , experts say the paper concludes by advising the eu to actually follow the lead of the americans to remain competitive with them . " universities -lrb- in the us -rrb- have not achieved their strong position primarily through lavish funding or networks of cooperation over state borders , " according to the document .
" they excel through an open attitude to new ideas , a close cooperation with industry and an entrepreneurial spirit that encourages personal movement back and forth between universities and companies . " it seems that the idea of a single institute , if the eit is ever to be realized at all , is one neither the politicians or the industry leaders believe in . " it 's already clear there will not be a european type of mit , " eu commission vice president günter verheugen told a news briefing last week .

the report comes days after german help in the south was officially ruled out . german military aircraft are supporting nato operations in volatile southern afghanistan , a defence ministry spokesman said saturday , confirming a report to appear in monday 's edition of the weekly der spiegel . the report came after defence minister franz josef jung ruled out any possibility of transferring german troops from the north to help fight a dogged taliban-led insurgency in the south . der spiegel said german transall transport aircraft and helicopters had made some 60 flights this year into the south , ferrying allied soldiers and evacuating wounded . secret mission a compromise in deployment discussions the weekly said the operation , hitherto kept secret , was largely aimed at deflecting pressure on berlin to switch forces to the south from the more peaceful north , where it has some 2,750 troops deployed . the german parliament on thursday agreed to extend the contingent 's mission for another year , but jung said it would be " totally wrong " to move troops from the north , where attacks had " almost doubled " in the past 12 months . also thursday nato agreed to expand its military operations into eastern afghanistan , even as it struggles to find troops to hold the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escalating violence has nato forces stretched the agreement , endorsed at a meeting of alliance defence ministers , would see some 12,000 us troops come under nato control within afghanistan 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- within weeks . it would permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle . violence increases threat of all-out war us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer both urged the allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements called for by supreme commander us general james jones . but us officers in the east say attacks on their troops have increased two- to three-fold recently , and , according to one diplomat , jones told the ministers that the threat in the west had " gone from medium to high .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily . " iran does not see any reason to suspend nuclear activities , " iranian state television quoted the minister as saying . mottaki 's comments followed talks between larijani and solana here on thursday , which seemed to suggest a more conciliatory tone from iran . eu and iran claim no deal but some progress bildunterschrift : the eu and iran are still divided over a deal while both men emerged from the discussions stressing no deal had been struck , they nevertheless said progress had been made . steinmeier met with the iranian negotiator after the thursday talks , at solana 's request . he said the precise details of his discussions with the iranian negotiator would have to remain secret " as we are currently negotiating confidentially with iran . " steinmeier said he had of course informed solana about the discussions and added that the eu foreign policy chief would meet the iranian negotiator again in the middle of next week . us increases pressure on iran as talks stall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will try to stop countries selling iran weapons meanwhile , the us congress early saturday gave its final approval to a new set of sanctions targeting foreign countries that continue nuclear cooperation with iran and sell it advanced weaponry . but mindful of the situation in iraq , lawmakers warned that nothing in this document should be " construed as authorizing the use of force against iran . " although it does not name any countries , the measure is seen as a clear warning to russia and china , two key members of the un security council that have been resisting calls for new international sanctions against tehran in response to its refusal to halt uranium enrichment . russia has been involved in a 800-million-dollar project to help iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr and has been selling it modern weaponry , while china has been accused of supplying the islamic republic with advanced missile technology . the bill that passed by the senate in pre-dawn hours by voice vote and cleared the house of representatives a day earlier came as iran and the european union are engaged in delicate negotiations designed to persuade iran to halt its enrichment work and avoid a major international showdown . eu and partners to report to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will hear about the talks from solana us secretary of state condoleezza rice was expected to confer with javier solana and her counterparts from britain , china , france , germany and russia over the weekend to take stock of progress reached in these talks . following the carrot-and-stick approach adopted by washington , the iran freedom support act states that it should be the policy of the united states " not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles . " the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .
but to qualify for such aid they will have to commit to nuclear non-proliferation . under the measure , the us government may also award grants to pro-democracy radio and television stations that broadcast into iran .
" we have to increase our capability to mine resources and intelligence about iran , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the wall street journal in an interview published saturday .
" and one of the challenges is that we have n't been in the country for 26 years . " president george w. bush is expected to sign the bill into law . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , a sponsor of the bill hailed its passage by saying that it would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " democrat calls for peaceful resolution tom lantos , a holocaust survivor and the top democrat on the house international affairs committee , argued that the world should use every peaceful means possible " to defeat iran 's reckless nuclear military ambitions . " " if we fail to use the economic and diplomatic tools available to us , the world will face a nightmare that knows no end : a despotic , fundamentalist regime wedded both to terrorism and to the most terrifying weapons known to man , " lantos said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no accord in iran-eu nuclear talks as time runs out iran and the eu failed to reach agreement in a fresh round of talks in berlin thursday on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , prompting the us to warn the islamic republic the clock was ticking on sanctions .

" we need what i would call trustworthy signals from the iranian leadership , " steinmeier said during an interview with private television station n-tv . " decisions must be reached in iran , and there still seem to be discussions going on about those decisions , " the minister added , in what appeared to be a suggestion that the iranian leadership was divided about which direction to take in the current talks . " we have reached a decisive point in time but the decisive step has not been taken . " conflicting signals emanating from tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana with ali larijani larijani arrived in germany on wednesday for talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , designed to break the deadlock over tehran 's refusal to heed a united nations call for it to cease its uranium enrichment activities . but since his arrival , conflicting signals have come from iran over tehran 's stance on the crisis . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki took a tough line on friday , insisting there was no reason for his country to halt its nuclear programme , even temporarily . " iran does not see any reason to suspend nuclear activities , " iranian state television quoted the minister as saying . mottaki 's comments followed talks between larijani and solana here on thursday , which seemed to suggest a more conciliatory tone from iran . eu and iran claim no deal but some progress bildunterschrift : the eu and iran are still divided over a deal while both men emerged from the discussions stressing no deal had been struck , they nevertheless said progress had been made . steinmeier met with the iranian negotiator after the thursday talks , at solana 's request . he said the precise details of his discussions with the iranian negotiator would have to remain secret " as we are currently negotiating confidentially with iran . " steinmeier said he had of course informed solana about the discussions and added that the eu foreign policy chief would meet the iranian negotiator again in the middle of next week . us increases pressure on iran as talks stall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will try to stop countries selling iran weapons meanwhile , the us congress early saturday gave its final approval to a new set of sanctions targeting foreign countries that continue nuclear cooperation with iran and sell it advanced weaponry . but mindful of the situation in iraq , lawmakers warned that nothing in this document should be " construed as authorizing the use of force against iran . " although it does not name any countries , the measure is seen as a clear warning to russia and china , two key members of the un security council that have been resisting calls for new international sanctions against tehran in response to its refusal to halt uranium enrichment . russia has been involved in a 800-million-dollar project to help iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr and has been selling it modern weaponry , while china has been accused of supplying the islamic republic with advanced missile technology . the bill that passed by the senate in pre-dawn hours by voice vote and cleared the house of representatives a day earlier came as iran and the european union are engaged in delicate negotiations designed to persuade iran to halt its enrichment work and avoid a major international showdown . eu and partners to report to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will hear about the talks from solana us secretary of state condoleezza rice was expected to confer with javier solana and her counterparts from britain , china , france , germany and russia over the weekend to take stock of progress reached in these talks . following the carrot-and-stick approach adopted by washington , the iran freedom support act states that it should be the policy of the united states " not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles . " the measure calls for this policy to remain in effect until iran has suspended all enrichment-related activities , committed to verifiably and permanently refrain from such nuclear work in the future or the targeted country has severed ties with its iranian partners . the president has been granted the right to waive provisions of the bill , if he finds that us national security interests warrant it . bush to okay act to promote democracy in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush wants to push for democracy in iran mirroring the 1998 iraq liberation act that set in motion the policy of regime change there , the bill authorizes the president to provide financial and political assistance to foreign and iranian individuals and organizations that promote democracy for iran .
but to qualify for such aid they will have to commit to nuclear non-proliferation . under the measure , the us government may also award grants to pro-democracy radio and television stations that broadcast into iran .
" we have to increase our capability to mine resources and intelligence about iran , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice told the wall street journal in an interview published saturday .
" and one of the challenges is that we have n't been in the country for 26 years . " president george w. bush is expected to sign the bill into law . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , a sponsor of the bill hailed its passage by saying that it would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " democrat calls for peaceful resolution tom lantos , a holocaust survivor and the top democrat on the house international affairs committee , argued that the world should use every peaceful means possible " to defeat iran 's reckless nuclear military ambitions . " " if we fail to use the economic and diplomatic tools available to us , the world will face a nightmare that knows no end : a despotic , fundamentalist regime wedded both to terrorism and to the most terrifying weapons known to man , " lantos said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no accord in iran-eu nuclear talks as time runs out iran and the eu failed to reach agreement in a fresh round of talks in berlin thursday on tehran 's disputed nuclear program , prompting the us to warn the islamic republic the clock was ticking on sanctions .
-lrb- 29.09.2006 -rrb- iran negotiator sees " positive conclusions " in nuclear talks iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said thursday that two days of talks in berlin with the eu 's foreign policy chief solana had produced " some positive conclusions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 30.09.2006 eu ministers cool on technology institute plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technology leaders believe the institute is vital in the eu 's bid to remain competitive it is seen as a necessity in europe 's struggle to compete with the united states in the field of innovation , but the proposed european institute of technology has few supporters in the 25-nation bloc . the european union 's attempt to close the gap in innovation and technology between itself and its main rival , the united states , was dealt another blow this week when eu ministers once again labeled the idea of a european institute of technology -lrb- eit -rrb- as " unnecessary . " the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .
" we would be better advised to make better use of what we have . " eit necessary for europe 's growth while eu politicians are cool on the idea of the eit , the concept has the approval of the leaders of europe 's digital technology sector .
the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed . " europe 's problem is less the lack of new ideas but more the transformation of new ideas into innovation and global competitiveness , the availability of financial resources including venture capital , the provision of research- and innovation-friendly conditions and the entrepreneurial spirit that bridges the academic and industrial world , " reads the paper .
eu should follow us to compete with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mit should be the model for europe , experts say the paper concludes by advising the eu to actually follow the lead of the americans to remain competitive with them . " universities -lrb- in the us -rrb- have not achieved their strong position primarily through lavish funding or networks of cooperation over state borders , " according to the document .
" they excel through an open attitude to new ideas , a close cooperation with industry and an entrepreneurial spirit that encourages personal movement back and forth between universities and companies . " it seems that the idea of a single institute , if the eit is ever to be realized at all , is one neither the politicians or the industry leaders believe in . " it 's already clear there will not be a european type of mit , " eu commission vice president günter verheugen told a news briefing last week .
" it will not have a single location .
basically it would be a networking of centers of excellence in the public and private sectors . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying for european research the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping , but how do scientists get their hands on the money ? -lrb- 02.06.2005 -rrb- high hurdles for bright talent to study in europe the fight for bright minds is fierce .
the european union wants other country 's talent to come here but the eu 's requirements for them to study and research in europe resemble an obstacle course .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .
" we would be better advised to make better use of what we have . " eit necessary for europe 's growth while eu politicians are cool on the idea of the eit , the concept has the approval of the leaders of europe 's digital technology sector .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

" the eu will continue to play catch up to the us in terms of investment and research on as the focus shifts towards reviving stalled eu patent talks , which are floundering on arguments over how many languages should be used and the cost of translating patents within the 25-nation bloc . europe has suffered a " brain drain " in recent years as scientists and researchers have left the continent for better equipped and funded institutions in the united states .
the creation of the eit was seen as the bloc 's answer to the world-renowned massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- and an attractive incentive for european scientists to stay within the bloc . there had even been talk of the eit being located in the european parliament 's building in strasbourg as a compromise in the on-going argument within the eu over the split seat of european power .
with the eit based in strasbourg , the european parliament could be fully based in brussels , saving the bloc a lot of money in terms of regular travel between the two sites and the upkeep of two large administration sites . eu ministers see no need for eit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eit is unlikely to move into the eu 's strasbourg base while the eit location appears an attractive option , the creation of such an institution in itself has very few supporters - despite being part of the european union executive 's 10-point plan to boost innovation .
ministers will meet to discuss the plan at an informal summit of eu leaders next month but it is unlikely that that the shift in priority to patents will be reversed in favor of the eit . " we do n't need europe to create a european institute of technology , " german junior minister joachim würmeling told a meeting of eu competitiveness ministers last week .
these sentiments were echoed by italian minister emma bonino . " we do n't need any new structures , " she said .
" we would be better advised to make better use of what we have . " eit necessary for europe 's growth while eu politicians are cool on the idea of the eit , the concept has the approval of the leaders of europe 's digital technology sector .
the eicta , the european information and communication technologies association , wrote in a recent paper that the eit would help strengthen existing networks between the best universities , research institutes and industrial research development labs in europe .
the eicta believes that initiatives seeking to boost europe 's performance in research and development -lrb- r & d -rrb- and innovation are much needed . " europe 's problem is less the lack of new ideas but more the transformation of new ideas into innovation and global competitiveness , the availability of financial resources including venture capital , the provision of research- and innovation-friendly conditions and the entrepreneurial spirit that bridges the academic and industrial world , " reads the paper .
eu should follow us to compete with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mit should be the model for europe , experts say the paper concludes by advising the eu to actually follow the lead of the americans to remain competitive with them . " universities -lrb- in the us -rrb- have not achieved their strong position primarily through lavish funding or networks of cooperation over state borders , " according to the document .
" they excel through an open attitude to new ideas , a close cooperation with industry and an entrepreneurial spirit that encourages personal movement back and forth between universities and companies .

his memoirs , entitled ' destined to witness : growing up black in nazi germany , ' became a best-seller nationwide when they were published five years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massaquoi 's book massaquoi was one of the few blacks that lived in nazi germany .
unsurprisingly given the nazis ' intolerance of minorities , he experienced rejection from the hitlerjugend -lrb- hitler youth movement -rrb- as well as the local playground after learning they were not open to ' non-aryans ' . " the nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
there were parades , fireworks and uniforms - these were the devices by which hitler won over young people to his ideas .
hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , germany 's youth belonged to him . " after the bombs started falling on hamburg in 1943 , massaquoi and his mother were rejected entry to a bomb shelter after they tried to seek refuge .
it was this particular moment more than any other which stayed with him as his life took him away from the country of his birth . after the war , he emigrated to the united states , serving two years in the army as a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division .
he studied journalism at the university of illinois , followed by a career at jet magazine and then ebony magazine , where he became managing editor . grandson of the liberian consul general to hamburg , massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well-to-do african father and a german mother .
his early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat . his circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to liberia in 1929 .
refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , his mother chose instead to raise her son in germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
suddenly he was not something special , he was something strange . re-living the past now that life as an anomoly in his home nation is being shown for the first time on german television . massaquoi said it was a shock to visit the set where his story was being produced and the memories that flooded back were " incredibly sad . " " my whole life i have tried to put my dark past behind me , " he said .
" but this television production has confronted me with unsettling memories of my childhood in nazi germany in 1935 that i had thought i had come to terms with . " brutal treatment of blacks in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacks had few rights and were excluded from the military in contrast to german jews or german roma , massaquoi was not persecuted .
he was ' just ' a second-class citizen , which was actually a blessing in disguise .
during world war ii , his ' impurity ' spared him from being drafted into the german army . historically , the separation of whites and blacks was mandated by the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- , which in turn , enacted the outlawing of mixed marriages in the african colonies , according to the united states holocaust memorial museum website . african german mulatto children were marginalized in german society and completely isolated from university education , jobs including military service , social activities and economic support . " with the nazi rise to power they became a target of racial and population policy .
by 1937 , the gestapo -lrb- german secret state police -rrb- had secretly rounded up and forcibly sterilized many of them .
some were subjected to medical experiments ; others mysteriously ' disappeared ' , " the website further explains . however , massaquoi , who now lives in new orleans , is still positive about returning to germany : " it 's always a home-coming for me .
you ca n't believe how happy and proud i am that my story is being done for television . " he added : ' ' it is so very important for young germans to understand how precious freedom is .

cooper standard automotives plans to close its plant by december 2007 , transferring the work to france and poland , according to bridgend council .
in a statement , the council said it understood the reason for the planned closure was reduced customer demand .
the council and the welsh assembly government said they were " disappointed " to learn of the closure .
bridgend council leader , councillor cheryl green , said : " this is sad news for the employees and their families .
" basically jobs are being moved elsewhere in europe and this is happening unfortunately all over now , " she added .
" this is just the last in a series of manufacturing jobs that have been lost in the bridgend area over the last number of years . "
the council said 246 employees would be affected by the closure .
the company once employed 600 people but has been scaling down for the past 18 months .
an assembly government spokesperson said : " officials from the department for enterprise , innovation and networks have supported the company in a number of areas over the years .
" more recently -lrb- the officials -rrb- have been in dialogue with them regarding the identification and implementation of cost-savings measures through a series of improvement initiatives .
" we are very disappointed with this announcement and will continue to work closely with both the company and the employees to look at what further support can be provided . "
" we need support in maesteg badly to recover from this sort of position " councillor william teesdale ms green said the council would also be doing all it could to help by working with the company and other partners to form a redundancy response team .
the team would informing those directly affected about alternative job opportunities , training options , benefits and other support .
ms green said the company was a " big employer " in the area .
" there 's going to be a big impact on some families - you might even get some families with up to four people working at that plant , " she said .
the plant is in a division of the global company manufacturing weather seals for car windows and doors .
bridgend councillor william teesdale , whose maesteg west ward includes the factory , said : " it 's quite a blow .
it 's a lot of jobs going in a town of this size .
" we need support in maesteg badly to recover from this sort of position .
these are jobs that people do n't have to travel for . "
' job blow ' the welsh conservatives ' economic development spokesman alun cairns said the job losses were worrying .
he added : " this is terrible news .
it 's yet another job blow to a community that depends on these sort of jobs in the manufacturing sector .
" this is extremely worrying because it takes us beyond the number of 3,000 manufacturing jobs lost since the wda were wound up earlier this year .
" if this pattern continues our manufacturing sector wo n't exist for much longer . "
responding to mr cairns ' claim 3,000 jobs have been lost since the wda was merged into the assembly government , enterprise minister andrew davies said : " official figures show employment in wales is at a record high , including many hi-tech jobs .
" however , we do not take any job losses lightly . "

the 24-year-old woman was murdered and her partially-clothed body wrapped in a duvet and left in a car park in ballymena two weeks ago .
at the funeral mass , father johnny doherty said the young woman had " been brutally murdered and then dumped like trash " .
ms finley was buried from st gerard 's , the same church where she was baptised .
the flowers and wreaths included those from her two foster families and her birth family , and two large floral arrangements , one spelling out shirley 's name , the other ' friend ' .
shirley , from crebilly road , ballymena , was found strangled in mount street car park on 19 september .
detectives said a sexual motive was one of their main lines of inquiry .
police want to hear from anyone who may have seen shirley in the harryville area on monday 18 september with a tall , dark haired man in his late 20s or early 30s .
they are also looking for her footwear and her jeans or black track bottoms .
police have printed posters and leaflets with ms finlay 's photograph to raise public awareness .
a mobile police station is also in operation at the mount street car park where her body was found .
in the photograph issued of ms finlay , she has dark hair , but when she was last seen alive , her hair had been dyed blonde .
she was 5ft tall , of slim to average build and was wearing a grey fleece , black trouser bottoms and , possibly , trainers .
ms finlay has been described as a woman who had mental health problems and who regularly walked alone in ballymena .
police have described her murder as " brutal " .

" if we were not with you , you wo n't manage anything , " said president pervez musharraf in a bbc radio 4 interview .
he said the taleban , not al-qaeda , was now the focus of the struggle against militancy in the region .
" the greatest danger today is if the taleban movement gets converted into a people 's movement , " he warned .
earlier this week tony blair assured gen musharraf a leaked paper condemning pakistan 's intelligence service did not reflect his government 's view .
in the leaked report , a naval commander at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- claimed pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , had indirectly helped the taleban and al-qaeda .
in the bbc interview mr musharraf rejected these claims and said isi 's support was vital .
if we were not with you , you wo n't manage anything president pervez musharraf " you 'll be brought down to your knees if pakistan does n't co-operate with you .
that is all that i would like to say .
pakistan is the main ally .
if we were not with you , you wo n't manage anything , " he said .
" let that be clear .
and if isi is not with you , you will fail . "
' historic debt ' he also claims the us and britain had a historic debt to pay as pakistan had helped " win the cold war " for the west .
he argued that the west 's strategy in afghanistan towards the end of the cold war helped to create the conditions which led to al-qaeda 's rise .
president musharraf said mujahideen fighters went into the area from all over the world and the west armed and trained the taleban .
he said pakistan was then left " high and dry " .
his comments develop arguments he has made over the past few days at meetings with us president george w bush and tony blair and a speech given in oxford .
gen musharraf said the pakistani government 's aim in the country 's tribal border areas was to " wean the people away " from supporting the taleban , pointing out that while al-qaeda was mainly comprised of " foreigners " , the taleban 's support was more locally based .
he denied the suggestion that the tribal elders with whom the government has forged a recent agreement are a front for the taleban .
he said the tribal elders were the " only way " to establish support from the local population : " the army can not get them on our side " .
' disappearances ' denied gen musharraf also strongly denied allegations by the human rights organisation amnesty international that some alleged terror suspects had vanished without trace .
" i do n't want even to reply to that , it is a nonsense , i do n't believe it , i do n't trust it , " he said .

" if we were not with you , you wo n't manage anything , " said president pervez musharraf in a bbc radio 4 interview .
he said the taleban , not al-qaeda , was now the focus of the struggle against militancy in the region .
" the greatest danger today is if the taleban movement gets converted into a people 's movement , " he warned .
earlier this week tony blair assured gen musharraf a leaked paper condemning pakistan 's intelligence service did not reflect his government 's view .
in the leaked report , a naval commander at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- claimed pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , had indirectly helped the taleban and al-qaeda .
in the bbc interview mr musharraf rejected these claims and said isi 's support was vital .
if we were not with you , you wo n't manage anything president pervez musharraf " you 'll be brought down to your knees if pakistan does n't co-operate with you .
that is all that i would like to say .
pakistan is the main ally .
if we were not with you , you wo n't manage anything , " he said .
" let that be clear .
and if isi is not with you , you will fail . "
' historic debt ' he also claims the us and britain had a historic debt to pay as pakistan had helped " win the cold war " for the west .
he argued that the west 's strategy in afghanistan towards the end of the cold war helped to create the conditions which led to al-qaeda 's rise .
president musharraf said mujahideen fighters went into the area from all over the world and the west armed and trained the taleban .
he said pakistan was then left " high and dry " .
his comments develop arguments he has made over the past few days at meetings with us president george w bush and tony blair and a speech given in oxford .
gen musharraf said the pakistani government 's aim in the country 's tribal border areas was to " wean the people away " from supporting the taleban , pointing out that while al-qaeda was mainly comprised of " foreigners " , the taleban 's support was more locally based .
he denied the suggestion that the tribal elders with whom the government has forged a recent agreement are a front for the taleban .
he said the tribal elders were the " only way " to establish support from the local population : " the army can not get them on our side " .
' disappearances ' denied gen musharraf also strongly denied allegations by the human rights organisation amnesty international that some alleged terror suspects had vanished without trace .
" i do n't want even to reply to that , it is a nonsense , i do n't believe it , i do n't trust it , " he said .
have your say pakistan has put all its efforts towards the eradication of terrorism maryam shahbaz , sialkot , pakistan send us your views gen musharraf said the authorities had detained some 700 people , but all of them were accounted for .
of the leaked mod paper , british defence officials claimed it was written by a junior official , was unfinished and had not been seen by anyone who actually makes government policy .
after two hours of talks on thursday downing street said gen musharraf had accepted mr blair 's reassurances .

as if to reinforce his message , the country 's annual crime statistics have shown a sharp rise in some areas of violent crime .
forty years ago this september , i set foot here for the first time .
my parents had chosen to leave britain and move to south africa .
nelson mandela had only just begun serving his long prison sentence then .
but i knew nothing of that as our ship passed robben island on its way into cape town on a fine spring morning .
assassination it had taken two weeks to sail from southampton , and the voyage had not been without drama .
while we were at sea , news reached the ship that the south african prime minister - hendrik verwoerd - one of the key architects of apartheid , had been assassinated in parliament . "
perhaps we did n't realise just how apartheid damaged us so that we seem to have lost our sense of right and wrong " archbishop desmond tutu he was stabbed to death by a deranged messenger .
it was not - so it appeared - a political killing .
a memorial service was immediately held on board the ship , and as the south african passengers proudly and robustly sang their national anthem - die stem - i had my first taste of what it would be like growing up in white south africa .
the late 1960s was a time when opposition to apartheid had been well and truly crushed by the state .
mandela and his colleagues were languishing in jail , or in exile .
most white south africans cared little about the morality of segregation .
for that was the way it had always been - and the way it would stay for the foreseeable future .
whites were concerned though , when international sports boycotts began to cast them into isolation .
sport had always mattered far more than politics .
this should have been a deeply impressionable time for a teenager .
but i can not over-emphasise the degree of insulation that there was then .
the apartheid state was at its zenith .
whites and blacks were not meant to mix .
the state wanted recent history forgotten , and so it was that as i entered university , i 'd never heard of nelson mandela or the sharpeville shootings of 1960 .
unbelievable now , but not unusual then .
' powder keg ' poverty so let 's fast forward to the present .
south africa 's democracy is now 12 years old , still young and somewhat fragile .
apartheid is history , and nelson mandela , has overseen one of the most remarkable periods of political transition anywhere in the world .
the former president and master of reconciliation is now 88 years old and enjoying a happy retirement .
but for another south african nobel peace prize laureate , archbishop desmond tutu , all is not well in the new south africa .
when i met him a few months ago , he told me of his concern about the demeaning levels of poverty that many people still face .
this - he said - was a powder keg .
and many white south africans did not realise how lucky they were .
now , desmond tutu has raised new issues .
he is worried about crime - the high murder rate , the rape of children , and the cold-blooded , gratuitous killing of motorists whose cars are hijacked .
" what 's happened to us ? " he asked .
" perhaps we did n't realise just how apartheid damaged us so that we seem to have lost our sense of right and wrong . "
as a result perhaps , it is easy to take for granted , the rather extraordinary surroundings in a big city like johannesburg .
for those who can afford it , there are high walls and electrified fences around their properties .
alarm systems and armed response teams supposedly provide another layer of protection against the criminals .
people drive with their car doors locked and their windows closed .
the other day , we had a major power-cut across northern jo 'burg .
as traffic lights failed , and queues began to build up , a local radio station gave a timely warning about the increased danger of " smash and grab " incidents at road intersections .
' scintillating success ' as i went into my local bank this week , i was struck by the way in which south africa still reverses the norms of society .
yes , there are two security doors on the way in , but you often have to queue to get out of the bank .
for all the obvious reasons , only one person at a time may leave the building .
i am relieved to say that crime is no longer the first topic of conversation at suburban dinner tables , as it was a decade ago .
but it is undoubtedly , a big problem , and the police are struggling .
many white south africans , in particular , continue to whinge about it .
in parliament recently , the safety and security minister controversially told some of the " whingers " - in this case , a group of opposition mps - that they could leave the country if they did not like it .
of course , black south africans were the victims of crime , long before it reached the white suburbs .
add to that the domestic violence against women and children , that is still one of the most alarming facets of daily life here .
so desmond tutu 's latest remarks about the state of the nation have certainly struck a chord , giving cause for concern about the future .
he makes it clear he thinks south africa is a wonderful country , but says : " we are a scintillating success , waiting to happen " .

whites were concerned though , when international sports boycotts began to cast them into isolation .
sport had always mattered far more than politics .
this should have been a deeply impressionable time for a teenager .
but i can not over-emphasise the degree of insulation that there was then .
the apartheid state was at its zenith .
whites and blacks were not meant to mix .
the state wanted recent history forgotten , and so it was that as i entered university , i 'd never heard of nelson mandela or the sharpeville shootings of 1960 .
unbelievable now , but not unusual then .
' powder keg ' poverty so let 's fast forward to the present .
south africa 's democracy is now 12 years old , still young and somewhat fragile .
apartheid is history , and nelson mandela , has overseen one of the most remarkable periods of political transition anywhere in the world .
the former president and master of reconciliation is now 88 years old and enjoying a happy retirement .
nelson mandela oversaw south africa 's political transition but for another south african nobel peace prize laureate , archbishop desmond tutu , all is not well in the new south africa .
when i met him a few months ago , he told me of his concern about the demeaning levels of poverty that many people still face .
this - he said - was a powder keg .
and many white south africans did not realise how lucky they were .
now , desmond tutu has raised new issues .
he is worried about crime - the high murder rate , the rape of children , and the cold-blooded , gratuitous killing of motorists whose cars are hijacked .
" what 's happened to us ? " he asked .
" perhaps we did n't realise just how apartheid damaged us so that we seem to have lost our sense of right and wrong . "
as a result perhaps , it is easy to take for granted , the rather extraordinary surroundings in a big city like johannesburg .
for those who can afford it , there are high walls and electrified fences around their properties .
alarm systems and armed response teams supposedly provide another layer of protection against the criminals .
people drive with their car doors locked and their windows closed .
the other day , we had a major power-cut across northern jo 'burg .
as traffic lights failed , and queues began to build up , a local radio station gave a timely warning about the increased danger of " smash and grab " incidents at road intersections .
' scintillating success ' as i went into my local bank this week , i was struck by the way in which south africa still reverses the norms of society .
yes , there are two security doors on the way in , but you often have to queue to get out of the bank .
for all the obvious reasons , only one person at a time may leave the building .
i am relieved to say that crime is no longer the first topic of conversation at suburban dinner tables , as it was a decade ago .
but it is undoubtedly , a big problem , and the police are struggling .
many white south africans , in particular , continue to whinge about it .
in parliament recently , the safety and security minister controversially told some of the " whingers " - in this case , a group of opposition mps - that they could leave the country if they did not like it .
of course , black south africans were the victims of crime , long before it reached the white suburbs .
add to that the domestic violence against women and children , that is still one of the most alarming facets of daily life here .
so desmond tutu 's latest remarks about the state of the nation have certainly struck a chord , giving cause for concern about the future .
he makes it clear he thinks south africa is a wonderful country , but says : " we are a scintillating success , waiting to happen " .

" pat mclaughlin " - real name peter tobin , 60 - was taken in by fr nugent and given odd jobs to do about six weeks ago .
in st patrick 's he met ms kluk , 23 , who had been living in the church during a working holiday to fund her studies in gdansk .
tobin is a registered sex offender .
he had raped a 14-year-old girl .
he was the last man seen with ms kluk .
st patrick 's hit the headlines last week when two failed asylum seekers sought refuge in the church .
it operated a support group for asylum seekers called a voice for the voiceless .
' last refuge ' masih raymond , 49 , and his wife christine , 45 , faced deportation to pakistan but sought sanctuary with fr nugent .
he said he had taken them in on humanitarian grounds .
angelika kluk was due to return to poland on monday " i ca n't turn my back on them , " he said .
" i have to stand by the right thing to do . "
the consulate general of pakistan in glasgow , shah m jamal , said the case showed places of worship were often viewed as the last refuge .
a week later , this refuge was back in the news when it was announced angelika kluk had disappeared from the church .
her sister aneta , 28 , said her disappearance was completely out of character .
she spoke of a friendly , trustworthy and reliable person who was responsible beyond her 23 years .
ms kluk had bought her return ticket home .
police were mystified and concerned .
she left without clothing , id cards or house keys , they said .
they immediately turned their focus to pat mclaughlin and appealed for him to contact them .
his true identity was then revealed and the fact a warrant was outstanding for his arrest .
' places of sanctuary ' at 2000 bst on friday police found a body concealed at st patrick 's church .
questions will be asked on what the police did in the five days between ms kluk 's disappearance on sunday and the discovery of a body on friday .
the spotlight will also turn to the open door policy operated by churches and how a registered sex offender could gain work as an odd job man .
one local in anderston , who did not want to be named , said : " they let anyone in , they should try to find out who they are first . "
masih and christine raymond inside st patrick 's church revered neil galbraith , minister at old cathcart parish church and chief executive of glasgow the caring city , said anyone working in a church should be police checked .
he said : " they should be police checked before they have any contact with the church and its people .
" people do see churches as places of sanctuary , i have had a knife held to my throat .
" we work with other agencies and to find accommodation for 24 hours while we check them . "
it is complex to determine exactly how a place of worship can continue to provide refuge in good faith alone .
the horrific reality of the situation is conveyed by ronnie convery of the glasgow 's roman catholic archdiocese .
he said : " the idea that a body could be found in or around a church almost defies belief . "
