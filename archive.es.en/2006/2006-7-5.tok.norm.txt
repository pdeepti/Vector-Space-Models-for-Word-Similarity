program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2006 betting to win billions in the grey zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the legality of the current sports betting monopoly is being questioned germany and the world are still caught up in soccer fever .
but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .

only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .
that could effectively mean the containment and restriction of gambling as a result of the june court decision . want to bet that the sports betting conflict will last a while longer ? marcel fürstenau -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sport betting stays in state hands in a decision that delighted local german sports officials and disappointed the private sector , germany 's highest court ruled against breaking up the state monopoly on sports gambling .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come .

one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .

" the close defeat does n't hurt , " the paper said , " because the german team achieved so much . "
" these players did n't just come out ahead of strong nations such as brazil , argentina , and the netherlands - their appearances were also really enjoyable .
they also changed the people in this country , at least for three and a half weeks , leaving them happier , more relaxed and more confident . " " we 're crying with you , " read the headline in the popular tabloid bild zeitu n g , " but you 're still heroes ! "
the paper was full of encouragement after the bitter defeat , and full of confidence that germany " will take third place on saturday , and not complain ... to klinsi and all the boys , we say , thank you for this wonderful world cup .
what has grown in the last couple of weeks will remain .
the germans have re-discovered a love for their country and their team , " bild wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach jürgen klinsmann : what does his future hold ?
the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .
" thanks to klinsmann , german soccer gained an unexpected easiness and a new perspective .
not to use this , to let the flame die , would be a much greater loss than the defeat in the semi-final match - with or without klinsmann . " outside germany , britain 's daily mirror commented on the italian team , saying that tuesday 's victory would go a long way in redeeming italy in the wake of the soccer corruption scandal that " infected the soul of the nation ... they came as the pariahs of the world , the men who represented everything that football wants to forget about the dark side of the beautiful game , " the paper wrote .
" but on sunday , it is italy who will march into berlin 's olympic stadium , their chests puffed out with pride , their honor restored , their courage rewarded . " the guardia n of london commented that germany has been " brusquely shaken awake from its world cup dream , " but said that the team can hold their heads high .
" throughout the world cup they played intelligent , aggressive football , " the paper said , adding that tuesday 's game could have gone either way .
" afterwards there were tears in the westfalenstadion and across the country , but better this death than meek surrender . " sweden 's afto n bladet was pleased with the match , praising both sides .
" italy came to the world cup as the object of hatred and has now achieved more than anyone could have dreamed , " the paper wrote .
" the italians played for their honor , the germans for a nation in ecstasy .
finally , a world cup match that met the greatest of expectations . " and as to be expected , italy 's press was full of praise for the men in blue .
" wonderful italy , " wrote rome 's la stampa .

" we 've already beaten portugal but i 'm not into statistics , that 's history , this is 2006 , the reality is on wednesday night , " domenech said . france 's magical quarter-final win over brazil has sent belief that a second world cup crown in eight years is suddenly within touching distance after looking a distant dream during a shaky first round . domenech 's priority before wednesday is to get his side off of cloud nine and focused on the job of beating portugal .
" the danger for us now is to think we 've done it by beating brazil , we 've got to get the players back to where they were before that win , " domenech said . " we 've achieved something super ... but our work is not finished , we ca n't let up .
for me success at this world cup only comes if we win . " impe n di n g retireme n t drives zida n e to eve n greater heights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curtain wo n't come down on the zizou show just yet if zidane 's demeanor after saturday 's victory over the brazilians is anything to go by , domenech can rely on his captain to reinforce the message . while many of his team-mates celebrated , zidane permitted himself a smile of satisfaction and handshakes all round before leaving the pitch swiftly , as if already preparing himself mentally for the tasks ahead . with his retirement looming after the finals , zidane is determined to scale the peak that he achieved in 1998 , when he scored twice as brazil were beaten 3-0 in a memorable final in paris . according to domenech , it is his captain 's pending departure from the game that is behind his renaissance .
" i think it 's precisely because he is retiring , because he is ending his career , that he 's fully focused on the game , " domenech said . " now he does n't have to calculate anything .
he can play with freedom and expression , because he knows every game could be his last .
that is the reason why he 's able to play so well . " physical portugal a risk for carded fre n ch domenech 's biggest worry is the fact that no fewer than six of his expected starting line-up - zidane , willy sagnol , louis saha , lilian thuram , patrick vieira and franck ribery - go into the match on a yellow card . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's players have given no quarter with portugal having shown themselves to be adept at bringing the worst out of their opponents over the last two rounds , where both england and holland had players sent off against them , that will be a concern for domenech . " they are a quality side who have proved capable of imposing their style of play on their rivals , " said domenech .
" i do n't know scolari but i think he 's world champion is n't he ? " scolari , who coached brazil to the 2002 world cup , will be buoyed by the return from suspension of midfield playmaker deco and his minder costinha . the master motivator , scolari has urged his team to create history by becoming the first portuguese side to reach the world cup final in only their fourth tournament . history becko n s for scolari 's " warrior " team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal coach scolari has instilled a warrior spirit " we had the chance to create a piece of history at the 2004 european championship and we did n't take it , " said scolari , referring to portugal 's failure to win their first major tournament on home soil two years ago .
" now we have got another chance to make history at the world cup . " scolari has put his team 's progression through the tournament down to a new-found ' warrior spirit ' that has been grafted on to portugal 's long tradition of technical excellence . " the spirit of this team is remarkable , " scolari said .
" this is a new portugal team and it 's a new spirit .

media commentators criticized coach jurgen klinsmann as the team suffered a series of pre-match defeats . but that was before a string of wins in the world cup matches threw the normally cautious and skeptical german nature out the door . so it was that much more bitter when on tuesday , italy beat germany 2-0 in last minute goals . " it is very sad to end like this , because we really thought germany could do it now , " matthias brucker , standing in dortmund 's friedenplatz , told the bbc . others hailed the team 's surprisingly long run .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2006 opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll get another chance to cheer july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .
but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .
i watched a young woman stroke a neatly folded german flag in her lap as she glanced at her downbeat boyfriend with worried eyes .
i watched a grumpy teenager in his original german team soccer jersey , who looked like he was ready to punch someone until his father told him to look at an advertisement on the window behind him . " jesus rettet , " it read .
jesus saves . germa n y 's lesso n the teen chuckled and suddenly it dawned on me .
while germany 's fourth of july might have been incredibly painful , it could teach the country a lesson that 's much more important than winning the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even michael ballack could n't help but cry which lesson ?
that it 's okay to lose , especially after giving it your best - both on the pitch and on the streets .
that germans seem to have won something that 's much more important than the short-lived joy of a weltmeister title : the ability to celebrate their team and their country without making others feel threatened by a new-found , friendly patriotism . last night , the streets fell silent .
they lacked the honking concerts that followed the recent victories of germany 's soccer team .
but this morning , the black , red and yellow flags were still flying atop cars and germans were looking forward to cheering for their guys in their final world cup game for third place on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to disappear from germany 's streets any time soon " now more than ever , " read the shirt that one tv commentator put on after tuesday 's match .
he praised " our " performance and said that germany 's young team has a bright future ahead . as far as i know , the european championships are coming up in 2008 .
let 's try that for starters .
i 'll be watching .
and i 'll keep my fingers crossed . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : chin up , germany european editorials on wednesday commented on germany 's dramatic loss to italy in tuesday 's world cup semi-final match , with most papers giving germany a sympathetic pat on the back for a job well done .
-lrb- june 5 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .

but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .
i watched a young woman stroke a neatly folded german flag in her lap as she glanced at her downbeat boyfriend with worried eyes .
i watched a grumpy teenager in his original german team soccer jersey , who looked like he was ready to punch someone until his father told him to look at an advertisement on the window behind him . " jesus rettet , " it read .
jesus saves . germa n y 's lesso n the teen chuckled and suddenly it dawned on me .
while germany 's fourth of july might have been incredibly painful , it could teach the country a lesson that 's much more important than winning the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even michael ballack could n't help but cry which lesson ?
that it 's okay to lose , especially after giving it your best - both on the pitch and on the streets .
that germans seem to have won something that 's much more important than the short-lived joy of a weltmeister title : the ability to celebrate their team and their country without making others feel threatened by a new-found , friendly patriotism . last night , the streets fell silent .
they lacked the honking concerts that followed the recent victories of germany 's soccer team .
but this morning , the black , red and yellow flags were still flying atop cars and germans were looking forward to cheering for their guys in their final world cup game for third place on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to disappear from germany 's streets any time soon " now more than ever , " read the shirt that one tv commentator put on after tuesday 's match .
he praised " our " performance and said that germany 's young team has a bright future ahead . as far as i know , the european championships are coming up in 2008 .

" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .

for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come .

the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .

" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic finland sets a real example for other european countries as one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in europe .
and they lead most significantly in providing an effective education system and care for their children .
finland has just taken over the eu presidency and they have a lot on their plate in this crisis-filled time .
but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2006 betting to win billions in the grey zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the legality of the current sports betting monopoly is being questioned germany and the world are still caught up in soccer fever .
but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .
that could effectively mean the containment and restriction of gambling as a result of the june court decision . want to bet that the sports betting conflict will last a while longer ? marcel fürstenau -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sport betting stays in state hands in a decision that delighted local german sports officials and disappointed the private sector , germany 's highest court ruled against breaking up the state monopoly on sports gambling .

now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 . the headlines calling for klinsmann 's head after a loss to italy in an exhibition match in march were clear . " inexperienced and overwhelmed " and " get rid of klinsi ! " were among the most unambiguous . now , after a trip to the semi-finals and another loss to italy , no one is willing to let go of the trainer who the nation 's parliament called in to explain his plan for germany 's soccer team , and the papers are glowing . " you 're still our heroes " and " soccer reformer klinsmann should stay " both make the popular case for klinsmann to remain with the german team . becke n bauer cha n ges his tu n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will klinsmann walk away from the german team after the semi-final loss ?
even one of his harshest critics , german soccer legend and world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer - who wanted the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to have a replacement for klinsmann on the " back burner " before germany lost tuesday night to italy - said it would be a shame for klinsmann to leave the german team after bringing in so many young players to create what klinsmann himself called the " new face of german soccer . " " i hope very much that he stays , " beckenbauer said .
" he has young players who trust him and who he trusts .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .
that could effectively mean the containment and restriction of gambling as a result of the june court decision . want to bet that the sports betting conflict will last a while longer ? marcel fürstenau -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sport betting stays in state hands in a decision that delighted local german sports officials and disappointed the private sector , germany 's highest court ruled against breaking up the state monopoly on sports gambling .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .

either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization .

" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .

" it is going for 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 1,900 -rrb- at the moment , " a dealer who declined to give his name said in munich where france and portugal were playing each other on tuesday night for a place in the final against italy . the young man , who says he started selling tickets even before the championship kicked off here on june 9 , was offering last-minute tickets for the semi-final for 600 euros a pair . a second trader confirmed that a ticket for the final would cost " at least 1,500 euros " . by sunday though , they said , the price for tickets to berlin 's olympic stadium will have dropped dramatically to about 600 euros a piece . though fifa has tried to avoid black-marketeering by printing spectators ' names on their tickets , the dealers said the system was far from foolproof because tens of thousands of people attended each match . " it is not possible to check because of the sheer size of the crowds , " the first dealer told afp . he said he has done a roaring trade during the tournament and that his best customers were mexican fans followed by the english and argentineans .
" one day i made 12,000 euros .
that was with the mexicans .
they come from far but they are also the biggest spenders .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .

but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .
i watched a young woman stroke a neatly folded german flag in her lap as she glanced at her downbeat boyfriend with worried eyes .
i watched a grumpy teenager in his original german team soccer jersey , who looked like he was ready to punch someone until his father told him to look at an advertisement on the window behind him . " jesus rettet , " it read .
jesus saves . germa n y 's lesso n the teen chuckled and suddenly it dawned on me .
while germany 's fourth of july might have been incredibly painful , it could teach the country a lesson that 's much more important than winning the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even michael ballack could n't help but cry which lesson ?
that it 's okay to lose , especially after giving it your best - both on the pitch and on the streets .
that germans seem to have won something that 's much more important than the short-lived joy of a weltmeister title : the ability to celebrate their team and their country without making others feel threatened by a new-found , friendly patriotism . last night , the streets fell silent .
they lacked the honking concerts that followed the recent victories of germany 's soccer team .
but this morning , the black , red and yellow flags were still flying atop cars and germans were looking forward to cheering for their guys in their final world cup game for third place on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to disappear from germany 's streets any time soon " now more than ever , " read the shirt that one tv commentator put on after tuesday 's match .
he praised " our " performance and said that germany 's young team has a bright future ahead . as far as i know , the european championships are coming up in 2008 .
let 's try that for starters .
i 'll be watching .
and i 'll keep my fingers crossed . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : chin up , germany european editorials on wednesday commented on germany 's dramatic loss to italy in tuesday 's world cup semi-final match , with most papers giving germany a sympathetic pat on the back for a job well done .

media commentators criticized coach jurgen klinsmann as the team suffered a series of pre-match defeats . but that was before a string of wins in the world cup matches threw the normally cautious and skeptical german nature out the door . so it was that much more bitter when on tuesday , italy beat germany 2-0 in last minute goals .

the fan mile has been one of the abiding successes of this world cup , and had to be extended ahead of the match . during the final minutes of the game , the area was eerily quiet .
after the winning goals , some cried , others applauded , most waved flags . " we are still proud of them , " lukas schmidt , 18 , told dpa .

i ca n't believe it now - maybe tomorrow when i wake up .
i can think only of sunday now . " " the germans can go home but we 're going to party - we 're going to drink their beer and eat their sausages , " he added .
" it 's great to celebrate in germany after beating germany .

we have beaten the germans , they will boycott our pizzas , but we have the taste and flavour of victory . " keep the feeli n g while football legend franz beckenbauer said he hoped that germans would stay in an upbeat mood regardless , president horst köhler added that he hoped that germans would sustain the new-found patriotism they discovered during the tournament , when for the first time since the war waving german flags and singing the national anthem were accepted as natural gestures of healthy national pride . " we are on the right track toward standing up for ourselves and taking pride in what we have achieved since 1945 , " he told bild .
" the germans identify with this country and its national colors .
i think that is terrific . " he added that the country could still seek strength in the unexpected winning streak that took it to the semi-finals . " we can achieve a lot if we have the courage to dare to do something new , " he said .

media commentators criticized coach jurgen klinsmann as the team suffered a series of pre-match defeats . but that was before a string of wins in the world cup matches threw the normally cautious and skeptical german nature out the door . so it was that much more bitter when on tuesday , italy beat germany 2-0 in last minute goals . " it is very sad to end like this , because we really thought germany could do it now , " matthias brucker , standing in dortmund 's friedenplatz , told the bbc . others hailed the team 's surprisingly long run .

" we are on the right track toward standing up for ourselves and taking pride in what we have achieved since 1945 , " he told bild .
" the germans identify with this country and its national colors .
i think that is terrific . " he added that the country could still seek strength in the unexpected winning streak that took it to the semi-finals . " we can achieve a lot if we have the courage to dare to do something new , " he said .

" the close defeat does n't hurt , " the paper said , " because the german team achieved so much . "
" these players did n't just come out ahead of strong nations such as brazil , argentina , and the netherlands - their appearances were also really enjoyable .
they also changed the people in this country , at least for three and a half weeks , leaving them happier , more relaxed and more confident . " " we 're crying with you , " read the headline in the popular tabloid bild zeitu n g , " but you 're still heroes ! "
the paper was full of encouragement after the bitter defeat , and full of confidence that germany " will take third place on saturday , and not complain ... to klinsi and all the boys , we say , thank you for this wonderful world cup .

the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .

" throughout the world cup they played intelligent , aggressive football , " the paper said , adding that tuesday 's game could have gone either way .
" afterwards there were tears in the westfalenstadion and across the country , but better this death than meek surrender . " sweden 's afto n bladet was pleased with the match , praising both sides .
" italy came to the world cup as the object of hatred and has now achieved more than anyone could have dreamed , " the paper wrote .

but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .

zinedine zidane 's penalty was enough to put france in sunday 's final against italy . zinedine zidane fired france into their second world cup final appearance in eight years in munich on wednesday , scoring the only goal in a 1-0 semi-final victory over portugal . the french captain shattered portugal 's dreams of a first ever appearance in the final after coolly converting a hotly disputed penalty midway through the first half at the 62,000-seat allianz arena . zidane 's goal was a repeat of his spot-kick winner against the portuguese in the semi-finals of euro 2000 and sent france into a final on sunday against italy - just as it had done six years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricardo picked the right side but could n't stop zizou scoring but the decider was shrouded in controversy , with portugal protesting uruguayan referee jorge larrionda 's decision to point to the spot after chelsea defender ricardo carvalho brought down thierry henry just inside the area . a clever touch by henry wrong-footed carvalho who fell but stuck his leg out , and although the arsenal star reacted theatrically to clear contact , larrionda had no hesitation in pointing to the spot . portuguese goalkeeper ricardo had saved three penalties in his side 's shoot-out victory over england in the quarter-finals on saturday but though he dived the right way zidane 's 33rd-minute spot kick gave him no chance , buried majestically into the corner . france , the 1998 champions , spent much of the remainder of the game on the back foot as portugal searched desperately for an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's former galactico figo was shut out but despite dominating territory and possession much of the second half , portugal were unable to find a way through a french defense superbly marshaled by lilian thuram and william gallas . luis figo missed a glorious chance to equalize when he headed over on 78 minutes after a cristiano ronaldo free-kick that french keeper fabien barthez spilled comically . a furious late rally saw portugal camped in french territory but les bleus held firm to keep their dream of a second title alive . the match had threatened to boil over towards the end of the first half when portugal had a penalty appeal of their own waved away . ronaldo - booed whenever he touched the ball in the first half - leapt for a cross and fell over french defender willy sagnol . portugal coach luiz felipe scolari and the entire portugal bench were out of the dug-out in protest but referee larrionda was having none of it , and replays showed there was no contact whatsoever . an entertaining opening 45 minutes saw both sides go close early on ; dispelling fears the match would be a tense affair with five players from each team starting on a yellow card . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were few clear chances in the tight game portugal , who had welcomed the return from suspension of midfield enforcer costinha and barcelona playmaker deco , were quickly into their stride with ronaldo looking menacing down the left . both deco and figo forced barthez into scrambled saves in the opening 15 minutes , while midfielder maniche saw a shot fly millimeters over the bar . yet though portugal had the clearer chances , france did not appear to be unduly troubled , their back four restricting their opponents to long-range efforts only . ronaldo , who has been demonized in england this week for his part in the dismissal of wayne rooney last weekend , was singled out as the pantomime villain by french and neutral fans immediately . boos and whistles greeted the manchester united winger 's every touch and he enraged france coach raymond domenech on the half-hour , the french coach accusing him of attempting to con the referee with a dive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de zinedine zidane : the making of a soccer legend it started in a marseille ghetto before weaving its way through europe , gathering riches on the way .

zinedine zidane 's penalty was enough to put france in sunday 's final against italy . zinedine zidane fired france into their second world cup final appearance in eight years in munich on wednesday , scoring the only goal in a 1-0 semi-final victory over portugal . the french captain shattered portugal 's dreams of a first ever appearance in the final after coolly converting a hotly disputed penalty midway through the first half at the 62,000-seat allianz arena . zidane 's goal was a repeat of his spot-kick winner against the portuguese in the semi-finals of euro 2000 and sent france into a final on sunday against italy - just as it had done six years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricardo picked the right side but could n't stop zizou scoring but the decider was shrouded in controversy , with portugal protesting uruguayan referee jorge larrionda 's decision to point to the spot after chelsea defender ricardo carvalho brought down thierry henry just inside the area . a clever touch by henry wrong-footed carvalho who fell but stuck his leg out , and although the arsenal star reacted theatrically to clear contact , larrionda had no hesitation in pointing to the spot . portuguese goalkeeper ricardo had saved three penalties in his side 's shoot-out victory over england in the quarter-finals on saturday but though he dived the right way zidane 's 33rd-minute spot kick gave him no chance , buried majestically into the corner . france , the 1998 champions , spent much of the remainder of the game on the back foot as portugal searched desperately for an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's former galactico figo was shut out but despite dominating territory and possession much of the second half , portugal were unable to find a way through a french defense superbly marshaled by lilian thuram and william gallas . luis figo missed a glorious chance to equalize when he headed over on 78 minutes after a cristiano ronaldo free-kick that french keeper fabien barthez spilled comically . a furious late rally saw portugal camped in french territory but les bleus held firm to keep their dream of a second title alive . the match had threatened to boil over towards the end of the first half when portugal had a penalty appeal of their own waved away . ronaldo - booed whenever he touched the ball in the first half - leapt for a cross and fell over french defender willy sagnol . portugal coach luiz felipe scolari and the entire portugal bench were out of the dug-out in protest but referee larrionda was having none of it , and replays showed there was no contact whatsoever . an entertaining opening 45 minutes saw both sides go close early on ; dispelling fears the match would be a tense affair with five players from each team starting on a yellow card . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were few clear chances in the tight game portugal , who had welcomed the return from suspension of midfield enforcer costinha and barcelona playmaker deco , were quickly into their stride with ronaldo looking menacing down the left . both deco and figo forced barthez into scrambled saves in the opening 15 minutes , while midfielder maniche saw a shot fly millimeters over the bar . yet though portugal had the clearer chances , france did not appear to be unduly troubled , their back four restricting their opponents to long-range efforts only . ronaldo , who has been demonized in england this week for his part in the dismissal of wayne rooney last weekend , was singled out as the pantomime villain by french and neutral fans immediately . boos and whistles greeted the manchester united winger 's every touch and he enraged france coach raymond domenech on the half-hour , the french coach accusing him of attempting to con the referee with a dive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de zinedine zidane : the making of a soccer legend it started in a marseille ghetto before weaving its way through europe , gathering riches on the way .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .
that could effectively mean the containment and restriction of gambling as a result of the june court decision . want to bet that the sports betting conflict will last a while longer ? marcel fürstenau -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sport betting stays in state hands in a decision that delighted local german sports officials and disappointed the private sector , germany 's highest court ruled against breaking up the state monopoly on sports gambling .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .

" we 've already beaten portugal but i 'm not into statistics , that 's history , this is 2006 , the reality is on wednesday night , " domenech said . france 's magical quarter-final win over brazil has sent belief that a second world cup crown in eight years is suddenly within touching distance after looking a distant dream during a shaky first round . domenech 's priority before wednesday is to get his side off of cloud nine and focused on the job of beating portugal .
" the danger for us now is to think we 've done it by beating brazil , we 've got to get the players back to where they were before that win , " domenech said . " we 've achieved something super ... but our work is not finished , we ca n't let up .
for me success at this world cup only comes if we win . " impe n di n g retireme n t drives zida n e to eve n greater heights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curtain wo n't come down on the zizou show just yet if zidane 's demeanor after saturday 's victory over the brazilians is anything to go by , domenech can rely on his captain to reinforce the message . while many of his team-mates celebrated , zidane permitted himself a smile of satisfaction and handshakes all round before leaving the pitch swiftly , as if already preparing himself mentally for the tasks ahead . with his retirement looming after the finals , zidane is determined to scale the peak that he achieved in 1998 , when he scored twice as brazil were beaten 3-0 in a memorable final in paris . according to domenech , it is his captain 's pending departure from the game that is behind his renaissance .
" i think it 's precisely because he is retiring , because he is ending his career , that he 's fully focused on the game , " domenech said . " now he does n't have to calculate anything .
he can play with freedom and expression , because he knows every game could be his last .
that is the reason why he 's able to play so well . " physical portugal a risk for carded fre n ch domenech 's biggest worry is the fact that no fewer than six of his expected starting line-up - zidane , willy sagnol , louis saha , lilian thuram , patrick vieira and franck ribery - go into the match on a yellow card . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's players have given no quarter with portugal having shown themselves to be adept at bringing the worst out of their opponents over the last two rounds , where both england and holland had players sent off against them , that will be a concern for domenech . " they are a quality side who have proved capable of imposing their style of play on their rivals , " said domenech .
" i do n't know scolari but i think he 's world champion is n't he ? " scolari , who coached brazil to the 2002 world cup , will be buoyed by the return from suspension of midfield playmaker deco and his minder costinha . the master motivator , scolari has urged his team to create history by becoming the first portuguese side to reach the world cup final in only their fourth tournament . history becko n s for scolari 's " warrior " team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal coach scolari has instilled a warrior spirit " we had the chance to create a piece of history at the 2004 european championship and we did n't take it , " said scolari , referring to portugal 's failure to win their first major tournament on home soil two years ago .
" now we have got another chance to make history at the world cup . " scolari has put his team 's progression through the tournament down to a new-found ' warrior spirit ' that has been grafted on to portugal 's long tradition of technical excellence . " the spirit of this team is remarkable , " scolari said .
" this is a new portugal team and it 's a new spirit .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .

but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

the use of star striker miroslav klose also brings attention to the campaign against landmines . the huge banner before millions of television viewers tuned in to the quarter-final matches , was clear : " say no to racism . " between the national anthem and the kick-off , the captains of eight teams , - germany , argentina , italy , ukraine , england , portugal , brazil , and france - read statements from a clipboard condemning racism , using the world cup as a platform to send a message around the globe .
there was even a prescient moment when david beckham 's microphone fizzed out along with england 's hopes , and portugal captain luis figo graciously proffered his own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david beckham 's microphone went out along with england 's hopes never mind that the statements were in part inaudible or issued in a language that most viewers could not understand .
it was also the means , not just the message that counted . creating awareness about racism " you might not have caught what the players said , but you knew that this was a stand against racism .
we can not change the hearts and minds of a few bigots , but we can create awareness and heighten sensitivity about race issues , " said piara powar , director of kick it out , the uk branch of the network fare , which stands for football against racism in europe . under an initiative by fare and world cup organizers fifa , the quarter-finals on june 30 and july 1 were long designated as " anti-discrimination " days . " as the world 's most popular sport , football has the power to fight racism " , said fifa president joseph blatter in an official statement . besides symbolic gestures that reach television audiences , fifa has also toughened sanctions for racial abuses by punishing clubs and national associations with match suspensions , point deductions and outright disqualification from competition . making the world cup a platform for a cause that fifa has taken such a strong position on a pressing social issue is a first in a major international tournament .
the move has been welcomed by various human rights groups and government figures . " it was courageous of fifa to take this step .
they did not need to dedicate this powerful platform to the fight against racism .
it is clear that this event will not solve the problem but it sends a clear message , " said south african human rights activist tokyo sexwale , who is a member of the 2010 world cup organizing committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye now combatting racism uwe-karsten heye , a close aide to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who recently created a storm of controversy over his widely publicized remarks about " no-go " areas for non-white visitors in eastern germany , praised the use of matches to send out anti-racist messages . use of celebrities to further a cause " these world class players - michael ballack , david beckham , zinedine zidane - are idolized by fans .
they have set a good precedent and bring sympathy to the cause , " said heye , who founded the advocacy group " gesicht zeigen ! " to combat racism . " but , the question is , what happens after the world cup ?
on the soccer field , as in daily life , there are always racist incidents simmering in the background , and one must not be blind to or walk away from them " stressed heye . even germany 's super-striker miroslav klose , who overcame prejudice as an immigrant from poland , has given his support to the anti-racist project " stand up .
speak up " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star striker miroslav klose lends his support for good causes striker miroslav klose 's campaign against landmines more visibly , klose has lent his image to another cause during the world cup - the campaign against the use of landmines .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic finland sets a real example for other european countries as one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in europe .
and they lead most significantly in providing an effective education system and care for their children .
finland has just taken over the eu presidency and they have a lot on their plate in this crisis-filled time .
but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 . the headlines calling for klinsmann 's head after a loss to italy in an exhibition match in march were clear . " inexperienced and overwhelmed " and " get rid of klinsi ! " were among the most unambiguous . now , after a trip to the semi-finals and another loss to italy , no one is willing to let go of the trainer who the nation 's parliament called in to explain his plan for germany 's soccer team , and the papers are glowing . " you 're still our heroes " and " soccer reformer klinsmann should stay " both make the popular case for klinsmann to remain with the german team . becke n bauer cha n ges his tu n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will klinsmann walk away from the german team after the semi-final loss ?
even one of his harshest critics , german soccer legend and world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer - who wanted the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to have a replacement for klinsmann on the " back burner " before germany lost tuesday night to italy - said it would be a shame for klinsmann to leave the german team after bringing in so many young players to create what klinsmann himself called the " new face of german soccer . " " i hope very much that he stays , " beckenbauer said .
" he has young players who trust him and who he trusts .
it would be a real shame if this team fell apart . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coach 's future is up in the air for the moment after pronouncing his pride in what the german team accomplished with its unexpected entry into the semi-finals , in an interview with germany 's sid sports news agency klinsmann said his future is still up in the air and called his contract situation " irrelevant . " " i 'm not wasting time on thinking about it at the moment , " klinsmann said .
" after a tournament like this you need to get yourself together and let everything sink in . " for two years i have put all my energy into and have thought about nothing other than reaching the final , " he added .
" i am going to take the next few days to talk with my wife and family and then come to some kind of decision . " rumors of us job co n ti n ue to swirl before the world cup klinsmann turned down an offer from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to extend his contract , maintaining that he would evaluate his options and make his decision based on the team 's performance in the tournament . one of those options is still rumored to be a spot at the top of the united states team .
last week klinsmann rejected the idea , saying he was putting all his energy into world cup preparations .
but tuesday 's london daily telegraph reported that a preliminary contact had been made for klinsmann to take over the us helm . decisio n n eeded by mid-august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger wants klinsmann in germany to give two more years worth of autographs klinsmann lives in california , his wife is american and he is viewed as the ideal man to replace bruce arena , whose future with the us team is uncertain .
the newspaper claimed that the americans will put a deal on the table that exceeds the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2.2 million euros , $ 2.8 million -rrb- a year klinsmann earns with germany . dfb president theo zwanziger , long a klinsmann supporter , said he would give the coach more than the few days he asked for to make up his mind . " the only deadline is our first national team match against sweden on aug.16 , " he said .
" he needs to have decided by then . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could klinsi put an end to the commute and stay in usa ?

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .
that could effectively mean the containment and restriction of gambling as a result of the june court decision . want to bet that the sports betting conflict will last a while longer ? marcel fürstenau -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sport betting stays in state hands in a decision that delighted local german sports officials and disappointed the private sector , germany 's highest court ruled against breaking up the state monopoly on sports gambling .

zinedine zidane 's penalty was enough to put france in sunday 's final against italy . zinedine zidane fired france into their second world cup final appearance in eight years in munich on wednesday , scoring the only goal in a 1-0 semi-final victory over portugal . the french captain shattered portugal 's dreams of a first ever appearance in the final after coolly converting a hotly disputed penalty midway through the first half at the 62,000-seat allianz arena . zidane 's goal was a repeat of his spot-kick winner against the portuguese in the semi-finals of euro 2000 and sent france into a final on sunday against italy - just as it had done six years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricardo picked the right side but could n't stop zizou scoring but the decider was shrouded in controversy , with portugal protesting uruguayan referee jorge larrionda 's decision to point to the spot after chelsea defender ricardo carvalho brought down thierry henry just inside the area . a clever touch by henry wrong-footed carvalho who fell but stuck his leg out , and although the arsenal star reacted theatrically to clear contact , larrionda had no hesitation in pointing to the spot . portuguese goalkeeper ricardo had saved three penalties in his side 's shoot-out victory over england in the quarter-finals on saturday but though he dived the right way zidane 's 33rd-minute spot kick gave him no chance , buried majestically into the corner . france , the 1998 champions , spent much of the remainder of the game on the back foot as portugal searched desperately for an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's former galactico figo was shut out but despite dominating territory and possession much of the second half , portugal were unable to find a way through a french defense superbly marshaled by lilian thuram and william gallas . luis figo missed a glorious chance to equalize when he headed over on 78 minutes after a cristiano ronaldo free-kick that french keeper fabien barthez spilled comically . a furious late rally saw portugal camped in french territory but les bleus held firm to keep their dream of a second title alive . the match had threatened to boil over towards the end of the first half when portugal had a penalty appeal of their own waved away . ronaldo - booed whenever he touched the ball in the first half - leapt for a cross and fell over french defender willy sagnol . portugal coach luiz felipe scolari and the entire portugal bench were out of the dug-out in protest but referee larrionda was having none of it , and replays showed there was no contact whatsoever . an entertaining opening 45 minutes saw both sides go close early on ; dispelling fears the match would be a tense affair with five players from each team starting on a yellow card . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were few clear chances in the tight game portugal , who had welcomed the return from suspension of midfield enforcer costinha and barcelona playmaker deco , were quickly into their stride with ronaldo looking menacing down the left . both deco and figo forced barthez into scrambled saves in the opening 15 minutes , while midfielder maniche saw a shot fly millimeters over the bar . yet though portugal had the clearer chances , france did not appear to be unduly troubled , their back four restricting their opponents to long-range efforts only . ronaldo , who has been demonized in england this week for his part in the dismissal of wayne rooney last weekend , was singled out as the pantomime villain by french and neutral fans immediately . boos and whistles greeted the manchester united winger 's every touch and he enraged france coach raymond domenech on the half-hour , the french coach accusing him of attempting to con the referee with a dive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de zinedine zidane : the making of a soccer legend it started in a marseille ghetto before weaving its way through europe , gathering riches on the way .

the use of star striker miroslav klose also brings attention to the campaign against landmines . the huge banner before millions of television viewers tuned in to the quarter-final matches , was clear : " say no to racism . " between the national anthem and the kick-off , the captains of eight teams , - germany , argentina , italy , ukraine , england , portugal , brazil , and france - read statements from a clipboard condemning racism , using the world cup as a platform to send a message around the globe .

they have set a good precedent and bring sympathy to the cause , " said heye , who founded the advocacy group " gesicht zeigen ! " to combat racism . " but , the question is , what happens after the world cup ?
on the soccer field , as in daily life , there are always racist incidents simmering in the background , and one must not be blind to or walk away from them " stressed heye . even germany 's super-striker miroslav klose , who overcame prejudice as an immigrant from poland , has given his support to the anti-racist project " stand up .

he even approved the publicity photo .
that klose is also immensely popular and credible , is very much a boost for us " , said thomas küchenmeister , head of the anti-landmine lobby " aktionbündnis landmine .

" between the national anthem and the kick-off , the captains of eight teams , - germany , argentina , italy , ukraine , england , portugal , brazil , and france - read statements from a clipboard condemning racism , using the world cup as a platform to send a message around the globe .

we can not change the hearts and minds of a few bigots , but we can create awareness and heighten sensitivity about race issues , " said piara powar , director of kick it out , the uk branch of the network fare , which stands for football against racism in europe . under an initiative by fare and world cup organizers fifa , the quarter-finals on june 30 and july 1 were long designated as " anti-discrimination " days .

they have set a good precedent and bring sympathy to the cause , " said heye , who founded the advocacy group " gesicht zeigen ! " to combat racism . " but , the question is , what happens after the world cup ?
on the soccer field , as in daily life , there are always racist incidents simmering in the background , and one must not be blind to or walk away from them " stressed heye . even germany 's super-striker miroslav klose , who overcame prejudice as an immigrant from poland , has given his support to the anti-racist project " stand up .

" the close defeat does n't hurt , " the paper said , " because the german team achieved so much . "
" these players did n't just come out ahead of strong nations such as brazil , argentina , and the netherlands - their appearances were also really enjoyable .
they also changed the people in this country , at least for three and a half weeks , leaving them happier , more relaxed and more confident . " " we 're crying with you , " read the headline in the popular tabloid bild zeitu n g , " but you 're still heroes ! "
the paper was full of encouragement after the bitter defeat , and full of confidence that germany " will take third place on saturday , and not complain ... to klinsi and all the boys , we say , thank you for this wonderful world cup .
what has grown in the last couple of weeks will remain .
the germans have re-discovered a love for their country and their team , " bild wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach jürgen klinsmann : what does his future hold ?
the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .
" thanks to klinsmann , german soccer gained an unexpected easiness and a new perspective .
not to use this , to let the flame die , would be a much greater loss than the defeat in the semi-final match - with or without klinsmann . " outside germany , britain 's daily mirror commented on the italian team , saying that tuesday 's victory would go a long way in redeeming italy in the wake of the soccer corruption scandal that " infected the soul of the nation ... they came as the pariahs of the world , the men who represented everything that football wants to forget about the dark side of the beautiful game , " the paper wrote .

" the close defeat does n't hurt , " the paper said , " because the german team achieved so much . "
" these players did n't just come out ahead of strong nations such as brazil , argentina , and the netherlands - their appearances were also really enjoyable .
they also changed the people in this country , at least for three and a half weeks , leaving them happier , more relaxed and more confident . " " we 're crying with you , " read the headline in the popular tabloid bild zeitu n g , " but you 're still heroes ! "
the paper was full of encouragement after the bitter defeat , and full of confidence that germany " will take third place on saturday , and not complain ... to klinsi and all the boys , we say , thank you for this wonderful world cup .
what has grown in the last couple of weeks will remain .
the germans have re-discovered a love for their country and their team , " bild wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach jürgen klinsmann : what does his future hold ?
the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .
" thanks to klinsmann , german soccer gained an unexpected easiness and a new perspective .
not to use this , to let the flame die , would be a much greater loss than the defeat in the semi-final match - with or without klinsmann . " outside germany , britain 's daily mirror commented on the italian team , saying that tuesday 's victory would go a long way in redeeming italy in the wake of the soccer corruption scandal that " infected the soul of the nation ... they came as the pariahs of the world , the men who represented everything that football wants to forget about the dark side of the beautiful game , " the paper wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2006 betting to win billions in the grey zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the legality of the current sports betting monopoly is being questioned germany and the world are still caught up in soccer fever .
but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .
that could effectively mean the containment and restriction of gambling as a result of the june court decision . want to bet that the sports betting conflict will last a while longer ? marcel fürstenau -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sport betting stays in state hands in a decision that delighted local german sports officials and disappointed the private sector , germany 's highest court ruled against breaking up the state monopoly on sports gambling .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns .

now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 . the headlines calling for klinsmann 's head after a loss to italy in an exhibition match in march were clear . " inexperienced and overwhelmed " and " get rid of klinsi ! " were among the most unambiguous . now , after a trip to the semi-finals and another loss to italy , no one is willing to let go of the trainer who the nation 's parliament called in to explain his plan for germany 's soccer team , and the papers are glowing . " you 're still our heroes " and " soccer reformer klinsmann should stay " both make the popular case for klinsmann to remain with the german team . becke n bauer cha n ges his tu n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will klinsmann walk away from the german team after the semi-final loss ?
even one of his harshest critics , german soccer legend and world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer - who wanted the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to have a replacement for klinsmann on the " back burner " before germany lost tuesday night to italy - said it would be a shame for klinsmann to leave the german team after bringing in so many young players to create what klinsmann himself called the " new face of german soccer . " " i hope very much that he stays , " beckenbauer said .
" he has young players who trust him and who he trusts .
it would be a real shame if this team fell apart . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coach 's future is up in the air for the moment after pronouncing his pride in what the german team accomplished with its unexpected entry into the semi-finals , in an interview with germany 's sid sports news agency klinsmann said his future is still up in the air and called his contract situation " irrelevant . " " i 'm not wasting time on thinking about it at the moment , " klinsmann said .
" after a tournament like this you need to get yourself together and let everything sink in . " for two years i have put all my energy into and have thought about nothing other than reaching the final , " he added .
" i am going to take the next few days to talk with my wife and family and then come to some kind of decision . " rumors of us job co n ti n ue to swirl before the world cup klinsmann turned down an offer from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to extend his contract , maintaining that he would evaluate his options and make his decision based on the team 's performance in the tournament . one of those options is still rumored to be a spot at the top of the united states team .
last week klinsmann rejected the idea , saying he was putting all his energy into world cup preparations .

the newspaper claimed that the americans will put a deal on the table that exceeds the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2.2 million euros , $ 2.8 million -rrb- a year klinsmann earns with germany . dfb president theo zwanziger , long a klinsmann supporter , said he would give the coach more than the few days he asked for to make up his mind .

but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .
i watched a young woman stroke a neatly folded german flag in her lap as she glanced at her downbeat boyfriend with worried eyes .
i watched a grumpy teenager in his original german team soccer jersey , who looked like he was ready to punch someone until his father told him to look at an advertisement on the window behind him . " jesus rettet , " it read .
jesus saves . germa n y 's lesso n the teen chuckled and suddenly it dawned on me .
while germany 's fourth of july might have been incredibly painful , it could teach the country a lesson that 's much more important than winning the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even michael ballack could n't help but cry which lesson ?
that it 's okay to lose , especially after giving it your best - both on the pitch and on the streets .
that germans seem to have won something that 's much more important than the short-lived joy of a weltmeister title : the ability to celebrate their team and their country without making others feel threatened by a new-found , friendly patriotism . last night , the streets fell silent .
they lacked the honking concerts that followed the recent victories of germany 's soccer team .
but this morning , the black , red and yellow flags were still flying atop cars and germans were looking forward to cheering for their guys in their final world cup game for third place on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to disappear from germany 's streets any time soon " now more than ever , " read the shirt that one tv commentator put on after tuesday 's match .
he praised " our " performance and said that germany 's young team has a bright future ahead . as far as i know , the european championships are coming up in 2008 .
let 's try that for starters .
i 'll be watching .
and i 'll keep my fingers crossed . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : chin up , germany european editorials on wednesday commented on germany 's dramatic loss to italy in tuesday 's world cup semi-final match , with most papers giving germany a sympathetic pat on the back for a job well done .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2006 betting to win billions in the grey zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the legality of the current sports betting monopoly is being questioned germany and the world are still caught up in soccer fever .
but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .
that could effectively mean the containment and restriction of gambling as a result of the june court decision . want to bet that the sports betting conflict will last a while longer ? marcel fürstenau -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sport betting stays in state hands in a decision that delighted local german sports officials and disappointed the private sector , germany 's highest court ruled against breaking up the state monopoly on sports gambling .

" the close defeat does n't hurt , " the paper said , " because the german team achieved so much . "
" these players did n't just come out ahead of strong nations such as brazil , argentina , and the netherlands - their appearances were also really enjoyable .
they also changed the people in this country , at least for three and a half weeks , leaving them happier , more relaxed and more confident . " " we 're crying with you , " read the headline in the popular tabloid bild zeitu n g , " but you 're still heroes ! "
the paper was full of encouragement after the bitter defeat , and full of confidence that germany " will take third place on saturday , and not complain ... to klinsi and all the boys , we say , thank you for this wonderful world cup .
what has grown in the last couple of weeks will remain .
the germans have re-discovered a love for their country and their team , " bild wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach jürgen klinsmann : what does his future hold ?
the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .
" thanks to klinsmann , german soccer gained an unexpected easiness and a new perspective .
not to use this , to let the flame die , would be a much greater loss than the defeat in the semi-final match - with or without klinsmann . " outside germany , britain 's daily mirror commented on the italian team , saying that tuesday 's victory would go a long way in redeeming italy in the wake of the soccer corruption scandal that " infected the soul of the nation ... they came as the pariahs of the world , the men who represented everything that football wants to forget about the dark side of the beautiful game , " the paper wrote .
" but on sunday , it is italy who will march into berlin 's olympic stadium , their chests puffed out with pride , their honor restored , their courage rewarded . " the guardia n of london commented that germany has been " brusquely shaken awake from its world cup dream , " but said that the team can hold their heads high .
" throughout the world cup they played intelligent , aggressive football , " the paper said , adding that tuesday 's game could have gone either way .
" afterwards there were tears in the westfalenstadion and across the country , but better this death than meek surrender . " sweden 's afto n bladet was pleased with the match , praising both sides .
" italy came to the world cup as the object of hatred and has now achieved more than anyone could have dreamed , " the paper wrote .
" the italians played for their honor , the germans for a nation in ecstasy .
finally , a world cup match that met the greatest of expectations . " and as to be expected , italy 's press was full of praise for the men in blue .
" wonderful italy , " wrote rome 's la stampa .
" grosso and del piero have given us the finals , we 're going to berlin .

but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .
i watched a young woman stroke a neatly folded german flag in her lap as she glanced at her downbeat boyfriend with worried eyes .
i watched a grumpy teenager in his original german team soccer jersey , who looked like he was ready to punch someone until his father told him to look at an advertisement on the window behind him . " jesus rettet , " it read .
jesus saves . germa n y 's lesso n the teen chuckled and suddenly it dawned on me .
while germany 's fourth of july might have been incredibly painful , it could teach the country a lesson that 's much more important than winning the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even michael ballack could n't help but cry which lesson ?
that it 's okay to lose , especially after giving it your best - both on the pitch and on the streets .
that germans seem to have won something that 's much more important than the short-lived joy of a weltmeister title : the ability to celebrate their team and their country without making others feel threatened by a new-found , friendly patriotism . last night , the streets fell silent .
they lacked the honking concerts that followed the recent victories of germany 's soccer team .
but this morning , the black , red and yellow flags were still flying atop cars and germans were looking forward to cheering for their guys in their final world cup game for third place on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to disappear from germany 's streets any time soon " now more than ever , " read the shirt that one tv commentator put on after tuesday 's match .
he praised " our " performance and said that germany 's young team has a bright future ahead . as far as i know , the european championships are coming up in 2008 .
let 's try that for starters .
i 'll be watching .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic finland sets a real example for other european countries as one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in europe .
and they lead most significantly in providing an effective education system and care for their children .
finland has just taken over the eu presidency and they have a lot on their plate in this crisis-filled time .
but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .
i watched a young woman stroke a neatly folded german flag in her lap as she glanced at her downbeat boyfriend with worried eyes .
i watched a grumpy teenager in his original german team soccer jersey , who looked like he was ready to punch someone until his father told him to look at an advertisement on the window behind him . " jesus rettet , " it read .
jesus saves . germa n y 's lesso n the teen chuckled and suddenly it dawned on me .
while germany 's fourth of july might have been incredibly painful , it could teach the country a lesson that 's much more important than winning the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even michael ballack could n't help but cry which lesson ?
that it 's okay to lose , especially after giving it your best - both on the pitch and on the streets .
that germans seem to have won something that 's much more important than the short-lived joy of a weltmeister title : the ability to celebrate their team and their country without making others feel threatened by a new-found , friendly patriotism . last night , the streets fell silent .
they lacked the honking concerts that followed the recent victories of germany 's soccer team .
but this morning , the black , red and yellow flags were still flying atop cars and germans were looking forward to cheering for their guys in their final world cup game for third place on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to disappear from germany 's streets any time soon " now more than ever , " read the shirt that one tv commentator put on after tuesday 's match .
he praised " our " performance and said that germany 's young team has a bright future ahead . as far as i know , the european championships are coming up in 2008 .
let 's try that for starters .
i 'll be watching .
and i 'll keep my fingers crossed . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : chin up , germany european editorials on wednesday commented on germany 's dramatic loss to italy in tuesday 's world cup semi-final match , with most papers giving germany a sympathetic pat on the back for a job well done .
-lrb- june 5 , 2006 -rrb- german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic finland sets a real example for other european countries as one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in europe .
and they lead most significantly in providing an effective education system and care for their children .
finland has just taken over the eu presidency and they have a lot on their plate in this crisis-filled time .
but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic finland sets a real example for other european countries as one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in europe .
and they lead most significantly in providing an effective education system and care for their children .

but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic finland sets a real example for other european countries as one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in europe .
and they lead most significantly in providing an effective education system and care for their children .

but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

" the close defeat does n't hurt , " the paper said , " because the german team achieved so much . "
" these players did n't just come out ahead of strong nations such as brazil , argentina , and the netherlands - their appearances were also really enjoyable .
they also changed the people in this country , at least for three and a half weeks , leaving them happier , more relaxed and more confident . " " we 're crying with you , " read the headline in the popular tabloid bild zeitu n g , " but you 're still heroes ! "
the paper was full of encouragement after the bitter defeat , and full of confidence that germany " will take third place on saturday , and not complain ... to klinsi and all the boys , we say , thank you for this wonderful world cup .
what has grown in the last couple of weeks will remain .
the germans have re-discovered a love for their country and their team , " bild wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach jürgen klinsmann : what does his future hold ?
the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .
" thanks to klinsmann , german soccer gained an unexpected easiness and a new perspective .
not to use this , to let the flame die , would be a much greater loss than the defeat in the semi-final match - with or without klinsmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2006 betting to win billions in the grey zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the legality of the current sports betting monopoly is being questioned germany and the world are still caught up in soccer fever .
but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2006 betting to win billions in the grey zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the legality of the current sports betting monopoly is being questioned germany and the world are still caught up in soccer fever .
but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization . " an effective decision would be a way to get a grip on issues like addiction and sponsorship , said huether .
" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .

there was even a prescient moment when david beckham 's microphone fizzed out along with england 's hopes , and portugal captain luis figo graciously proffered his own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david beckham 's microphone went out along with england 's hopes never mind that the statements were in part inaudible or issued in a language that most viewers could not understand .
it was also the means , not just the message that counted . creating awareness about racism " you might not have caught what the players said , but you knew that this was a stand against racism .
we can not change the hearts and minds of a few bigots , but we can create awareness and heighten sensitivity about race issues , " said piara powar , director of kick it out , the uk branch of the network fare , which stands for football against racism in europe . under an initiative by fare and world cup organizers fifa , the quarter-finals on june 30 and july 1 were long designated as " anti-discrimination " days .

the move has been welcomed by various human rights groups and government figures . " it was courageous of fifa to take this step .
they did not need to dedicate this powerful platform to the fight against racism .
it is clear that this event will not solve the problem but it sends a clear message , " said south african human rights activist tokyo sexwale , who is a member of the 2010 world cup organizing committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye now combatting racism uwe-karsten heye , a close aide to former chancellor gerhard schröder , who recently created a storm of controversy over his widely publicized remarks about " no-go " areas for non-white visitors in eastern germany , praised the use of matches to send out anti-racist messages . use of celebrities to further a cause " these world class players - michael ballack , david beckham , zinedine zidane - are idolized by fans .
they have set a good precedent and bring sympathy to the cause , " said heye , who founded the advocacy group " gesicht zeigen ! " to combat racism . " but , the question is , what happens after the world cup ?
on the soccer field , as in daily life , there are always racist incidents simmering in the background , and one must not be blind to or walk away from them " stressed heye . even germany 's super-striker miroslav klose , who overcame prejudice as an immigrant from poland , has given his support to the anti-racist project " stand up .

" we 've already beaten portugal but i 'm not into statistics , that 's history , this is 2006 , the reality is on wednesday night , " domenech said . france 's magical quarter-final win over brazil has sent belief that a second world cup crown in eight years is suddenly within touching distance after looking a distant dream during a shaky first round . domenech 's priority before wednesday is to get his side off of cloud nine and focused on the job of beating portugal .
" the danger for us now is to think we 've done it by beating brazil , we 've got to get the players back to where they were before that win , " domenech said . " we 've achieved something super ... but our work is not finished , we ca n't let up .
for me success at this world cup only comes if we win .

" i think it 's precisely because he is retiring , because he is ending his career , that he 's fully focused on the game , " domenech said . " now he does n't have to calculate anything .
he can play with freedom and expression , because he knows every game could be his last .
that is the reason why he 's able to play so well . " physical portugal a risk for carded fre n ch domenech 's biggest worry is the fact that no fewer than six of his expected starting line-up - zidane , willy sagnol , louis saha , lilian thuram , patrick vieira and franck ribery - go into the match on a yellow card . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's players have given no quarter with portugal having shown themselves to be adept at bringing the worst out of their opponents over the last two rounds , where both england and holland had players sent off against them , that will be a concern for domenech . " they are a quality side who have proved capable of imposing their style of play on their rivals , " said domenech .
" i do n't know scolari but i think he 's world champion is n't he ? " scolari , who coached brazil to the 2002 world cup , will be buoyed by the return from suspension of midfield playmaker deco and his minder costinha . the master motivator , scolari has urged his team to create history by becoming the first portuguese side to reach the world cup final in only their fourth tournament . history becko n s for scolari 's " warrior " team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal coach scolari has instilled a warrior spirit " we had the chance to create a piece of history at the 2004 european championship and we did n't take it , " said scolari , referring to portugal 's failure to win their first major tournament on home soil two years ago .
" now we have got another chance to make history at the world cup . " scolari has put his team 's progression through the tournament down to a new-found ' warrior spirit ' that has been grafted on to portugal 's long tradition of technical excellence . " the spirit of this team is remarkable , " scolari said .

the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .
" thanks to klinsmann , german soccer gained an unexpected easiness and a new perspective .
not to use this , to let the flame die , would be a much greater loss than the defeat in the semi-final match - with or without klinsmann . " outside germany , britain 's daily mirror commented on the italian team , saying that tuesday 's victory would go a long way in redeeming italy in the wake of the soccer corruption scandal that " infected the soul of the nation ... they came as the pariahs of the world , the men who represented everything that football wants to forget about the dark side of the beautiful game , " the paper wrote .
" but on sunday , it is italy who will march into berlin 's olympic stadium , their chests puffed out with pride , their honor restored , their courage rewarded . " the guardia n of london commented that germany has been " brusquely shaken awake from its world cup dream , " but said that the team can hold their heads high .
" throughout the world cup they played intelligent , aggressive football , " the paper said , adding that tuesday 's game could have gone either way .
" afterwards there were tears in the westfalenstadion and across the country , but better this death than meek surrender . " sweden 's afto n bladet was pleased with the match , praising both sides .
" italy came to the world cup as the object of hatred and has now achieved more than anyone could have dreamed , " the paper wrote .
" the italians played for their honor , the germans for a nation in ecstasy .
finally , a world cup match that met the greatest of expectations . " and as to be expected , italy 's press was full of praise for the men in blue .
" wonderful italy , " wrote rome 's la stampa .

media commentators criticized coach jurgen klinsmann as the team suffered a series of pre-match defeats . but that was before a string of wins in the world cup matches threw the normally cautious and skeptical german nature out the door . so it was that much more bitter when on tuesday , italy beat germany 2-0 in last minute goals . " it is very sad to end like this , because we really thought germany could do it now , " matthias brucker , standing in dortmund 's friedenplatz , told the bbc . others hailed the team 's surprisingly long run . " it 's a pity - it was a great game , " said chancellor angela merkel , who sat next to italian prime minister romano prodi during the game .
" unfortunately it was n't quite enough .
but this team can still accomplish a lot . " the top-selling bild newspaper also tried for a glass-half-full view with the banner headline , " we are crying with you !
you are still heroes " around a giant photo of klinsmann , head in hands . shock , surprise millions of fans around germany watched the match with baited breath .
in dortmund , 200,000 fans cheered and groaned during the game at the stadium ; outside , around the country , fans crowded around big screens to follow the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they expected their team to do better in berlin , almost a million people trudged away from the fan mile behind the capital 's best-known monument , the brandenburg gate , after following the action on big screens .
the fan mile has been one of the abiding successes of this world cup , and had to be extended ahead of the match . during the final minutes of the game , the area was eerily quiet .
after the winning goals , some cried , others applauded , most waved flags . " we are still proud of them , " lukas schmidt , 18 , told dpa .
" at the start no-one said they had a chance .
but they went all the way to the last minute of the semi-finals .
you ca n't ask for more . " klinsmann echoed the sentiment . " we are hugely disappointed , " he told dpa .
" it 's amazing the spirit -lrb- the team -rrb- showed , the character .
they made a whole country really proud . " a celebratio n it was a different mood among italians - pure elation .

" not only is enlargement a key tool for strengthening stability and democracy but it is also one of the strategic responses to the challenges of globalization , " vanhanen told the european parliament .
" the eu must continue to be an open union .
european countries that fulfill the membership criteria must have the possibility to join . " in outlining the priorities , vanhanen departed from finland 's predecessor , austria , who was less than enthusiastic over turkey 's bid for membership .
austria wanted to limit the size of the eu and wanted its ability to absorb new members to become a decisive issue for future candidates . opposition to enlargement is seen as a key factor in the unsuccessful referendums over the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year . pushi n g o n with the co n stitutio n in addition to consulting with other eu members on the constitution and pushing for its ratification in finland this year , the finnish leader said that it is necessary to move forward with other internal initiatives to reform the eu 's decision-making processes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's prime minister , matti vanhanen says that he wants to bring back latin " during our presidency , we will try to look outwards and inwards , " he said .
" i do n't agree with pessimistic speeches about the crisis in the eu .
i believe the current problems can be overcome . "
for example , vanhanen wants more integration in policing and in the judiciary by using a special legal procedure to shift these policies to another level of decision-making , with more powers for the european commission and parliament and less unanimous voting among member states .
" there may be something of a wait-and-see mood in the union , but the world around us is not going to stop and wait , " he said .
" we would be doing future generations of europeans a great disservice if we were simply to shut our eyes to the historic challenges that we face and wait for better times to come . " closer ties with russia other priorities that vanhanen outlined were closer cooperation with russia , pushing through legislative packages such as the chemical law reach and the services directive .
he also pledged more openness in the ministerial meetings as agreed to at the eu summit last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closer ties with the kremlin are a priority one concrete proposal that finland is already pushing is a tax increase on alcohol across the eu .
the topic is already on the agenda for meetings next week . " it is necessary to harmonize the tax rates to even out the price levels of alcohol , " finland said in a press release .
another initiative , considered a bit far out by some , is to publish weekly eu news bulletins in latin on its website every wednesday . the new eu president will also have its hands full with a few tricky issues .
one is a growing dispute between eu member cyprus and candidate turkey .
cyprus wants turkey to open its ports and airspace to their ships and planes . vanhanen said that turkey will be dealt with " openly and honestly " but that is has a " long and bumpy " road ahead in fulfilling membership criteria . no more backslappi n g some eu parliamentarians welcomed the initiatives as a good sign of things to come . " we need the constitution , " martin schulz , a german social democrat , told dpa news service of the push to revive the instrument . on russia , there was more dissent . " we need a stabile partnership with russia , but let 's finish now with the backslapping , " hans-gert pöttering , a german christian democratic eu parliamentarian told dpa , referring to human rights concerns over russia . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria hands eu baton to finland on saturday , austria hands over the presidency of the european union to finland .
the alpine republic declared some lofty goals during its time at the top , but to what extent did it deliver ?
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .
-lrb- june 16 , 2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic finland sets a real example for other european countries as one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in europe .

but they believe they can successfully tackle issues and move the eu forward .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .
markus meyer , director of the betting service " betandwin " is confident that the liberalization of the industry is only a matter of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting is particularly popular during the world cup strict requirements whether the state betting monopoly collapses or holds its ground has to be decided by the end of 2007 at the latest , a deadline the national administrative court set for the lawmakers in march .
either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization .

" we would be very interested in that ourselves .
but we desperately need unambiguous regulation . " support for amateur athletes andreas eichler , general secretary of the german olympic sports association , also hopes for an explicit framework for the betting industry .
he referenced financial support for amateur sports from state lottery funds , a portion of which comes from the money bet on sporting events . the german olympic sports association takes in at least 500 million euros -lrb- 640 million dollars -rrb- annually from gambling .
these funds are passed on to amateur and charitable sports organizations , not professional athletes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amateur sports clubs see only a small portion of money from sports betting " without this support , the very subsistence of sports would be endangered .
for this reason , every reform is coupled with our demand to ensure that sports sponsorship is maintained without this framework , " said eichler . state monopoly still in place following the latest meeting of minister presidents , it appears that the state-monopoly will remain politically intact .
law enforcement funds are to be implemented in the fight against illegal sports betting , which is already being done to some extent . recently , private betting services have been shut down again and again .
only three federal states - baden-württemberg , rhineland-pfalz and schleswig-holstein - have advocated limiting licenses for private providers . fdp spokesman for sports politics detlef parr also believes authorization for private betting services should be restricted .
parr is the former director of a düsseldorf high school and also a license for coaching soccer .
he said a liberalization of the betting market would lead to higher revenues for sports . considering the european dimension as far as sports betting is concerned , sports in germany gain relatively little : around 17 million euros -lrb- 21.7 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship currently come from betting , but that is from a total volume of more than half a billion euros . regardless of how sports betting in germany is legally regulated in the future , the european dimension must be taken into account .
and that leads down a path of greater liberalization , since freedom for subsidiaries and providers is an eu principle . in 2003 the european court of justice set down guidelines , according to which a state betting monopoly can only be justified if there is a compelling , objective reason for it .

but there 's another , not exactly legal sport that 's currently stirring up passion among more and more fans in germany : sports betting . billions of euros are won and lost on the field of sports betting - a field that is theoretically controlled by the state in germany .
but the practical reality looks a bit different .
it 's where many private providers score big , but legally speaking , it 's a grey zone . convoluted legal situation june 22 , 2006 was a dark day for private betting services in germany .
the national administrative court in leipzig publicly announced that those who had received permission from the state during german reunification to organize private betting were not allowed to open shop in the rest of the country . on the one hand , the betting monopoly lies in hands of the state , but on the other hand , the federal states can allocate betting licenses to private providers .
the legal situation is even more unclear for betting services located outside the country that operate via the internet . in other words : the state-run betting monopoly no longer exists . relatively few state providers in 2005 , some 3.6 billion euros -lrb- 4.6 billion dollars -rrb- were turned over in sports betting in germany .
only a ninth of the total volume -lrb- 400 million euros , 512 million dollars -rrb- came from state-run betting service " oddset " . the private betting services , however , are n't worrying too much about the latest statement from the national administrative court .

either a legally overseen authorization for private betting companies will be put in place or the state monopoly will maintain its mandate to fight gambling addiction and curb betting enthusiasm , according to the court 's statement . the situation is tricky - and not only because it 's not clear at first glance why private betting services are supposed to be more dangerous than state-run organizations . hope for transparency companies that earn money from sports betting advertising have a foremost obligation to legal clarity .
rainer huether , director of deutsches sport fernsehen -lrb- german sports television -rrb- , for example , revealed that sports betting ads make up 25 percent of the broadcaster 's total commercial spots . huether is hopeful for a clear decision : " it does n't matter to me which direction it goes , although we would naturally prefer a decision favorable to liberalization .

zinedine zidane 's penalty was enough to put france in sunday 's final against italy . zinedine zidane fired france into their second world cup final appearance in eight years in munich on wednesday , scoring the only goal in a 1-0 semi-final victory over portugal . the french captain shattered portugal 's dreams of a first ever appearance in the final after coolly converting a hotly disputed penalty midway through the first half at the 62,000-seat allianz arena . zidane 's goal was a repeat of his spot-kick winner against the portuguese in the semi-finals of euro 2000 and sent france into a final on sunday against italy - just as it had done six years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricardo picked the right side but could n't stop zizou scoring but the decider was shrouded in controversy , with portugal protesting uruguayan referee jorge larrionda 's decision to point to the spot after chelsea defender ricardo carvalho brought down thierry henry just inside the area . a clever touch by henry wrong-footed carvalho who fell but stuck his leg out , and although the arsenal star reacted theatrically to clear contact , larrionda had no hesitation in pointing to the spot . portuguese goalkeeper ricardo had saved three penalties in his side 's shoot-out victory over england in the quarter-finals on saturday but though he dived the right way zidane 's 33rd-minute spot kick gave him no chance , buried majestically into the corner . france , the 1998 champions , spent much of the remainder of the game on the back foot as portugal searched desperately for an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's former galactico figo was shut out but despite dominating territory and possession much of the second half , portugal were unable to find a way through a french defense superbly marshaled by lilian thuram and william gallas . luis figo missed a glorious chance to equalize when he headed over on 78 minutes after a cristiano ronaldo free-kick that french keeper fabien barthez spilled comically . a furious late rally saw portugal camped in french territory but les bleus held firm to keep their dream of a second title alive . the match had threatened to boil over towards the end of the first half when portugal had a penalty appeal of their own waved away . ronaldo - booed whenever he touched the ball in the first half - leapt for a cross and fell over french defender willy sagnol . portugal coach luiz felipe scolari and the entire portugal bench were out of the dug-out in protest but referee larrionda was having none of it , and replays showed there was no contact whatsoever . an entertaining opening 45 minutes saw both sides go close early on ; dispelling fears the match would be a tense affair with five players from each team starting on a yellow card . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were few clear chances in the tight game portugal , who had welcomed the return from suspension of midfield enforcer costinha and barcelona playmaker deco , were quickly into their stride with ronaldo looking menacing down the left . both deco and figo forced barthez into scrambled saves in the opening 15 minutes , while midfielder maniche saw a shot fly millimeters over the bar . yet though portugal had the clearer chances , france did not appear to be unduly troubled , their back four restricting their opponents to long-range efforts only . ronaldo , who has been demonized in england this week for his part in the dismissal of wayne rooney last weekend , was singled out as the pantomime villain by french and neutral fans immediately . boos and whistles greeted the manchester united winger 's every touch and he enraged france coach raymond domenech on the half-hour , the french coach accusing him of attempting to con the referee with a dive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de zinedine zidane : the making of a soccer legend it started in a marseille ghetto before weaving its way through europe , gathering riches on the way .

" the close defeat does n't hurt , " the paper said , " because the german team achieved so much . "
" these players did n't just come out ahead of strong nations such as brazil , argentina , and the netherlands - their appearances were also really enjoyable .
they also changed the people in this country , at least for three and a half weeks , leaving them happier , more relaxed and more confident . " " we 're crying with you , " read the headline in the popular tabloid bild zeitu n g , " but you 're still heroes ! "
the paper was full of encouragement after the bitter defeat , and full of confidence that germany " will take third place on saturday , and not complain ... to klinsi and all the boys , we say , thank you for this wonderful world cup .
what has grown in the last couple of weeks will remain .
the germans have re-discovered a love for their country and their team , " bild wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach jürgen klinsmann : what does his future hold ?
the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g commented on the achievements of german coach jürgen klinsmann , writing that the passionate soccer that brought germany so much joy is a victory that no one can take away .
the california-based national trainer must now decide whether he will continue in his role , the paper said .
" thanks to klinsmann , german soccer gained an unexpected easiness and a new perspective .
not to use this , to let the flame die , would be a much greater loss than the defeat in the semi-final match - with or without klinsmann . " outside germany , britain 's daily mirror commented on the italian team , saying that tuesday 's victory would go a long way in redeeming italy in the wake of the soccer corruption scandal that " infected the soul of the nation ... they came as the pariahs of the world , the men who represented everything that football wants to forget about the dark side of the beautiful game , " the paper wrote .
" but on sunday , it is italy who will march into berlin 's olympic stadium , their chests puffed out with pride , their honor restored , their courage rewarded . " the guardia n of london commented that germany has been " brusquely shaken awake from its world cup dream , " but said that the team can hold their heads high .
" throughout the world cup they played intelligent , aggressive football , " the paper said , adding that tuesday 's game could have gone either way .
" afterwards there were tears in the westfalenstadion and across the country , but better this death than meek surrender . " sweden 's afto n bladet was pleased with the match , praising both sides .
" italy came to the world cup as the object of hatred and has now achieved more than anyone could have dreamed , " the paper wrote .
" the italians played for their honor , the germans for a nation in ecstasy .
finally , a world cup match that met the greatest of expectations . " and as to be expected , italy 's press was full of praise for the men in blue .
" wonderful italy , " wrote rome 's la stampa .
" grosso and del piero have given us the finals , we 're going to berlin .

now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 . the headlines calling for klinsmann 's head after a loss to italy in an exhibition match in march were clear . " inexperienced and overwhelmed " and " get rid of klinsi ! " were among the most unambiguous . now , after a trip to the semi-finals and another loss to italy , no one is willing to let go of the trainer who the nation 's parliament called in to explain his plan for germany 's soccer team , and the papers are glowing .

even one of his harshest critics , german soccer legend and world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer - who wanted the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to have a replacement for klinsmann on the " back burner " before germany lost tuesday night to italy - said it would be a shame for klinsmann to leave the german team after bringing in so many young players to create what klinsmann himself called the " new face of german soccer . " " i hope very much that he stays , " beckenbauer said .
" he has young players who trust him and who he trusts .

" after a tournament like this you need to get yourself together and let everything sink in . " for two years i have put all my energy into and have thought about nothing other than reaching the final , " he added .
" i am going to take the next few days to talk with my wife and family and then come to some kind of decision . " rumors of us job co n ti n ue to swirl before the world cup klinsmann turned down an offer from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to extend his contract , maintaining that he would evaluate his options and make his decision based on the team 's performance in the tournament . one of those options is still rumored to be a spot at the top of the united states team .
last week klinsmann rejected the idea , saying he was putting all his energy into world cup preparations .

the newspaper claimed that the americans will put a deal on the table that exceeds the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- 2.2 million euros , $ 2.8 million -rrb- a year klinsmann earns with germany . dfb president theo zwanziger , long a klinsmann supporter , said he would give the coach more than the few days he asked for to make up his mind .

but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler . let me admit one thing right away : i 've never been a dedicated follower of fussball .
i do n't know much about the sport and am highly unlikely to become a regular visitor to berlin 's olympiastadion - or any other , for that matter - during soccer season .
a month ago , i demonstratively boycotted the general excitement in the office as germany played costa rica in the world cup opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks good on him but silly on grown-ups and then it hit me .
like tens of millions of my fellow countrymen , i caught the bug that let perfectly reasonable human beings run around town with a clip-on mohican in black , red and yellow -lrb- the yellow - of course - is meant to be golden , but for some reason the makers of products in germany 's national colors never seem to get that right -rrb- . but back to that bug .
i 've been watching games whenever possible , working on the appropriate screams and hand gestures that are required of any self-respecting soccer fan .
when i realized that i 'd be spending the better part of tuesday 's fateful semi-final between germany and italy on a plane , i secretly hoped that the airline would - in a grand gesture of patriotism - broadcast the game live in the air . a savi n g grace ? unfortunately it did n't , leaving me to witness the last , gruesome minutes of the game in a bar at berlin 's airport after landing .
heading home on the subway , i watched the train fill with thoroughly depressed german fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : c 'mon , guys , it 's only a game i watched a boy slump to the ground and hide his tears behind the black , red and yellow hat he was still wearing .
i watched a young woman stroke a neatly folded german flag in her lap as she glanced at her downbeat boyfriend with worried eyes .
i watched a grumpy teenager in his original german team soccer jersey , who looked like he was ready to punch someone until his father told him to look at an advertisement on the window behind him . " jesus rettet , " it read .
jesus saves . germa n y 's lesso n the teen chuckled and suddenly it dawned on me .
while germany 's fourth of july might have been incredibly painful , it could teach the country a lesson that 's much more important than winning the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even michael ballack could n't help but cry which lesson ?
that it 's okay to lose , especially after giving it your best - both on the pitch and on the streets .
that germans seem to have won something that 's much more important than the short-lived joy of a weltmeister title : the ability to celebrate their team and their country without making others feel threatened by a new-found , friendly patriotism . last night , the streets fell silent .
they lacked the honking concerts that followed the recent victories of germany 's soccer team .
but this morning , the black , red and yellow flags were still flying atop cars and germans were looking forward to cheering for their guys in their final world cup game for third place on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to disappear from germany 's streets any time soon " now more than ever , " read the shirt that one tv commentator put on after tuesday 's match .
he praised " our " performance and said that germany 's young team has a bright future ahead . as far as i know , the european championships are coming up in 2008 .

the pesticide was banned in the us and uk in the 1970s , but it is still used in some countries to kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes .
it was already known ddt was linked to premature births and low birthweight .
the university of california berkeley researchers say their findings , published in pediatrics , should be borne in mind when addressing malaria .
ddt , an organochlorine , persists in the environment long after use , accumulating in the food chain and in fatty tissues of animals and humans .
over time , it degrades into dde and ddd , which have similar chemical and physical properties .
thirty-three years after its use was banned in the us , ddt is still detectable in about five to 10 % of people , while dde is detectable in nearly everyone .
breastfeeding protection the uc berkeley researchers measured blood levels of ddt and one of its breakdown products , dde , in 360 pregnant women , the majority of whom were born in mexico , where agricultural use of the chemical was only banned in 2000 .
we need to think of ways to protect women and children dr brenda eskenazi , uc berkeley factors including age , income , education , marital and work status , the child 's gender , duration of breastfeeding and the quality of the home environment for young children were considered .
the researchers tested the mental and physical skills of the women 's babies at six , 12 and 24 months using established tests to measure the children 's development .
for each tenfold increase in ddt levels measured in the mother , the team found a corresponding two to three-point decrease in the children 's mental development scores at 12 and 24 months .
children with the highest ddt exposures in the womb were associated with a seven to 10-point decrease in test scores , compared to the lowest exposures .
when the children 's physical skills were measured , there were two-point decreases in children 's scores at six and 12 months for each tenfold increase in ddt levels in the mothers .
similar , but weaker effects , were linked to dde exposure .
the team also found that the longer babies were breastfed for , the better they scored on the developmental tests - even though they would have been exposed to ddt through the milk .
chemical delivery dr brenda eskenazi , who led the research , said : " people need to consider these data if they are going to continue using ddt or reintroduce it in countries where it 's been banned .
" given the impact of malaria on child health , i 'm not saying that we should n't use it .
" but if we do , we need to think of ways to protect women and children . "
the researchers plan to continue to follow the children as they develop .
professor richard sharpe , of the medical research council 's human reproductive sciences unit in edinburgh , said : " the older the woman before her first breastfeeding episode and the longer and the higher her ddt exposure has been , the greater will be the amount of chemical delivered to the baby .
" so the first baby gets the worst of the chemicals stored in the mum 's fat .

the pesticide was banned in the us and uk in the 1970s , but it is still used in some countries to kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes .
it was already known ddt was linked to premature births and low birthweight .
the university of california berkeley researchers say their findings , published in pediatrics , should be borne in mind when addressing malaria .
ddt , an organochlorine , persists in the environment long after use , accumulating in the food chain and in fatty tissues of animals and humans .
over time , it degrades into dde and ddd , which have similar chemical and physical properties .
thirty-three years after its use was banned in the us , ddt is still detectable in about five to 10 % of people , while dde is detectable in nearly everyone .
breastfeeding protection the uc berkeley researchers measured blood levels of ddt and one of its breakdown products , dde , in 360 pregnant women , the majority of whom were born in mexico , where agricultural use of the chemical was only banned in 2000 .
we need to think of ways to protect women and children dr brenda eskenazi , uc berkeley factors including age , income , education , marital and work status , the child 's gender , duration of breastfeeding and the quality of the home environment for young children were considered .
the researchers tested the mental and physical skills of the women 's babies at six , 12 and 24 months using established tests to measure the children 's development .
for each tenfold increase in ddt levels measured in the mother , the team found a corresponding two to three-point decrease in the children 's mental development scores at 12 and 24 months .
children with the highest ddt exposures in the womb were associated with a seven to 10-point decrease in test scores , compared to the lowest exposures .
when the children 's physical skills were measured , there were two-point decreases in children 's scores at six and 12 months for each tenfold increase in ddt levels in the mothers .
similar , but weaker effects , were linked to dde exposure .
the team also found that the longer babies were breastfed for , the better they scored on the developmental tests - even though they would have been exposed to ddt through the milk .
chemical delivery dr brenda eskenazi , who led the research , said : " people need to consider these data if they are going to continue using ddt or reintroduce it in countries where it 's been banned .
" given the impact of malaria on child health , i 'm not saying that we should n't use it .
" but if we do , we need to think of ways to protect women and children . "
the researchers plan to continue to follow the children as they develop .
professor richard sharpe , of the medical research council 's human reproductive sciences unit in edinburgh , said : " the older the woman before her first breastfeeding episode and the longer and the higher her ddt exposure has been , the greater will be the amount of chemical delivered to the baby .
" so the first baby gets the worst of the chemicals stored in the mum 's fat .
" there may also be a bonus to the mum in that she is ridding herself and her fat tissue of the chemicals in question and because some of these chemicals are potentially implicated in the development of breast cancer - the breast is mainly fat .

the two nations are launching urgent diplomatic discussions , including talks at the united nations security council .
from washington , the word is that the launches were provocative , but not an immediate threat .
japan called them extremely regrettable , and said it was considering sanctions .
australia , whose government is close to washington on security matters , also condemned the move .
if north korea intended to attract the world 's attention , it succeeded .
but to what end ?
china 's position these launches may have been a gesture of diplomatic defiance - albeit with a tinge of embarrassment over a key rocket failure .
there will be discussions in the un security council - but probably not much in the way of immediate action as the key parties gauge each other 's reactions .
these latest developments sharpen the debate over the best way of reviving the stalled six-party talks these missile firings put china - perhaps the closest thing north korea has to an ally - in a difficult position .
washington is likely to argue it is time to be tough with north korea .
but will china and south korea interpret the missile firings as evidence that pyongyang is not susceptible to pressure ?
and what does that do to the chances of a united response ?
also , what pressures , like sanctions , could usefully be applied anyway ?
the missile question must be seen in the context of broader concerns about north korea 's nuclear weapons developments , what they mean for stability in the region , and more general worries about weapons proliferation - although a significant test failure may raise new questions about just how advanced pyongyang 's weapons programmes really are .
these latest developments certainly sharpen the debate over the best way of reviving the stalled six-party nuclear talks with the north .
they will hardly make the bush administration more willing to compromise .
but they have also reignited complaints from domestic critics of the administration that it has failed to engage diplomatically with north korea for years .

the warning has come from a police and environment agency team which is patrolling stretches of the river in runnymede , elmbridge and spelthorne .
police in north surrey said there were recent reports of people jumping from bridges at desborough cut in shepperton and teddington lock in west london .
metal or glass and discarded shopping trolleys underwater are a threat .
' real danger ' " bridge jumping is a real concern to us , " said river thames patrol officer , carl walters .
" the water 's depth and speed of current are difficult to gauge , there may be sharp objects hidden in the water and being struck by a boat is a real danger as boats can not stop dead or manoeuvre quickly . "
mr walters said people could enjoy the water during the summer months through supervised canoe , sailing or boat clubs .
ch insp paul smith added : " we have had reports in the past of bridge jumping at staines and walton bridges , and unfortunately there have been fatalities in previous years where swimmers have got into difficulty . "
the environment agency said people should not attempt to swim across the thames .

clamped cars will only be released to their owners on production of a tax disc and payment of £ 80 .
if the cars are removed , the release cost rises to £ 160 plus £ 15 per day .

unclaimed vehicles may be crushed after seven days .
owners of untaxed vehicles also face prosecution with fines of up to £ 1,000 plus the back tax owed and court costs .

ursula andress said the secret of her success was the dr no bikini .

it has weathered scandal , shrugged off the fads and whims of fashion , been celebrated as helping with the emancipation of women and lambasted as turning women into objects of desire .
its wearers have passed into legend , becoming iconic images of 20th century culture .
who can forget that 1962 dr no moment when ursula andress , as bond girl honeychile rider , emerges from the sea in a white bikini , knife tucked into a wide belt .
so iconic was the look that it was repeated 40 years later by halle berry in the bond movie die another day .
in 2001 , the dr no bikini sold at auction for $ 61,500 .
then there was brigitte bardot who set pulses racing when she appeared in her bikini in the 1957 film and god created woman .
raquel welch 's animal skin two- piece in one million years bc made her an instant pin-up girl .
female expression historically , the bikini is more than 1,700 years old , according to mosaics dating from 300ad at the villa romana del casale in sicily , which depict girls exercising in bikinis .
but it took off as a fashion item in the late 1950s .
ursula andress 's dr no look was so iconic it was repeated by halle berry .
photo : corbis - the bikini book -lrb- assouline -rrb- the bikini became a symbol of female expression , says american writer and former model kelly killoren bensimon , who has written the bikini book to celebrate its birthday .
" it really gave people confidence , " she told the bbc news website .
" the bikini is emblematic of freedom .
it 's about fun , it 's about play , it 's a lifestyle .
" it celebrates athletes , models , dancers and real people . "
ms bensimon puts the bikini 's longevity down to its scandalous inception .
" the bikini is associated with scandal and that 's why it survived , " she said .
certainly the two-piece had a hard time convincing the public that it was ok for " decent " women to wear it .
invented by engineer " le bikini " , a suit of four triangles made from only 30 inches of fabric , made its debut in paris in 1946 .
unable to find a model who would wear it , the bikini 's creator louis reard enlisted a nude dancer to pose for photographs .
brigette bardot sparked a french craze for " le bikini " mr reard was a french engineer by profession but in the mid-1940s , he was running his mother 's lingerie business .
he had noticed women on the beaches of st tropez rolling up their bathing suits to try to get a better tan .
he and french designer jacques heim were in competition to produce the world 's smallest swimsuit .
while mr heim 's two-piece was the first to be worn on the beach , it was mr reard that gave the bikini its memorable name .
it was debuted shortly after the first us post-war nuclear tests on the south pacific bikini atoll .
words like atomic were beginning to be used by the media to describe something sensational and , no doubt , mr reard reasoned that the excitement the bikini would cause would equal that of the bomb .
banned the bikini certainly caused a sensation - but few women were prepared to wear it .
one of the main problems was that the bikini exposed the navel and that was frowned on .
until , that is , brigitte bardot sparked the french craze and st tropez was set alight by women in two-pieces .
st tropez is the spiritual home of the bikini but it was too much for conservative america , where modern girl magazine sneered : " it is hardly necessary to waste words over the so-called bikini since it is inconceivable that any girl with tact and decency would ever wear such a thing . "
however , as the sexual revolution in the 1960s took hold , so did the bikini - except in catholic countries , that is , where it was banned .
it gained acceptance and clout and made its own contribution to the changing relationship between men and women .
still popular french fashion historian olivier saillard argues that the bikini imposed itself due to " the power of women , and not the power of fashion " .
" the emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women , " he told afp .
the emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women olivier saillard , fashion historian brian hyland sung about an " itsy-bitsy teenie-weenie yellow polka-dot bikini " in the 1960s and playboy first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962 .
two years later , it featured on the cover of sports illustrated , giving it an acceptable edge .
it was no longer just associated with louche sexuality .
in the 1980s , the bikini suffered a dip in its popularity .
today , however , it is going strong again .
us-based market research company npd group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped by 80 % in two years .
teenagers and young women are said to be the major buyers , but women over 30 make up an increasing share .
snapshot some argue that the key to the bikini 's re-found popularity is the ageing baby boomers who signed up to the fitness-obsessed culture .
kathy peiss , a professor of women 's history at the university of massachusetts argues that this baby boomer group is " inculcated with the idea that they wo n't ever grow old " .
for some , however , it is the other end of the market that causes concern .
joan jacobs brumberg , author of the body project : an intimate history of american girls , argues that the bikini is able to exert a noose-like grip on the psyche and physical health of girls and women .
" american girls and women have been stripped bare by a sexually expressive culture whose beauty dictates have exerted a major toll on their physical and emotional health , " she writes .
there is , however , no doubt that the power of the bikini will be debated for many years to come .

us officials said the taepodong missile - thought capable of reaching alaska - failed shortly after take-off , while the others fell into the sea of japan .
the us called the tests " provocative " and japan has announced sanctions .
the un security council is due to hold an emergency meeting later on wednesday to discuss the developments .
the closed un session was requested by japan , which said it was co-ordinating its response to the missile tests with the us and other countries .
have your say it 's regrettable that a poor country invests its resources in weaponry john , uk send us your comments japanese and south korean military are on high alert in the wake of the tests , and share prices have fallen in both countries .
australia said it expected north korea to make further test firings .
strong condemnation pyongyang remained defiant .
a foreign ministry official said such launches were a matter of national sovereignty , japanese media reported .
the north koreans have again clearly isolated themselves tony snow , white house press secretary in quotes : missile reaction diplomatic debate over tests n korea 's missile programme in the us , white house spokesman tony snow said the launches " demonstrate north korea 's intent to intimidate other states " and washington would take necessary steps to protect itself and its allies .
president george w bush is sending assistant secretary of state christopher hill out to the region .
japan - one of north korea 's harshest critics , and in easy reach of a long-range missile - announced bans on the entry of north korean officials , chartered flights and a ferry .
in south korea - which has been anxious to promote reconciliation with its unpredictable northern neighbour - the government called an emergency cabinet meeting soon after the tests took place .
see the possible range of north korea 's missiles south korea has consistently opposed the imposition of sanctions , but in recent days it warned of cutting food aid to the north should the missile tests go ahead .
analysts said the firing - north korea 's first test of a long-range missile since a self-imposed moratorium in 1999 - would also seriously damage prospects for stalled international talks on the north 's nuclear programme .
heightened alert according to us officials , the north fired at least six missiles over a four-hour period , beginning at 0332 japan time -lrb- 1832 gmt -rrb- .
south korea has confirmed that five of the missiles were medium-range versions of the old soviet scud missile .
the sixth was the long-range taepodong-2 , fired from the musudan-ri missile base .
the taepodong-2 crashed 42 seconds after it was launched , according to us sources .
the us and north korea 's neighbours have been on heightened alert in recent weeks amid suspicions that pyongyang was preparing to launch the taepodong-2 , which has a range of up to 6,000 km -lrb- 3,730 miles -rrb- , putting parts of the us within striking distance .
the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul says the north has been feeling under pressure and ignored in recent months , with the us refusing to negotiate on its demands over its nuclear plans .
long-running talks over north korea 's nuclear capabilities have stalled , with six-party negotiations on the issue being repeatedly postponed as neither washington nor pyongyang are prepared to give ground .
north korea may see this action as a way to get attention and break the diplomatic log jam , our correspondent adds .
the tests came as the us celebrated its independence day holiday and launched the space shuttle from florida .
the last time north korea tested a long-range missile was in 1998 , when it launched a taepodong-1 over northern japan .

analysts said the firing - north korea 's first test of a long-range missile since a self-imposed moratorium in 1999 - would also seriously damage prospects for stalled international talks on the north 's nuclear programme .
heightened alert according to us officials , the north fired at least six missiles over a four-hour period , beginning at 0332 japan time -lrb- 1832 gmt -rrb- .
south korea has confirmed that five of the missiles were medium-range versions of the old soviet scud missile .
the sixth was the long-range taepodong-2 , fired from the musudan-ri missile base .
the taepodong-2 crashed 42 seconds after it was launched , according to us sources .
the us and north korea 's neighbours have been on heightened alert in recent weeks amid suspicions that pyongyang was preparing to launch the taepodong-2 , which has a range of up to 6,000 km -lrb- 3,730 miles -rrb- , putting parts of the us within striking distance .
the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul says the north has been feeling under pressure and ignored in recent months , with the us refusing to negotiate on its demands over its nuclear plans .
long-running talks over north korea 's nuclear capabilities have stalled , with six-party negotiations on the issue being repeatedly postponed as neither washington nor pyongyang are prepared to give ground .
north korea may see this action as a way to get attention and break the diplomatic log jam , our correspondent adds .
the tests came as the us celebrated its independence day holiday and launched the space shuttle from florida .
the last time north korea tested a long-range missile was in 1998 , when it launched a taepodong-1 over northern japan .

holyrood 's rural affairs committee called for a radical rethink on the controversial bill .
the bill contains plans to permit new crofts to be created anywhere in crofting areas .
it would also remove the requirement that the crofters commission approves every change in control of a croft .
the committee said many of the proposals would not be necessary if there was more committed enforcement of existing laws by the commission .
msps visited crofting communities in argyll , caithness , inverness , ross and cromarty , sutherland , orkney and shetland gathering evidence .
they said the biggest stumbling block for many witnesses was that the bill did nothing to stop speculation in croft land that would threaten the entire system .
crofters ' dissatisfaction convener sarah boyack also said crofters appeared to have a long-standing dissatisfaction with the commission 's practices .
she added : " crofters and others with an interest in crofting must be fully engaged in developing a modern vision for crofting , and then developing a structure of governance and accountability that will command respect . "
the committee wants the bill to be reconsidered by the executive and the commission 's track record to be looked at again .
the scottish national party also criticised the proposals , claiming that labour and liberal democrat ministers had ignored many of the submissions they had received .
there are more than 17,700 crofts in scotland , housing around 30,000 people .
