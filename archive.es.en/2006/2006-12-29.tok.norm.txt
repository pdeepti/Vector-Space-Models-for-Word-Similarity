in germany , the sport 's popularity is crashing as fast as the careers of many of its former stars . the austrian georg schlierenzauer is a 16-year-old student .
the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .
only one little thing needs to go wrong and you find yourself stuck in a very difficult situation . " jumpers lose their rhythm and most find it nearly impossible to regain it . dwindling interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german sven hannawald was enormously popular before he burned out in germany , as the popular ski jumping stars crashed and burned , spectators lost interest .
in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .
as the success of ski jumping in germany is on the line , pressure on athletes increases . since the " ski eagle " stopped jumping , the internet site skispringen.com , dedicated to the sport , has noticed a huge drop in the number of hits from germany , said peter siegel .
it reached a low point at the beginning of 2006 and has begun to go back up , he said . " if a german finishes in the top ten , that would be a success .
one can also hope that martin schmitt 's performance will finally increase . " nieminen is philosophical about his short-lived success . " the year i had was one that few athletes experience , " nieminen said .

the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .

in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .
as the success of ski jumping in germany is on the line , pressure on athletes increases . since the " ski eagle " stopped jumping , the internet site skispringen.com , dedicated to the sport , has noticed a huge drop in the number of hits from germany , said peter siegel .
it reached a low point at the beginning of 2006 and has begun to go back up , he said . " if a german finishes in the top ten , that would be a success .
one can also hope that martin schmitt 's performance will finally increase . " nieminen is philosophical about his short-lived success . " the year i had was one that few athletes experience , " nieminen said .

especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs .

especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs . " we are not seeking to slow down the pace of reforms , " kahrs said .
" all we are aiming for are well-crafted reforms that people can understand and accept .

" those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs . " we are not seeking to slow down the pace of reforms , " kahrs said .
" all we are aiming for are well-crafted reforms that people can understand and accept .
after all it ’ s the conservatives who are currently trying to block necessary changes . " problems on the right a senior member of the christian democrat ’ s sister party in bavaria , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , announced on thursday that the party would reject a health reform bill in the upper house of parliament representing germany ’ s 16 federal states , the bundesrat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health care reform plan is under threat the csu argues the proposals would jeopardize private health insurance companies which mainly insure affluent germans . so far conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democrat vice-chancellor franz müntefering have opted to stay out of the health-reform debate . apparently they are seeking to press ahead with a plan that foresees both implementing existing reforms and tackling new ones .
the two are said to be on the same wavelength on most issues .
but the going will be getting tougher for them as a minefield of special interests start letting their wishes known . uwe hessler -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in christmas address , german president urges more reform german president horst köhler has used his traditional christmas address to again set out his case for enacting far-reaching reforms in europe 's biggest economy .

in germany , the currency was quickly nicknamed the " teuro , " a play on the german word " teuer " which means expensive . it 's a regular gripe in germany , for example , that café owners have simply substituted deutschemark prices for euros , effectively doubling the cost of a coffee or beer . the belief can have serious economic consequences .
sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .

gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .
-lrb- 01.05.2006 -rrb- russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say .

" the british have a knack for that sort of thing , " said bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's g8 organizer , said recently . for germany , which assumes the g8 presidency for one year in january , what is important is the lasting change that such summits can achieve . " we want more to go back to the roots of the world economic summit as it was previously known , " added pfaffenbach .
" we 're concerned with the problems of the global economy . " the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - and russia .
germany is also taking over the six-month revolving presidency of the european union starting from january . africa again on the agenda under the british g8 presidency in 2005 , which culminated in the summit in gleneagles , scotland , pop stars such as u2 front man bono lent the proceedings that extra touch of glamour .
his live 8 rock concerts were the highlight of a high-profile campaign for debt relief of the world 's poorest nations .
bildunterschrift : protestors are already at work heiligendamm , an exclusive five-star resort on germany 's baltic coastline , is almost as plush as gleneagles .
and africa will again top the agenda this time around . but berlin wants to move on from the multi-billion-dollar debt relief agreed in gleneagles and instead urge african countries to take a more hands-on approach , fighting corruption and pushing for more democracy so as to create better conditions for foreign investment . g8 leaders will also tackle a whole host of drier-sounding issues , such as structural reforms in europe , the massive twin budget and trade deficits of the united states and china 's vast foreign currency reserves . a call for greater transparency a top-ranking government official from beijing will be present in heiligendamm , as well as representatives from other countries such as india , brazil , mexico and south africa , where the talks will cover wage levels and social standards , as well as product piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over as the eu president as well energy , too , will be on the agenda , with berlin looking to make progress on drawing up a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol on climate protection , which runs out in 2012 . another key issue will be germany 's campaign for greater transparency on the worldwide financial and capital markets . berlin has long campaigned for increased regulation of so-called hedge funds - highly speculative and aggressive investment funds that are estimated to manage more than a trillion dollars in assets worldwide . global system needs stability while germany does not have a big hedge fund sector itself , it argues that greater control is needed for the stability of the global financial system . the issue will top the agenda of a meeting of g7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in the western german city of essen in february . while both the us and britain have been reluctant to back the campaign in the past , there appears to be signs of some common ground being found . berlin appears ready to scale back its ambitions of drawing up concrete measures , while washington seems to be coming around to the idea that action could be necessary , especially in the wake of the collapse of us hedge fund amaranth advisors . " one must n't be too ambitious , " said pfaffenbach .
" you ca n't simply take an ax to it and want to install rigid rules .
that wo n't happen .
but transparency has never hurt anyone .
a joint final statement calling for more transparency would be feasible and desirable .

andreas troge , president of the agency , said that could reduce the production of climate-damaging exhaust emissions by up to 30 percent . limited support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slowing traffic could help the environment the speed limit proposal seems to have support from politicians in both parties of the ruling coalition government , a german newspaper reported . " i would argue that a speed limit makes sense on the basis of climate protection , " the social democratic party 's transport politician heidi wright told the berliner zeitung . the european union recently dismissed germany 's plan for cutting co2 emissions as extremely inadequate .
that has left the government in the position of proposing a more ambitious plan that will also keep utility companies happy . german utilities have warned that a more ambitious plan would risk jobs and the current economic upswing .
but not everyone is convinced slowing down drivers is the best way for germany to cut emissions . stop speeding on the autobahn ?
no way # b # and politically , it wo n't be easy for the government to curb germany 's speed demons .
driving fast on the autobahn is considered a sacred right by many . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , as well as the major automobile clubs , have spoken out against a general speed limit .
tiefensee pointed out that 40 percent of the autobahn already has speed limits .
he feels its better to push for innovations in fuels and engines . peter meyer , head of the powerful german automobile association adac called the speed limit idea a foolish , outdated proposal in the tabloid bild zeitung . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

in germany , the sport 's popularity is crashing as fast as the careers of many of its former stars . the austrian georg schlierenzauer is a 16-year-old student .
the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .
only one little thing needs to go wrong and you find yourself stuck in a very difficult situation . " jumpers lose their rhythm and most find it nearly impossible to regain it . dwindling interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german sven hannawald was enormously popular before he burned out in germany , as the popular ski jumping stars crashed and burned , spectators lost interest .
in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .
as the success of ski jumping in germany is on the line , pressure on athletes increases . since the " ski eagle " stopped jumping , the internet site skispringen.com , dedicated to the sport , has noticed a huge drop in the number of hits from germany , said peter siegel .
it reached a low point at the beginning of 2006 and has begun to go back up , he said . " if a german finishes in the top ten , that would be a success .
one can also hope that martin schmitt 's performance will finally increase . " nieminen is philosophical about his short-lived success . " the year i had was one that few athletes experience , " nieminen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.12.2006 euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the euro 's strength , europeans are n't entirely convinced of the currency 's merits for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .
despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive . according to the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , the euro recently surpassed the dollar in terms of the amount of bills in circulation worldwide . during the christmas holidays , the ecb reported a record number of 628 billion euros in banknotes in circulation .
that compares with $ 760 billion -lrb- 585 billion euros -rrb- . " for the first time the euro overtook the dollar related to value , " a european central bank spokesman told the süddeutsche zeitung . " teuro " instead of euro ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans feel groceries are now more expensive despite the euro 's new-found muscle as it nears its fifth anniversary on jan 1 , many europeans from the 12-member eurozone remain deeply skeptical about their common currency . seen as an important step toward deeper european integration , the vast initiative was sold to citizens on its economic merits , promising higher growth and protection from the currency crises that had regularly hit the continent . but public support for the single currency has fallen since its launch in cash form on january 1 , 2002 , when 304 million europeans swapped their national currencies for a common means of exchange . many feel that since its introduction in 2002 , coffee , beer , gasoline and many other basics have become more expensive .
in germany , the currency was quickly nicknamed the " teuro , " a play on the german word " teuer " which means expensive . it 's a regular gripe in germany , for example , that café owners have simply substituted deutschemark prices for euros , effectively doubling the cost of a coffee or beer . the belief can have serious economic consequences .
sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .
in the past decade , the average perceived inflation in germany was " approximately four times higher than the official inflation rate , " the afp news service reported . perception is everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is widely perceived to have raised prices " if the german economy has any interest in sustainably reviving consumption , it should work towards significantly lowering the perception of inflation among consumers , " brachinger said . brachinger 's methods and conclusions have been fiercely contested by bundesbank economists .
but there 's no denying that a gap between real and felt inflation exists . just before the changeover to the euro , fruits , vegetables and petrol increased substantially in price .
consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .
however the european central bank has recently become a target for criticism itself , particularly from french politicians , amid a debate about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen . euro falters on the political front on the political front , the euro was once seen as being a catalyst for deeper integration , but the process of bringing member states into a closer political union has foundered in recent times . although the european union has expanded since its introduction , welcoming 10 new members in 2004 , the rejection of the european constitution by french and dutch voters in 2005 was a setback for the eu project .
there are also signs that the allure of the euro has fallen for candidate countries . slovenia is set to become the 13th member of the eurozone on january 1 , but other new eu members are now showing less enthusiasm than before for jettisoning their national currencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .

it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .

the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen .

the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.12.2006 euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the euro 's strength , europeans are n't entirely convinced of the currency 's merits for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .
despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive . according to the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , the euro recently surpassed the dollar in terms of the amount of bills in circulation worldwide . during the christmas holidays , the ecb reported a record number of 628 billion euros in banknotes in circulation .
that compares with $ 760 billion -lrb- 585 billion euros -rrb- . " for the first time the euro overtook the dollar related to value , " a european central bank spokesman told the süddeutsche zeitung . " teuro " instead of euro ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans feel groceries are now more expensive despite the euro 's new-found muscle as it nears its fifth anniversary on jan 1 , many europeans from the 12-member eurozone remain deeply skeptical about their common currency . seen as an important step toward deeper european integration , the vast initiative was sold to citizens on its economic merits , promising higher growth and protection from the currency crises that had regularly hit the continent . but public support for the single currency has fallen since its launch in cash form on january 1 , 2002 , when 304 million europeans swapped their national currencies for a common means of exchange . many feel that since its introduction in 2002 , coffee , beer , gasoline and many other basics have become more expensive .
in germany , the currency was quickly nicknamed the " teuro , " a play on the german word " teuer " which means expensive . it 's a regular gripe in germany , for example , that café owners have simply substituted deutschemark prices for euros , effectively doubling the cost of a coffee or beer . the belief can have serious economic consequences .
sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .
in the past decade , the average perceived inflation in germany was " approximately four times higher than the official inflation rate , " the afp news service reported . perception is everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is widely perceived to have raised prices " if the german economy has any interest in sustainably reviving consumption , it should work towards significantly lowering the perception of inflation among consumers , " brachinger said . brachinger 's methods and conclusions have been fiercely contested by bundesbank economists .
but there 's no denying that a gap between real and felt inflation exists . just before the changeover to the euro , fruits , vegetables and petrol increased substantially in price .
consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .
however the european central bank has recently become a target for criticism itself , particularly from french politicians , amid a debate about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen . euro falters on the political front on the political front , the euro was once seen as being a catalyst for deeper integration , but the process of bringing member states into a closer political union has foundered in recent times . although the european union has expanded since its introduction , welcoming 10 new members in 2004 , the rejection of the european constitution by french and dutch voters in 2005 was a setback for the eu project .
there are also signs that the allure of the euro has fallen for candidate countries . slovenia is set to become the 13th member of the eurozone on january 1 , but other new eu members are now showing less enthusiasm than before for jettisoning their national currencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.12.2006 russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row could affect russian gas supplies to europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .

" i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "

the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .

despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive . according to the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , the euro recently surpassed the dollar in terms of the amount of bills in circulation worldwide . during the christmas holidays , the ecb reported a record number of 628 billion euros in banknotes in circulation .
that compares with $ 760 billion -lrb- 585 billion euros -rrb- . " for the first time the euro overtook the dollar related to value , " a european central bank spokesman told the süddeutsche zeitung . " teuro " instead of euro ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans feel groceries are now more expensive despite the euro 's new-found muscle as it nears its fifth anniversary on jan 1 , many europeans from the 12-member eurozone remain deeply skeptical about their common currency . seen as an important step toward deeper european integration , the vast initiative was sold to citizens on its economic merits , promising higher growth and protection from the currency crises that had regularly hit the continent . but public support for the single currency has fallen since its launch in cash form on january 1 , 2002 , when 304 million europeans swapped their national currencies for a common means of exchange . many feel that since its introduction in 2002 , coffee , beer , gasoline and many other basics have become more expensive .
in germany , the currency was quickly nicknamed the " teuro , " a play on the german word " teuer " which means expensive . it 's a regular gripe in germany , for example , that café owners have simply substituted deutschemark prices for euros , effectively doubling the cost of a coffee or beer . the belief can have serious economic consequences .
sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .
in the past decade , the average perceived inflation in germany was " approximately four times higher than the official inflation rate , " the afp news service reported . perception is everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is widely perceived to have raised prices " if the german economy has any interest in sustainably reviving consumption , it should work towards significantly lowering the perception of inflation among consumers , " brachinger said . brachinger 's methods and conclusions have been fiercely contested by bundesbank economists .
but there 's no denying that a gap between real and felt inflation exists . just before the changeover to the euro , fruits , vegetables and petrol increased substantially in price .
consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .
however the european central bank has recently become a target for criticism itself , particularly from french politicians , amid a debate about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen . euro falters on the political front on the political front , the euro was once seen as being a catalyst for deeper integration , but the process of bringing member states into a closer political union has foundered in recent times . although the european union has expanded since its introduction , welcoming 10 new members in 2004 , the rejection of the european constitution by french and dutch voters in 2005 was a setback for the eu project .
there are also signs that the allure of the euro has fallen for candidate countries . slovenia is set to become the 13th member of the eurozone on january 1 , but other new eu members are now showing less enthusiasm than before for jettisoning their national currencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.12.2006 russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row could affect russian gas supplies to europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .
-lrb- 01.05.2006 -rrb- russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.12.2006 russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row could affect russian gas supplies to europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .
-lrb- 01.05.2006 -rrb- russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say .

in germany , the sport 's popularity is crashing as fast as the careers of many of its former stars . the austrian georg schlierenzauer is a 16-year-old student .
the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .

in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .

" i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "

the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values .

belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis .

in germany , the sport 's popularity is crashing as fast as the careers of many of its former stars . the austrian georg schlierenzauer is a 16-year-old student .
the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .
only one little thing needs to go wrong and you find yourself stuck in a very difficult situation . " jumpers lose their rhythm and most find it nearly impossible to regain it . dwindling interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german sven hannawald was enormously popular before he burned out in germany , as the popular ski jumping stars crashed and burned , spectators lost interest .
in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .
as the success of ski jumping in germany is on the line , pressure on athletes increases . since the " ski eagle " stopped jumping , the internet site skispringen.com , dedicated to the sport , has noticed a huge drop in the number of hits from germany , said peter siegel .
it reached a low point at the beginning of 2006 and has begun to go back up , he said . " if a german finishes in the top ten , that would be a success .
one can also hope that martin schmitt 's performance will finally increase . " nieminen is philosophical about his short-lived success . " the year i had was one that few athletes experience , " nieminen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 29.12.2006 social democrat leader warns against too many reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just beck , several germans too have protested against various new reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more . social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck appears bent on hitting the emergency brakes on plans for more sweeping changes in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck says enough is enough cuts in unemployment and welfare payments , a controversial health reform and higher sales taxes , he told the german daily newspaper die welt , had sorely tested the endurance levels of the population .
especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.12.2006 ski jumping suffers from fallen stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , the farther they jump , the harder they fall the four hills ski jumping tournament this year will likely be won by little-known athletes .
in germany , the sport 's popularity is crashing as fast as the careers of many of its former stars . the austrian georg schlierenzauer is a 16-year-old student .
the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .
only one little thing needs to go wrong and you find yourself stuck in a very difficult situation . " jumpers lose their rhythm and most find it nearly impossible to regain it . dwindling interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german sven hannawald was enormously popular before he burned out in germany , as the popular ski jumping stars crashed and burned , spectators lost interest .
in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .
as the success of ski jumping in germany is on the line , pressure on athletes increases . since the " ski eagle " stopped jumping , the internet site skispringen.com , dedicated to the sport , has noticed a huge drop in the number of hits from germany , said peter siegel .
it reached a low point at the beginning of 2006 and has begun to go back up , he said . " if a german finishes in the top ten , that would be a success .
one can also hope that martin schmitt 's performance will finally increase . " nieminen is philosophical about his short-lived success . " the year i had was one that few athletes experience , " nieminen said .
" you have to be content and feel lucky to have experienced that .
despite everything , it 's only a sport .
it 's not everything in life .

andreas troge , president of the agency , said that could reduce the production of climate-damaging exhaust emissions by up to 30 percent . limited support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slowing traffic could help the environment the speed limit proposal seems to have support from politicians in both parties of the ruling coalition government , a german newspaper reported . " i would argue that a speed limit makes sense on the basis of climate protection , " the social democratic party 's transport politician heidi wright told the berliner zeitung . the european union recently dismissed germany 's plan for cutting co2 emissions as extremely inadequate .
that has left the government in the position of proposing a more ambitious plan that will also keep utility companies happy . german utilities have warned that a more ambitious plan would risk jobs and the current economic upswing .
but not everyone is convinced slowing down drivers is the best way for germany to cut emissions . stop speeding on the autobahn ?
no way # b # and politically , it wo n't be easy for the government to curb germany 's speed demons .
driving fast on the autobahn is considered a sacred right by many . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , as well as the major automobile clubs , have spoken out against a general speed limit .
tiefensee pointed out that 40 percent of the autobahn already has speed limits .
he feels its better to push for innovations in fuels and engines . peter meyer , head of the powerful german automobile association adac called the speed limit idea a foolish , outdated proposal in the tabloid bild zeitung . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .
-lrb- 19.12.2006 -rrb- germany says eu 's emissions requirements are unreasonable just before germany assumes both the eu and g8 presidencies , the european commission has said berlin is n't doing enough to reduce co2 emissions , although germany has declared climate policy a top priority .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .

in germany , the currency was quickly nicknamed the " teuro , " a play on the german word " teuer " which means expensive . it 's a regular gripe in germany , for example , that café owners have simply substituted deutschemark prices for euros , effectively doubling the cost of a coffee or beer . the belief can have serious economic consequences .
sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .

consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .

especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.12.2006 russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row could affect russian gas supplies to europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .
-lrb- 01.05.2006 -rrb- russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say .

" i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .

in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.12.2006 russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row could affect russian gas supplies to europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

andreas troge , president of the agency , said that could reduce the production of climate-damaging exhaust emissions by up to 30 percent . limited support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slowing traffic could help the environment the speed limit proposal seems to have support from politicians in both parties of the ruling coalition government , a german newspaper reported . " i would argue that a speed limit makes sense on the basis of climate protection , " the social democratic party 's transport politician heidi wright told the berliner zeitung . the european union recently dismissed germany 's plan for cutting co2 emissions as extremely inadequate .
that has left the government in the position of proposing a more ambitious plan that will also keep utility companies happy . german utilities have warned that a more ambitious plan would risk jobs and the current economic upswing .
but not everyone is convinced slowing down drivers is the best way for germany to cut emissions . stop speeding on the autobahn ?
no way # b # and politically , it wo n't be easy for the government to curb germany 's speed demons .
driving fast on the autobahn is considered a sacred right by many . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , as well as the major automobile clubs , have spoken out against a general speed limit .
tiefensee pointed out that 40 percent of the autobahn already has speed limits .
he feels its better to push for innovations in fuels and engines . peter meyer , head of the powerful german automobile association adac called the speed limit idea a foolish , outdated proposal in the tabloid bild zeitung . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

his live 8 rock concerts were the highlight of a high-profile campaign for debt relief of the world 's poorest nations .
bildunterschrift : protestors are already at work heiligendamm , an exclusive five-star resort on germany 's baltic coastline , is almost as plush as gleneagles .
and africa will again top the agenda this time around . but berlin wants to move on from the multi-billion-dollar debt relief agreed in gleneagles and instead urge african countries to take a more hands-on approach , fighting corruption and pushing for more democracy so as to create better conditions for foreign investment . g8 leaders will also tackle a whole host of drier-sounding issues , such as structural reforms in europe , the massive twin budget and trade deficits of the united states and china 's vast foreign currency reserves . a call for greater transparency a top-ranking government official from beijing will be present in heiligendamm , as well as representatives from other countries such as india , brazil , mexico and south africa , where the talks will cover wage levels and social standards , as well as product piracy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over as the eu president as well energy , too , will be on the agenda , with berlin looking to make progress on drawing up a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol on climate protection , which runs out in 2012 . another key issue will be germany 's campaign for greater transparency on the worldwide financial and capital markets . berlin has long campaigned for increased regulation of so-called hedge funds - highly speculative and aggressive investment funds that are estimated to manage more than a trillion dollars in assets worldwide . global system needs stability while germany does not have a big hedge fund sector itself , it argues that greater control is needed for the stability of the global financial system . the issue will top the agenda of a meeting of g7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in the western german city of essen in february . while both the us and britain have been reluctant to back the campaign in the past , there appears to be signs of some common ground being found . berlin appears ready to scale back its ambitions of drawing up concrete measures , while washington seems to be coming around to the idea that action could be necessary , especially in the wake of the collapse of us hedge fund amaranth advisors . " one must n't be too ambitious , " said pfaffenbach .
" you ca n't simply take an ax to it and want to install rigid rules .
that wo n't happen .
but transparency has never hurt anyone .
a joint final statement calling for more transparency would be feasible and desirable .

in germany , the sport 's popularity is crashing as fast as the careers of many of its former stars . the austrian georg schlierenzauer is a 16-year-old student .
the norwegian anders jacobsen is 20 and works full time in the summer as a plumber .
both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .
only one little thing needs to go wrong and you find yourself stuck in a very difficult situation . " jumpers lose their rhythm and most find it nearly impossible to regain it . dwindling interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german sven hannawald was enormously popular before he burned out in germany , as the popular ski jumping stars crashed and burned , spectators lost interest .
in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .
as the success of ski jumping in germany is on the line , pressure on athletes increases . since the " ski eagle " stopped jumping , the internet site skispringen.com , dedicated to the sport , has noticed a huge drop in the number of hits from germany , said peter siegel .
it reached a low point at the beginning of 2006 and has begun to go back up , he said . " if a german finishes in the top ten , that would be a success .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.12.2006 euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the euro 's strength , europeans are n't entirely convinced of the currency 's merits for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .
despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive . according to the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , the euro recently surpassed the dollar in terms of the amount of bills in circulation worldwide . during the christmas holidays , the ecb reported a record number of 628 billion euros in banknotes in circulation .
that compares with $ 760 billion -lrb- 585 billion euros -rrb- . " for the first time the euro overtook the dollar related to value , " a european central bank spokesman told the süddeutsche zeitung . " teuro " instead of euro ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans feel groceries are now more expensive despite the euro 's new-found muscle as it nears its fifth anniversary on jan 1 , many europeans from the 12-member eurozone remain deeply skeptical about their common currency . seen as an important step toward deeper european integration , the vast initiative was sold to citizens on its economic merits , promising higher growth and protection from the currency crises that had regularly hit the continent . but public support for the single currency has fallen since its launch in cash form on january 1 , 2002 , when 304 million europeans swapped their national currencies for a common means of exchange . many feel that since its introduction in 2002 , coffee , beer , gasoline and many other basics have become more expensive .
in germany , the currency was quickly nicknamed the " teuro , " a play on the german word " teuer " which means expensive . it 's a regular gripe in germany , for example , that café owners have simply substituted deutschemark prices for euros , effectively doubling the cost of a coffee or beer . the belief can have serious economic consequences .
sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .
in the past decade , the average perceived inflation in germany was " approximately four times higher than the official inflation rate , " the afp news service reported . perception is everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is widely perceived to have raised prices " if the german economy has any interest in sustainably reviving consumption , it should work towards significantly lowering the perception of inflation among consumers , " brachinger said . brachinger 's methods and conclusions have been fiercely contested by bundesbank economists .
but there 's no denying that a gap between real and felt inflation exists . just before the changeover to the euro , fruits , vegetables and petrol increased substantially in price .
consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .
however the european central bank has recently become a target for criticism itself , particularly from french politicians , amid a debate about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen . euro falters on the political front on the political front , the euro was once seen as being a catalyst for deeper integration , but the process of bringing member states into a closer political union has foundered in recent times . although the european union has expanded since its introduction , welcoming 10 new members in 2004 , the rejection of the european constitution by french and dutch voters in 2005 was a setback for the eu project .
there are also signs that the allure of the euro has fallen for candidate countries . slovenia is set to become the 13th member of the eurozone on january 1 , but other new eu members are now showing less enthusiasm than before for jettisoning their national currencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .

" i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "

the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .

belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 29.12.2006 social democrat leader warns against too many reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just beck , several germans too have protested against various new reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more . social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck appears bent on hitting the emergency brakes on plans for more sweeping changes in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck says enough is enough cuts in unemployment and welfare payments , a controversial health reform and higher sales taxes , he told the german daily newspaper die welt , had sorely tested the endurance levels of the population .
especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs . " we are not seeking to slow down the pace of reforms , " kahrs said .
" all we are aiming for are well-crafted reforms that people can understand and accept .
after all it ’ s the conservatives who are currently trying to block necessary changes . " problems on the right a senior member of the christian democrat ’ s sister party in bavaria , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , announced on thursday that the party would reject a health reform bill in the upper house of parliament representing germany ’ s 16 federal states , the bundesrat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health care reform plan is under threat the csu argues the proposals would jeopardize private health insurance companies which mainly insure affluent germans . so far conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democrat vice-chancellor franz müntefering have opted to stay out of the health-reform debate . apparently they are seeking to press ahead with a plan that foresees both implementing existing reforms and tackling new ones .
the two are said to be on the same wavelength on most issues .
but the going will be getting tougher for them as a minefield of special interests start letting their wishes known . uwe hessler -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in christmas address , german president urges more reform german president horst köhler has used his traditional christmas address to again set out his case for enacting far-reaching reforms in europe 's biggest economy .
-lrb- 25.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's government and unions clash over reform process the german government and the country 's trade unions are accusing each other of hindering the reform process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.12.2006 russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row could affect russian gas supplies to europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .
the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia . russia and belarus are holding fresh talks friday to defuse a row over natural gas that threatens to halt imports to belarus and disrupt energy supplies to the european union beginning monday , jan 1 . with less than 100 hours to go before belarus must agree to a more than doubling of gas prices or see supplies cut , both sides expressed guarded hope . " we are as interested as the russian side in a result , " andrei zhukov , an aide to belarus ' energy minister , alexander ozerets , told afp in minsk . ' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about its energy dependence gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev told france 's le figaro on friday that belarus was engaging in " grotesque blackmail " and that european clients could face shortfalls . meetings in moscow and negotiations by telephone have taken place daily , ending each time without sign of a deal , raising the likelihood of a new year 's crisis similar to the cut-off of russian gas 12 months ago to ukraine , with knock-on effects through western europe . the cuts , during an exceptionally cold winter , exposed a lack of any real european union energy policy and awakened the bloc to the political power of natural resources . damaging moscow 's image gazprom insists that its price increases - already imposed on ukraine , georgia , and moldova - are part of a legitimate move to end soviet-era subsidies and charge accepted international rates . however the kremlin-connected gas giant 's rough tactics against russia 's smaller neighbours has damaged moscow 's image abroad and caused alarm in europe about what the european union sees as over-reliance on russian energy supplies . the eu commission says it is following the situation " very closely " and has called for a rapid settlement . " i call on the two parties to reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that does not put in question gas transits to the eu , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" the commission is following the situation very closely since it may affect gas supplies to the european union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusians are preparing for the gas cut-off piebalgs also said that the eu 's gas coordination group , which supervises the security of natural gas supplies , would meet in brussels to discuss the problem on january 4 .
the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .
" we may have to deal increasingly with governments whose interests are different from our own and who do not necessarily share our values . " playing down fears russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc .
belarus serves as the transit point for roughly 20 percent of russian gas flowing to europe , amounting to about five percent of europe 's total gas needs .
the other 80 percent of westward russian exports are piped via ukraine , which has offered to increase the transit of russian gas . that is why german economy minister michael glos , whose country takes over the eu presidency on monday , played down fears of a growing crisis . " there is no reason to fear a threat to supply security in germany thanks to existing storage capacity and the small amount of the supply actually sent via belarusian gas pipelines , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus threatens to stop gas deliveries to europe belarus implied that unless russian gas giant gazprom backs off of demands for a hefty price increase , it might keep gas from being transported through its pipelines to western europe .
-lrb- 27.12.2006 -rrb- poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .
-lrb- 01.05.2006 -rrb- russia aims to save face with ukraine gas deal russia 's decision to resolve the " gas war " with ukraine reflects kremlin concerns that the dispute could undermine its reputation in the west and even play into the hands of kiev 's pro-western leadership , analysts say .

especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs . " we are not seeking to slow down the pace of reforms , " kahrs said .
" all we are aiming for are well-crafted reforms that people can understand and accept .

in the past decade , the average perceived inflation in germany was " approximately four times higher than the official inflation rate , " the afp news service reported . perception is everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is widely perceived to have raised prices " if the german economy has any interest in sustainably reviving consumption , it should work towards significantly lowering the perception of inflation among consumers , " brachinger said . brachinger 's methods and conclusions have been fiercely contested by bundesbank economists .
but there 's no denying that a gap between real and felt inflation exists . just before the changeover to the euro , fruits , vegetables and petrol increased substantially in price .
consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .
however the european central bank has recently become a target for criticism itself , particularly from french politicians , amid a debate about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen . euro falters on the political front on the political front , the euro was once seen as being a catalyst for deeper integration , but the process of bringing member states into a closer political union has foundered in recent times . although the european union has expanded since its introduction , welcoming 10 new members in 2004 , the rejection of the european constitution by french and dutch voters in 2005 was a setback for the eu project .
there are also signs that the allure of the euro has fallen for candidate countries . slovenia is set to become the 13th member of the eurozone on january 1 , but other new eu members are now showing less enthusiasm than before for jettisoning their national currencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy .

both are little-known professional ski jumpers . they are among the favorites at the 55th annual four hills tournament , a series of ski jumping world cup events that starts this weekend in oberstdorf , a town in the bavarian alps . ski jumping athletes tend to have brilliant , short-lived careers , and when athletes win one season and lose every tournament thereafter , it makes it difficult for the sport to sustain its fan base . the finn toni nieminen was at one time a ski jump hot shot .
in 1992 , at the age of 16 , he won the four hills tournament , olympic gold and the ski jumping world cup . " you just jumped and lived .
in between , you felt pulled like a sheep on a rope , " nieminen said . after his winning year , nieminen did n't win a single tournament for the rest of his career . many other ski jumpers have similar experiences to nieminen 's .
they have a short , golden period and then burn out .
martin schmitt and sven hannawald are two good examples of this rapid fall from grace .
at the turn of the millennium , they regularly placed in the top 10 at ski jumping competitions .
schmitt was nicknamed the " ski eagle . " falling stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni nieminen from finland won big before not winning at all hannawald 's sweep of the individual four hills tournament titles in 2002 marked the high point for the ski jumping boom in germany .
two years later , hannawald revealed he suffered from burnout and entered psychiatric treatment .
a year later , he announced he was ending his ski jumping career . schmitt , the wildly popular 1999 and 2000 world cup winner , spent four years waiting for another victory . " the winning times are over , " said ski jumping national trainer peter rohwein .
it 's unrealistic to expect someone from the german team to win the tournament , he said . the austrian andreas goldberger also could not match the success of his younger days .
from 1992 to 1996 he dominated the ski jumping world and won the world cup three times .
in the next decade , he could n't win a single competition . " ski jumping is an unfathomably technical sport where unbelievably small things affect performance , " nieminen , the finnish jumper , said .
" that makes washing out an occupational disease .
only one little thing needs to go wrong and you find yourself stuck in a very difficult situation . " jumpers lose their rhythm and most find it nearly impossible to regain it . dwindling interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german sven hannawald was enormously popular before he burned out in germany , as the popular ski jumping stars crashed and burned , spectators lost interest .
in 2001 , 9.57 million people watched the final of the four hills tournament .
in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen . " the negotiation situation has fundamentally changed , and it 's also connected to the sport 's performance , " bolhöfer said . less money means fewer resources for training and youth coaching , which can create a vicious circle .
as the success of ski jumping in germany is on the line , pressure on athletes increases . since the " ski eagle " stopped jumping , the internet site skispringen.com , dedicated to the sport , has noticed a huge drop in the number of hits from germany , said peter siegel .
it reached a low point at the beginning of 2006 and has begun to go back up , he said . " if a german finishes in the top ten , that would be a success .
one can also hope that martin schmitt 's performance will finally increase . " nieminen is philosophical about his short-lived success . " the year i had was one that few athletes experience , " nieminen said .
" you have to be content and feel lucky to have experienced that .
despite everything , it 's only a sport .
it 's not everything in life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 29.12.2006 social democrat leader warns against too many reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just beck , several germans too have protested against various new reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more . social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck appears bent on hitting the emergency brakes on plans for more sweeping changes in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck says enough is enough cuts in unemployment and welfare payments , a controversial health reform and higher sales taxes , he told the german daily newspaper die welt , had sorely tested the endurance levels of the population .
especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs . " we are not seeking to slow down the pace of reforms , " kahrs said .
" all we are aiming for are well-crafted reforms that people can understand and accept .
after all it ’ s the conservatives who are currently trying to block necessary changes . " problems on the right a senior member of the christian democrat ’ s sister party in bavaria , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , announced on thursday that the party would reject a health reform bill in the upper house of parliament representing germany ’ s 16 federal states , the bundesrat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health care reform plan is under threat the csu argues the proposals would jeopardize private health insurance companies which mainly insure affluent germans . so far conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democrat vice-chancellor franz müntefering have opted to stay out of the health-reform debate . apparently they are seeking to press ahead with a plan that foresees both implementing existing reforms and tackling new ones .
the two are said to be on the same wavelength on most issues .
but the going will be getting tougher for them as a minefield of special interests start letting their wishes known . uwe hessler -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in christmas address , german president urges more reform german president horst köhler has used his traditional christmas address to again set out his case for enacting far-reaching reforms in europe 's biggest economy .

especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .

" those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.12.2006 euro rises to new high but europeans remain skeptical großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the euro 's strength , europeans are n't entirely convinced of the currency 's merits for the first time , the euro surpassed the us dollar in terms of the number of banknotes in circulation .
despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive . according to the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , the euro recently surpassed the dollar in terms of the amount of bills in circulation worldwide . during the christmas holidays , the ecb reported a record number of 628 billion euros in banknotes in circulation .
that compares with $ 760 billion -lrb- 585 billion euros -rrb- . " for the first time the euro overtook the dollar related to value , " a european central bank spokesman told the süddeutsche zeitung . " teuro " instead of euro ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans feel groceries are now more expensive despite the euro 's new-found muscle as it nears its fifth anniversary on jan 1 , many europeans from the 12-member eurozone remain deeply skeptical about their common currency . seen as an important step toward deeper european integration , the vast initiative was sold to citizens on its economic merits , promising higher growth and protection from the currency crises that had regularly hit the continent . but public support for the single currency has fallen since its launch in cash form on january 1 , 2002 , when 304 million europeans swapped their national currencies for a common means of exchange . many feel that since its introduction in 2002 , coffee , beer , gasoline and many other basics have become more expensive .
in germany , the currency was quickly nicknamed the " teuro , " a play on the german word " teuer " which means expensive . it 's a regular gripe in germany , for example , that café owners have simply substituted deutschemark prices for euros , effectively doubling the cost of a coffee or beer . the belief can have serious economic consequences .
sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .
in the past decade , the average perceived inflation in germany was " approximately four times higher than the official inflation rate , " the afp news service reported . perception is everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is widely perceived to have raised prices " if the german economy has any interest in sustainably reviving consumption , it should work towards significantly lowering the perception of inflation among consumers , " brachinger said . brachinger 's methods and conclusions have been fiercely contested by bundesbank economists .
but there 's no denying that a gap between real and felt inflation exists . just before the changeover to the euro , fruits , vegetables and petrol increased substantially in price .
consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .
however the european central bank has recently become a target for criticism itself , particularly from french politicians , amid a debate about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen . euro falters on the political front on the political front , the euro was once seen as being a catalyst for deeper integration , but the process of bringing member states into a closer political union has foundered in recent times . although the european union has expanded since its introduction , welcoming 10 new members in 2004 , the rejection of the european constitution by french and dutch voters in 2005 was a setback for the eu project .
there are also signs that the allure of the euro has fallen for candidate countries . slovenia is set to become the 13th member of the eurozone on january 1 , but other new eu members are now showing less enthusiasm than before for jettisoning their national currencies . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .

' grotesque blackmail ' currently , belarus pays gazprom $ 46.68 -lrb- 35 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic metres - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic metres in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . gazprom says it will end supplies to belarus at early new year 's day , if the ex-soviet republic fails to agree to the price hike . belarus , which lies sandwiched between russia and the european union , threatens to retaliate by refusing to allow transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies in germany , lithuania and poland .

the commission will also unveil its strategic energy review on january 10 aimed at providing a vision for the eu 's policies and a step-by-step map on how to achieve it . the bloc also wants to start negotiating a new partnership agreement with russia , more politically assertive recently under president vladimir putin , and make energy a central plank of it . " our energy needs may well limit our ability to push wider foreign policy objectives , not least in the area of conflict resolution , human rights and good governance , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana warned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 29.12.2006 social democrat leader warns against too many reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just beck , several germans too have protested against various new reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more . social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- leader kurt beck appears bent on hitting the emergency brakes on plans for more sweeping changes in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck says enough is enough cuts in unemployment and welfare payments , a controversial health reform and higher sales taxes , he told the german daily newspaper die welt , had sorely tested the endurance levels of the population .
especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs . " we are not seeking to slow down the pace of reforms , " kahrs said .
" all we are aiming for are well-crafted reforms that people can understand and accept .
after all it ’ s the conservatives who are currently trying to block necessary changes . " problems on the right a senior member of the christian democrat ’ s sister party in bavaria , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , announced on thursday that the party would reject a health reform bill in the upper house of parliament representing germany ’ s 16 federal states , the bundesrat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health care reform plan is under threat the csu argues the proposals would jeopardize private health insurance companies which mainly insure affluent germans . so far conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democrat vice-chancellor franz müntefering have opted to stay out of the health-reform debate . apparently they are seeking to press ahead with a plan that foresees both implementing existing reforms and tackling new ones .
the two are said to be on the same wavelength on most issues .
but the going will be getting tougher for them as a minefield of special interests start letting their wishes known . uwe hessler -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in christmas address , german president urges more reform german president horst köhler has used his traditional christmas address to again set out his case for enacting far-reaching reforms in europe 's biggest economy .

especially the cutbacks to long-cherished social benefits , he said , have made the weakest in society suffer the most . but beck ’ s " enough-is-enough " rhetoric has angered both chancellor angela merkel and her conservatives , who claim much remains to be done to make germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century , as well as business leaders . merkel says reform drive must continue " we have to continue with structural reforms , both on the european as well as national level , if we want to stay internationally competitive , " merkel wrote in a guest editorial in german business daily handelsblatt . " that 's why work on necessary reform projects in germany will continue unabated next year , " she said , adding that " the biggest work still lies ahead of us . " " i ’ m astonished by his -lrb- beck 's -rrb- remarks , " said ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel ’ s christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" even more so as this government has only been in office for one year and there are three more years ahead of us .
it ’ s not the time to just sit back and stop the crucial reform process . " business leaders were more scathing in their criticism of beck 's comments . " those who describe reform policies as an unreasonable demand on citizens have n't understood what this is all about .
namely that it 's about preparing our country for the future for the benefit of its citizens , " dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- told newspaper die welt .
" keeping this goal in mind , we 're still at the beginning , not in any way at the end , of the necessary reform process . " dirk martin , chairman of the federal association of young entrepreneurs -lrb- bju -rrb- said beck 's comments sent a totally wrong signal . " those who hit the emergency brake now , are doing a disservice to the future of our country , " martin said . sagging popularity observers believe beck 's blowing the whistle on reforms is due to the government 's slumping popularity ratings .
his social democrats , they say , have been unable to portray themselves as the champions of social justice in the conservative-led government .
the result has been that many of the spd 's traditional working-class voters continue to shun the party . with the spd still trailing merkel 's cdu in the polls , beck 's statements are also seen as an early electioneering stunt in the party 's campaign for regional elections over the next two years and for kurt beck ’ s own bid for the chancellorship in general elections in 2009 . the allegations are however denied by senior social democrats such as johannes kahrs . " we are not seeking to slow down the pace of reforms , " kahrs said .
" all we are aiming for are well-crafted reforms that people can understand and accept .
after all it ’ s the conservatives who are currently trying to block necessary changes . " problems on the right a senior member of the christian democrat ’ s sister party in bavaria , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , announced on thursday that the party would reject a health reform bill in the upper house of parliament representing germany ’ s 16 federal states , the bundesrat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health care reform plan is under threat the csu argues the proposals would jeopardize private health insurance companies which mainly insure affluent germans . so far conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democrat vice-chancellor franz müntefering have opted to stay out of the health-reform debate . apparently they are seeking to press ahead with a plan that foresees both implementing existing reforms and tackling new ones .
the two are said to be on the same wavelength on most issues .
but the going will be getting tougher for them as a minefield of special interests start letting their wishes known . uwe hessler -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in christmas address , german president urges more reform german president horst köhler has used his traditional christmas address to again set out his case for enacting far-reaching reforms in europe 's biggest economy .

andreas troge , president of the agency , said that could reduce the production of climate-damaging exhaust emissions by up to 30 percent . limited support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slowing traffic could help the environment the speed limit proposal seems to have support from politicians in both parties of the ruling coalition government , a german newspaper reported . " i would argue that a speed limit makes sense on the basis of climate protection , " the social democratic party 's transport politician heidi wright told the berliner zeitung . the european union recently dismissed germany 's plan for cutting co2 emissions as extremely inadequate .
that has left the government in the position of proposing a more ambitious plan that will also keep utility companies happy . german utilities have warned that a more ambitious plan would risk jobs and the current economic upswing .
but not everyone is convinced slowing down drivers is the best way for germany to cut emissions . stop speeding on the autobahn ?
no way # b # and politically , it wo n't be easy for the government to curb germany 's speed demons .
driving fast on the autobahn is considered a sacred right by many . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , as well as the major automobile clubs , have spoken out against a general speed limit .
tiefensee pointed out that 40 percent of the autobahn already has speed limits .
he feels its better to push for innovations in fuels and engines . peter meyer , head of the powerful german automobile association adac called the speed limit idea a foolish , outdated proposal in the tabloid bild zeitung . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

sluggish consumer spending can put brakes on a country 's overall economic performance , as happened in germany for many years . swiss economist hans wolfgang brachinger developed a special price index of perceived inflation .

consumers wrongly blamed the euro , cologne-based market research group ifav has suggested .
that caused prices in cafes and restaurants to increase , further fueling the belief that the euro was to blame for higher goods . the european central bank has tried to rebut claims of higher prices and the frankfurt-based institution points to the stable level of inflation , which has remained at slightly more than 2.0 percent over the period . the bank has been at pains to stress that increases in the costs of energy and real estate are not connected to the euro and that prices for some goods have actually fallen , in the high-tech sector for example .

in 2005 , the tournament had only 5.48 million viewers .
the market share for ski jumping coverage at the private television channel rtl dropped almost 20 points to 28 percent . " that 's still a very good rating , " said rtl spokesman matthias bolhöfer . it 's questionable whether rtl continues to make a profit on the event with advertising , since the station pays approximately 14 million euros each year to the german ski association for broadcasting rights .
the contract runs out after the current season and it 's unclear what will happen .

andreas troge , president of the agency , said that could reduce the production of climate-damaging exhaust emissions by up to 30 percent . limited support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slowing traffic could help the environment the speed limit proposal seems to have support from politicians in both parties of the ruling coalition government , a german newspaper reported . " i would argue that a speed limit makes sense on the basis of climate protection , " the social democratic party 's transport politician heidi wright told the berliner zeitung . the european union recently dismissed germany 's plan for cutting co2 emissions as extremely inadequate .
that has left the government in the position of proposing a more ambitious plan that will also keep utility companies happy . german utilities have warned that a more ambitious plan would risk jobs and the current economic upswing .
but not everyone is convinced slowing down drivers is the best way for germany to cut emissions . stop speeding on the autobahn ?
no way # b # and politically , it wo n't be easy for the government to curb germany 's speed demons .
driving fast on the autobahn is considered a sacred right by many . german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , as well as the major automobile clubs , have spoken out against a general speed limit .
tiefensee pointed out that 40 percent of the autobahn already has speed limits .
he feels its better to push for innovations in fuels and engines . peter meyer , head of the powerful german automobile association adac called the speed limit idea a foolish , outdated proposal in the tabloid bild zeitung . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .
-lrb- 19.12.2006 -rrb- germany says eu 's emissions requirements are unreasonable just before germany assumes both the eu and g8 presidencies , the european commission has said berlin is n't doing enough to reduce co2 emissions , although germany has declared climate policy a top priority .

google google has been eyeing up new friends this year google has become the web 's equivalent of mcdonalds - a brand that has become embedded in our language and seems to be everywhere .
it has had another busy year , adding yet more services to its ever-widening portfolio , setting the rumour mill buzzing with talk of take-overs and alliances and , of course , the much talked about rivalry with microsoft .
at the beginning of the year it tottered on its pedestal for a while , with the announcement that it would be offering a censored version of its search engine in china .
there was dismay among google fans who felt it was being hypocritical to its motto of " do no evil " , while others lauded its attempts to face the chinese authorities head on and inform users when their searches were being censored .
scattergun approach on the product front , it was as busy as ever and 2006 saw the launch of , among others , google calendar , an online payments system , and a news archive .
nate elliott , senior analyst at jupiter research , is not convinced that its constant release of new products is the best way forward .
" it has what i term a scattergun approach to product launches .
it seems to launch whatever it feels like launching but it has yet to have a commercial hit .
in fact the one hit in their history has been search .
mr elliott feels a " more directed product strategy " should be top of google 's priorities for 2007 but in terms of what it will offer , he is not prepared to speculate .
" they surprise us so regularly i would n't attempt to guess but expect more creativity , " he said .
perhaps the most exciting development in the googlesphere this year was unrelated to products .
a deal with myspace in the summer saw the search engine paying the social networking site $ 900m for the right to provide it with search and adverts .
this was followed by its buy-out of youtube later in the year , signalling how seriously it was taking the whole area of user-generated content .
the media furore that followed saw talk of it fuelling a second internet bubble .
the buy-out helped its shares climb to an all-time high of $ 500 by the end of the year .
yahoo yahoo has been criticised for its involvement in china few of the stories written about web giant yahoo this year have failed to mention in some way or another that it is " struggling to compete with google " .
this struggle has been reflected in falling share prices .
john delaney , an analyst at research firm ovum , believes that the headline battle between yahoo and google belies yahoo 's stature as an internet veteran .
" it is important not to underestimate yahoo .
it has a well established group of users who , unlike google , are willing to pay for its services .
also unlike google , it is not so heavily dependent on a single service , " he told the bbc news website .
to counter the decline in its fortunes , yahoo 's homepage had a major make-over in may and at the end of the year the company undertook a big restructuring process .
despite criticisms that yahoo has been slow to innovate compared to google , the search giant has launched a number of new services including yahoo go at the beginning of the year which saw it move from its traditional home on the desktop to mobile devices .
tie-up with microsoft like google , yahoo has been sniffing around for a social networking friend but rumours in september that it was on the verge of buying facebook - a website that allows university friends to stay in touch - have not resulted in anything concrete as yet .
it did make some other friends though and notable tie-ups this year included a deal with ebay , which gave yahoo the right to use paypal for yahoo services and a deal with microsoft that allowed users of the rival instant messaging system to finally talk to each other .
for mr delaney , this tie-up was the single most important part of yahoo 's 2006 calendar .
" it could see figures for instant messaging increase rapidly , " he said .
instant messaging , unlike google 's core asset of search , is an innately sticky service , explained mr delaney .
" with search it is very easy for a user to switch if a better service comes along .
this is more difficult with instant messaging because you leave behind buddy lists , need a new address , etc , " he said .
while many companies ' involvements in china have been questioned this year , the lions share of the criticism has fallen on yahoo .

yahoo yahoo has been criticised for its involvement in china few of the stories written about web giant yahoo this year have failed to mention in some way or another that it is " struggling to compete with google " .
this struggle has been reflected in falling share prices .

" it is important not to underestimate yahoo .
it has a well established group of users who , unlike google , are willing to pay for its services .
also unlike google , it is not so heavily dependent on a single service , " he told the bbc news website .
to counter the decline in its fortunes , yahoo 's homepage had a major make-over in may and at the end of the year the company undertook a big restructuring process .
despite criticisms that yahoo has been slow to innovate compared to google , the search giant has launched a number of new services including yahoo go at the beginning of the year which saw it move from its traditional home on the desktop to mobile devices .
tie-up with microsoft like google , yahoo has been sniffing around for a social networking friend but rumours in september that it was on the verge of buying facebook - a website that allows university friends to stay in touch - have not resulted in anything concrete as yet .
it did make some other friends though and notable tie-ups this year included a deal with ebay , which gave yahoo the right to use paypal for yahoo services and a deal with microsoft that allowed users of the rival instant messaging system to finally talk to each other .
for mr delaney , this tie-up was the single most important part of yahoo 's 2006 calendar .
" it could see figures for instant messaging increase rapidly , " he said .
instant messaging , unlike google 's core asset of search , is an innately sticky service , explained mr delaney .
" with search it is very easy for a user to switch if a better service comes along .

an expert group , set up by the scottish executive , said there should be a " more pragmatic " approach to nutrition to entice pupils back to school meals .
its proposals build on the hungry for success project , which ends this month .
the initiative aimed to get pupils to kick junk food .
however , many schools saw a drop in school meal uptake .
cathy higginson , chair of the expert working group , which recently presented its finding to the scottish parliament 's communities committee , said it had drawn on the experience of hungry for success and new guidelines in england .
the group recommended a target for providing 30 % of pupil 's daily nutrients within the school lunch , compared to an english target of 40 % .
" we think this is too restrictive on caterers to provide meals that young people actually want to eat , " she said .
" they have to artificially boost micronutrients in meals by adding dried fruit for example . "
the group has also proposed a reduction in targets for the amount of salt in food . "
if some crisp products are allowed in school the hope is that pupils will eat these rather than going outside and buying unhealthy products " cathy higginson chair of the expert working group on nutritional standards ms higginson said : " we should not split hairs on the details and be over demanding in respect to some of the nutritional requirements if that 's going to put young people off .
" it 's very important to keep pupils in school and make the meals tasty and attractive and appealing . "
schools would also be allowed to serve fried foods three times a week , instead of the current two times , under the proposals .
this means schools would be able to retain the popular tradition of fish and chips on a friday and also include chips , as part of a meal , on the menu on one other day .
ms higginson said the new standards aimed to allow some fried foods as part of a balanced diet , while ending the " culture of chips and curry sauce and chips with cheese as meal " .
the group also took a more lenient view towards savoury snacks outwith school lunches , recommending crisps that meet tough nutrient standards should be made available .
industry innovation ms higginson said : " there 's a very limited amount of these products available at the moment , but this could create a window of opportunity for innovation within the food industry to develop crisps that schools could sell .
" and if some crisp products are allowed in school the hope is that pupils will eat these rather than going outside and buying unhealthy products . "
the group 's report also proposed that artificially-sweetened drinks should be allowed in schools in the short-term to help schools phase out fizzy drinks and allow for pupils ' tastes to adapt .
holyrood 's communities committee is currently considering the schools -lrb- health promotion and nutrition -rrb- -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill , which aims to set nutritional standards for food and drink in schools .
the scottish executive is expected to respond to the expert group 's recommendations early in 2007 .
ms higginson said it was outwith the scope of the bill to address the issue of pupils buying unhealthy lunches from chip vans and convenient stores , though she pointed to pockets of good practice .
" fife council has introduced vans that sell healthy food in direct competition with chip vans , " she said .
" according to anecdotal evidence , many young people go outside school just because they have the desire to get out at lunchtime and not necessarily because of the food that 's available in school .
" so going into competition with chip vans is a very clever strategy . "
she added that the scottish executive was also working with the scottish grocers ' federation to improve the healthy options available within convenient stores , including healthy meal deals .

an expert group , set up by the scottish executive , said there should be a " more pragmatic " approach to nutrition to entice pupils back to school meals .
its proposals build on the hungry for success project , which ends this month .
the initiative aimed to get pupils to kick junk food .
however , many schools saw a drop in school meal uptake .
cathy higginson , chair of the expert working group , which recently presented its finding to the scottish parliament 's communities committee , said it had drawn on the experience of hungry for success and new guidelines in england .
the group recommended a target for providing 30 % of pupil 's daily nutrients within the school lunch , compared to an english target of 40 % .
" we think this is too restrictive on caterers to provide meals that young people actually want to eat , " she said .
" they have to artificially boost micronutrients in meals by adding dried fruit for example . "
the group has also proposed a reduction in targets for the amount of salt in food .
if some crisp products are allowed in school the hope is that pupils will eat these rather than going outside and buying unhealthy products cathy higginson chair of the expert working group on nutritional standards ms higginson said : " we should not split hairs on the details and be over demanding in respect to some of the nutritional requirements if that 's going to put young people off .
" it 's very important to keep pupils in school and make the meals tasty and attractive and appealing . "
schools would also be allowed to serve fried foods three times a week , instead of the current two times , under the proposals .
this means schools would be able to retain the popular tradition of fish and chips on a friday and also include chips , as part of a meal , on the menu on one other day .
ms higginson said the new standards aimed to allow some fried foods as part of a balanced diet , while ending the " culture of chips and curry sauce and chips with cheese as meal " .
the group also took a more lenient view towards savoury snacks outwith school lunches , recommending crisps that meet tough nutrient standards should be made available .
industry innovation ms higginson said : " there 's a very limited amount of these products available at the moment , but this could create a window of opportunity for innovation within the food industry to develop crisps that schools could sell .
" and if some crisp products are allowed in school the hope is that pupils will eat these rather than going outside and buying unhealthy products . "
the group 's report also proposed that artificially-sweetened drinks should be allowed in schools in the short-term to help schools phase out fizzy drinks and allow for pupils ' tastes to adapt .
holyrood 's communities committee is currently considering the schools -lrb- health promotion and nutrition -rrb- -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill , which aims to set nutritional standards for food and drink in schools .
one local council has gone into competition with chip vans the scottish executive is expected to respond to the expert group 's recommendations early in 2007 .
ms higginson said it was outwith the scope of the bill to address the issue of pupils buying unhealthy lunches from chip vans and convenient stores , though she pointed to pockets of good practice .
" fife council has introduced vans that sell healthy food in direct competition with chip vans , " she said .
" according to anecdotal evidence , many young people go outside school just because they have the desire to get out at lunchtime and not necessarily because of the food that 's available in school .
" so going into competition with chip vans is a very clever strategy . "
she added that the scottish executive was also working with the scottish grocers ' federation to improve the healthy options available within convenient stores , including healthy meal deals .

teachers in wales and england have since 2005 had 10 % of the timetable out of the classroom to plan lessons .
nut cymru claims this has seen some classes taught by unqualified staff .
the education department said reforms allowed teachers to focus on teaching .
the assembly government said assistants were not substitutes for teachers .
the changes were introduced as part of the uk government 's workload agreement which has been rolled out over several years and was intended to cut areas such as administration from teachers ' workloads .
but teaching union nut cymru claims that since the agreement was implemented , some classes have been taught by unqualified staff .
nut cymru secretary david evans said he believed it was happening in an increasing number of schools .
mr evans added that as a result of the changes , qualified supply teachers were also finding it difficult to get work .
he said : " some secondary schools use teacher agencies rather than their local authorities when they require cover .
" we have members , in their later 40s and early 50s , who left teaching to bring up a family or to care for an elderly parent .
they later wish to return to the profession via supply teaching .
" until recently , they would have been taken on fairly regularly by three or four comprehensive or primary schools .
" increasingly , however , we find that they have had only a handful of supply days and those , possibly , at only one school .
" many supply teachers feel strongly that the new pay and staffing structures together with the use of agency teachers have left them with no in-service training , no pension provision and , to all extent and purposes , with no job . "
' benefit pupils ' the uk department for education and skills said the school reforms were benefiting teachers .
a spokesman said : " our workforce reforms are turning the tide on teacher workload and ensuring that teachers can focus on what they do best - teach .
" they remove a whole range of administrative tasks from teachers , give them 10 % of the timetable to plan , prepare and assess work outside of the classroom and limit the amount of time they can be asked to cover for absent colleagues , all helping to benefit pupils .
" we also have more teachers than at anytime since 1980 as well as record numbers of support staff .
" we continue to work with an expert panel of heads to slash the bureaucratic burden on schools and ensure that any policy changes consider the workload impact on teachers . "
' not interchangeable ' a welsh assembly government spokesperson explained that the workload agreement was an issue of pay and conditions and was not devolved to the assembly .
but the spokesperson added : " teachers and support staff are not interchangeable .
" responsibility for pupils ' overall learning outcomes will always rest with qualified teachers .
" support staff will only work with pupils if they are suitably qualified and experienced and under the direction and supervision of a qualified teacher .
" it will always be the responsibility of schools to ensure that the level and mix of staff employed are sufficient to meet pupils ' needs .
" schools must not use teaching assistants as substitutes for teachers as this would be in breach of the national workload agreement . "

teachers in wales and england have since 2005 had 10 % of the timetable out of the classroom to plan lessons .
nut cymru claims this has seen some classes taught by unqualified staff .
the education department said reforms allowed teachers to focus on teaching .
the assembly government said assistants were not substitutes for teachers .
the changes were introduced as part of the uk government 's workload agreement which has been rolled out over several years and was intended to cut areas such as administration from teachers ' workloads .
but teaching union nut cymru claims that since the agreement was implemented , some classes have been taught by unqualified staff .
nut cymru secretary david evans said he believed it was happening in an increasing number of schools .
mr evans added that as a result of the changes , qualified supply teachers were also finding it difficult to get work .
it is claimed some classes are being taught by support staff he said : " some secondary schools use teacher agencies rather than their local authorities when they require cover .
" we have members , in their later 40s and early 50s , who left teaching to bring up a family or to care for an elderly parent .
they later wish to return to the profession via supply teaching .
" until recently , they would have been taken on fairly regularly by three or four comprehensive or primary schools .
" increasingly , however , we find that they have had only a handful of supply days and those , possibly , at only one school .
" many supply teachers feel strongly that the new pay and staffing structures together with the use of agency teachers have left them with no in-service training , no pension provision and , to all extent and purposes , with no job . "
' benefit pupils ' the uk department for education and skills said the school reforms were benefiting teachers .
a spokesman said : " our workforce reforms are turning the tide on teacher workload and ensuring that teachers can focus on what they do best - teach .
" they remove a whole range of administrative tasks from teachers , give them 10 % of the timetable to plan , prepare and assess work outside of the classroom and limit the amount of time they can be asked to cover for absent colleagues , all helping to benefit pupils .
" we also have more teachers than at anytime since 1980 as well as record numbers of support staff .
" we continue to work with an expert panel of heads to slash the bureaucratic burden on schools and ensure that any policy changes consider the workload impact on teachers . "
' not interchangeable ' a welsh assembly government spokesperson explained that the workload agreement was an issue of pay and conditions and was not devolved to the assembly .
but the spokesperson added : " teachers and support staff are not interchangeable .
" responsibility for pupils ' overall learning outcomes will always rest with qualified teachers .
" support staff will only work with pupils if they are suitably qualified and experienced and under the direction and supervision of a qualified teacher .
" it will always be the responsibility of schools to ensure that the level and mix of staff employed are sufficient to meet pupils ' needs .
" schools must not use teaching assistants as substitutes for teachers as this would be in breach of the national workload agreement . "

the 34-year-old is gearing up to present the bbc 's new year live show for the third year running .
here , she reveals her new year resolutions and describes a live television interview which made her blush .
why have you decided to present new year live again for the third year ?
this is the third year natasha has presented new year live it 's the most extraordinary party down at somerset house and this year it 's bigger and better than ever with more huge acts and some fantastic names .
the firework display is truly breathtaking and it 's just an amazing way to see in a new year .
the whole atmosphere is just so exciting .
who else will be there ?
jamelia is performing for us this year .
we 've also got connie fisher and the children from the sound of music performing .
sophie ellis bextor and the feeling will be there and nick knowles is going to be down with the crowds on the embankment .
also bbc weather forecaster carol kirkwood and breakfast 's sports presenter chris hollins have been learning how to ice skate with team gb .
they 're putting on a performance to raise money for children in need .
do you still get nervous doing live television ?
there 's something about live television that adds a real edge to your performance .
i do n't actually get nervous any more , but i get nervous when things go wrong .
then you have n't actually got time to get nervous , you just have to deal with it .
what are your new year resolutions ?
natasha became six o 'clock news co-presenter in october 2005 the usual - drink more water , stop eating so much chocolate , go to the gym .
i want to read more books , i always get caught up reading newspapers and magazines for information rather than enjoyment - i want to enjoy reading some more .
what have been the highs and lows of 2006 for you ?
i am thrilled to bits to still be doing the six o 'clock news and to incorporate that with things like children in need and the royal variety show .
i 've also just been filming who do you think you are ?
that has been a massive insight into my family life , and that , i suppose , was both a professional and a personal high .
lows ?
i do n't know about that , i 'll have to get back to you .
can you think of an embarrassing moment which has happened to you on air ?
it was probably the lowest moment of my interviewing career .
breakfast had the bright idea of interviewing my dad as he had been in kenya when al-qaeda threatened british airways and flights had temporarily been cancelled from there .
natasha was crowned the first winner of strictly come dancing before i knew it i was reading an intro which said , ' i am joined now by a very special guest - my father ' .
i essentially stuttered and stumbled my way through that interview , i was absolutely hopeless because i have never started an interview with dad .
i just found it awfully awkward .
i blushed and i could n't get my sentences out .
what was more embarrassing was that for weeks afterwards i had members of the public telling me that my father was extremely sexy , which i found just unbearable .
new year live is on bbc one , sunday at 11.30pm.

the 34-year-old is gearing up to present the bbc 's new year live show for the third year running .
here , she reveals her new year resolutions and describes a live television interview which made her blush .
why have you decided to present new year live again for the third year ?
this is the third year natasha has presented new year live it 's the most extraordinary party down at somerset house and this year it 's bigger and better than ever with more huge acts and some fantastic names .
the firework display is truly breathtaking and it 's just an amazing way to see in a new year .
the whole atmosphere is just so exciting .
who else will be there ?
jamelia is performing for us this year .
we 've also got connie fisher and the children from the sound of music performing .
sophie ellis bextor and the feeling will be there and nick knowles is going to be down with the crowds on the embankment .
also bbc weather forecaster carol kirkwood and breakfast 's sports presenter chris hollins have been learning how to ice skate with team gb .
they 're putting on a performance to raise money for children in need .
do you still get nervous doing live television ?
there 's something about live television that adds a real edge to your performance .
i do n't actually get nervous any more , but i get nervous when things go wrong .
then you have n't actually got time to get nervous , you just have to deal with it .
what are your new year resolutions ?
natasha became six o 'clock news co-presenter in october 2005 the usual - drink more water , stop eating so much chocolate , go to the gym .
i want to read more books , i always get caught up reading newspapers and magazines for information rather than enjoyment - i want to enjoy reading some more .
what have been the highs and lows of 2006 for you ?
i am thrilled to bits to still be doing the six o 'clock news and to incorporate that with things like children in need and the royal variety show .
i 've also just been filming who do you think you are ?
that has been a massive insight into my family life , and that , i suppose , was both a professional and a personal high .
lows ?
i do n't know about that , i 'll have to get back to you .
can you think of an embarrassing moment which has happened to you on air ?
it was probably the lowest moment of my interviewing career .
breakfast had the bright idea of interviewing my dad as he had been in kenya when al-qaeda threatened british airways and flights had temporarily been cancelled from there .
natasha was crowned the first winner of strictly come dancing before i knew it i was reading an intro which said , ' i am joined now by a very special guest - my father ' .
i essentially stuttered and stumbled my way through that interview , i was absolutely hopeless because i have never started an interview with dad .
i just found it awfully awkward .
i blushed and i could n't get my sentences out .
what was more embarrassing was that for weeks afterwards i had members of the public telling me that my father was extremely sexy , which i found just unbearable .

"
anyone who has been online for some years , as i have been , should have felt very smug this year as the internet and all its associated technologies , services , protocols and applications went mainstream .
the change was clear in the media , where stories about web 2.0 startups , google 's machinations , the imminent consumer launch of vista and the importance of wikipedia made the main news pages of the papers , featured in magazines and were covered extensively on radio and television .
instead of being consigned to the cul-de-sac of the technology supplement or programme , or covered grudgingly as business news , these stories were part of the news agenda , to be covered along with crime , scandal , politics and heartwarming stories of everyday people .
and the coverage itself was not just about the money being made , as it was the last time network matters dominated the news agenda just before the dotcom crash in 2000 , but about the technology , the social networks and the impact on our daily life .
hi-tech life yet despite the interest , and even though the numbers of people online in the developed world continued to grow rapidly , the actual technologies themselves were not very innovative or exciting .
networks got faster , processors speeded up in line with moore 's law , and a significant number of people now have a terabyte - a thousand gigabytes - of storage capacity in their homes .
we spent more time online , and did more online , but the sorts of things we are doing were not really that different from what was on offer in 2005 , or even 2004 .
e-mail , photos , file sharing , online communities and even virtual worlds are nothing new . "
if we can succeed in getting wireless laptops into the hands of hundreds of millions of children outside the developed world then we will have bridged the digital divide . "
bill thompson of course this is not surprising .
there is little truly innovative in computing and even the web itself was little more than an effective way to do hypertext , reinventing something that had been around for at least 20 years before tim berners-lee picked it up .
the real innovation this year has been in the ways we use the technologies , in their availability and ease of use , and in the manner in which the services and applications are embedded in all aspects of daily life , whether at home or work .
we are building our lives around the network and the things it makes possible , and 2006 marks the year in which this became a sensible and indeed rather normal thing to do rather than something that marked you out as a geek or a leading edge afficionado of the new .
laptop life in the next year we 're going to see smartphones and mobile access finally come into their own , as the devices live up to the earlier promise and the networks finally realise that treating handsets as network nodes makes a lot more sense than acting like they are mobile phones with added data services .
the single coolest thing i saw last year was a demonstration of slingbox on a symbian smartphone , watching a tv signal from california , sent over the internet and controlled from the handset .
of course it is really just a clever bit of integration , however disruptive it will prove to be to the television industry .
but in the longer term , when we can put 2006 in a broader perspective , there will be one project that stands out above all others .
it will not be second life , which will soon be a historical footnote in the development of virtual environments .
nor will myspace or flickr or wikipedia appear as anything other than small steps on the path to the networked world , however large they may seem to us today .
the really significant change this year was the successful development of the children 's machine , which started life as the ' $ 100 laptop ' , a project to create a low-cost computer that governments can give to children around the world .
i saw the prototype at the world summit on the information society in tunisia in november 2005 , and in less than a year the one laptop per child team behind the project have managed to solve the major design challenges and reach the point where physical computers are being manufactured in china .
these are only test machines , and more work is needed , but the plan is to start full production in spring 2007 .
this is an astonishing achievement , and a lot of the credit has to go to olpc 's chief technology officer , mary lou jepsen .
she has pushed through innovations in screen design , energy consumption and the user interface to give us a computer that will transform the relationship of the world 's poorest children to a networked economy that is currently owned and controlled by the rich nations and their affluent citizens .
the project is often criticised by those who worry about diverting resources into laptops and away from other development goals , or who fear that the computers are not a good educational tool , or that corrupt governments or greedy parents will keep the machines away from the kids .
these concerns are valid , and we need to do everything possible to make sure that they are not realised , but they should not detract from the majestic vision which drives the project .
if we can succeed in getting wireless laptops into the hands of hundreds of millions of children outside the developed world then we will have bridged the digital divide and opened up the network to the poor , the disadvantaged and the exploited .
they will want things from it that we can not yet imagine , and they will finally be in a position to shape the world for themselves instead of relying on what we are willing to offer them .
that , surely , is worth taking risks for ? "

of course it is really just a clever bit of integration , however disruptive it will prove to be to the television industry .
but in the longer term , when we can put 2006 in a broader perspective , there will be one project that stands out above all others .
bill was less than impressed with second life it will not be second life , which will soon be a historical footnote in the development of virtual environments .
nor will myspace or flickr or wikipedia appear as anything other than small steps on the path to the networked world , however large they may seem to us today .
the really significant change this year was the successful development of the children 's machine , which started life as the ' $ 100 laptop ' , a project to create a low-cost computer that governments can give to children around the world .
i saw the prototype at the world summit on the information society in tunisia in november 2005 , and in less than a year the one laptop per child team behind the project have managed to solve the major design challenges and reach the point where physical computers are being manufactured in china .
these are only test machines , and more work is needed , but the plan is to start full production in spring 2007 .
this is an astonishing achievement , and a lot of the credit has to go to olpc 's chief technology officer , mary lou jepsen .
she has pushed through innovations in screen design , energy consumption and the user interface to give us a computer that will transform the relationship of the world 's poorest children to a networked economy that is currently owned and controlled by the rich nations and their affluent citizens .
hypertext had a long history before the world wide web the project is often criticised by those who worry about diverting resources into laptops and away from other development goals , or who fear that the computers are not a good educational tool , or that corrupt governments or greedy parents will keep the machines away from the kids .
these concerns are valid , and we need to do everything possible to make sure that they are not realised , but they should not detract from the majestic vision which drives the project .
if we can succeed in getting wireless laptops into the hands of hundreds of millions of children outside the developed world then we will have bridged the digital divide and opened up the network to the poor , the disadvantaged and the exploited .
they will want things from it that we can not yet imagine , and they will finally be in a position to shape the world for themselves instead of relying on what we are willing to offer them .
that , surely , is worth taking risks for ?

the cheap laptop could be a boon in many nations anyone who has been online for some years , as i have been , should have felt very smug this year as the internet and all its associated technologies , services , protocols and applications went mainstream .
the change was clear in the media , where stories about web 2.0 startups , google 's machinations , the imminent consumer launch of vista and the importance of wikipedia made the main news pages of the papers , featured in magazines and were covered extensively on radio and television .
instead of being consigned to the cul-de-sac of the technology supplement or programme , or covered grudgingly as business news , these stories were part of the news agenda , to be covered along with crime , scandal , politics and heartwarming stories of everyday people .
and the coverage itself was not just about the money being made , as it was the last time network matters dominated the news agenda just before the dotcom crash in 2000 , but about the technology , the social networks and the impact on our daily life .
hi-tech life yet despite the interest , and even though the numbers of people online in the developed world continued to grow rapidly , the actual technologies themselves were not very innovative or exciting .
networks got faster , processors speeded up in line with moore 's law , and a significant number of people now have a terabyte - a thousand gigabytes - of storage capacity in their homes .
we spent more time online , and did more online , but the sorts of things we are doing were not really that different from what was on offer in 2005 , or even 2004 .
e-mail , photos , file sharing , online communities and even virtual worlds are nothing new .
if we can succeed in getting wireless laptops into the hands of hundreds of millions of children outside the developed world then we will have bridged the digital divide .
bill thompson of course this is not surprising .
there is little truly innovative in computing and even the web itself was little more than an effective way to do hypertext , reinventing something that had been around for at least 20 years before tim berners-lee picked it up .
the real innovation this year has been in the ways we use the technologies , in their availability and ease of use , and in the manner in which the services and applications are embedded in all aspects of daily life , whether at home or work .
we are building our lives around the network and the things it makes possible , and 2006 marks the year in which this became a sensible and indeed rather normal thing to do rather than something that marked you out as a geek or a leading edge afficionado of the new .
laptop life in the next year we 're going to see smartphones and mobile access finally come into their own , as the devices live up to the earlier promise and the networks finally realise that treating handsets as network nodes makes a lot more sense than acting like they are mobile phones with added data services .

the cheap laptop could be a boon in many nations anyone who has been online for some years , as i have been , should have felt very smug this year as the internet and all its associated technologies , services , protocols and applications went mainstream .
the change was clear in the media , where stories about web 2.0 startups , google 's machinations , the imminent consumer launch of vista and the importance of wikipedia made the main news pages of the papers , featured in magazines and were covered extensively on radio and television .
instead of being consigned to the cul-de-sac of the technology supplement or programme , or covered grudgingly as business news , these stories were part of the news agenda , to be covered along with crime , scandal , politics and heartwarming stories of everyday people .
and the coverage itself was not just about the money being made , as it was the last time network matters dominated the news agenda just before the dotcom crash in 2000 , but about the technology , the social networks and the impact on our daily life .
hi-tech life yet despite the interest , and even though the numbers of people online in the developed world continued to grow rapidly , the actual technologies themselves were not very innovative or exciting .
networks got faster , processors speeded up in line with moore 's law , and a significant number of people now have a terabyte - a thousand gigabytes - of storage capacity in their homes .
we spent more time online , and did more online , but the sorts of things we are doing were not really that different from what was on offer in 2005 , or even 2004 .
e-mail , photos , file sharing , online communities and even virtual worlds are nothing new .
if we can succeed in getting wireless laptops into the hands of hundreds of millions of children outside the developed world then we will have bridged the digital divide .
bill thompson of course this is not surprising .
there is little truly innovative in computing and even the web itself was little more than an effective way to do hypertext , reinventing something that had been around for at least 20 years before tim berners-lee picked it up .
the real innovation this year has been in the ways we use the technologies , in their availability and ease of use , and in the manner in which the services and applications are embedded in all aspects of daily life , whether at home or work .
we are building our lives around the network and the things it makes possible , and 2006 marks the year in which this became a sensible and indeed rather normal thing to do rather than something that marked you out as a geek or a leading edge afficionado of the new .
laptop life in the next year we 're going to see smartphones and mobile access finally come into their own , as the devices live up to the earlier promise and the networks finally realise that treating handsets as network nodes makes a lot more sense than acting like they are mobile phones with added data services .
the single coolest thing i saw last year was a demonstration of slingbox on a symbian smartphone , watching a tv signal from california , sent over the internet and controlled from the handset .
of course it is really just a clever bit of integration , however disruptive it will prove to be to the television industry .
but in the longer term , when we can put 2006 in a broader perspective , there will be one project that stands out above all others .
bill was less than impressed with second life it will not be second life , which will soon be a historical footnote in the development of virtual environments .
nor will myspace or flickr or wikipedia appear as anything other than small steps on the path to the networked world , however large they may seem to us today .
the really significant change this year was the successful development of the children 's machine , which started life as the ' $ 100 laptop ' , a project to create a low-cost computer that governments can give to children around the world .
i saw the prototype at the world summit on the information society in tunisia in november 2005 , and in less than a year the one laptop per child team behind the project have managed to solve the major design challenges and reach the point where physical computers are being manufactured in china .
these are only test machines , and more work is needed , but the plan is to start full production in spring 2007 .
this is an astonishing achievement , and a lot of the credit has to go to olpc 's chief technology officer , mary lou jepsen .
she has pushed through innovations in screen design , energy consumption and the user interface to give us a computer that will transform the relationship of the world 's poorest children to a networked economy that is currently owned and controlled by the rich nations and their affluent citizens .
hypertext had a long history before the world wide web the project is often criticised by those who worry about diverting resources into laptops and away from other development goals , or who fear that the computers are not a good educational tool , or that corrupt governments or greedy parents will keep the machines away from the kids .
these concerns are valid , and we need to do everything possible to make sure that they are not realised , but they should not detract from the majestic vision which drives the project .
if we can succeed in getting wireless laptops into the hands of hundreds of millions of children outside the developed world then we will have bridged the digital divide and opened up the network to the poor , the disadvantaged and the exploited .
they will want things from it that we can not yet imagine , and they will finally be in a position to shape the world for themselves instead of relying on what we are willing to offer them .
that , surely , is worth taking risks for ?

by william horsley bbc news europe analyst mrs merkel has proven to be a skilful negotiator in the eu chancellor angela merkel has chosen the motto " succeeding together " for germany 's six-month eu presidency starting on 1 january - at a time of weak morale in the eu .
on the plus side , the eu is celebrating the entry of romania and bulgaria as new members , its economy is picking up and it claims global leadership on issues like climate change .
but some european leaders fear the union is close to paralysis .
its flagship economic reforms have largely stalled .
its populations complain of enlargement " fatigue " .
the risk of terrorist attack is said to be as high as ever .
and europe 's vital relationships with america and russia need repairing .
privately , some german officials admit to sleeping badly when they think about the responsibilities they face .
fresh hopes yet there are widespread hopes among eu-watchers that " angela can fix it " .
mrs merkel earned plaudits for her role in mediating a timely agreement on the eu 's long-term budget at a summit a year ago .
now germany , as europe 's largest nation and biggest economy , is being asked to revive the eu 's faltering sense of purpose .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the german presidency expects to spend a lot of energy responding to unforeseen crises on the eu 's behalf .
but he has named three ambitious goals : progress towards a new european constitution or set of decision-making rules , despite the rejection of a constitutional treaty by voters in france and the netherlands beefing up the eu 's common foreign policy , to show that europe can be effective in tackling the world 's most dangerous conflicts finding answers to the looming threat to europe 's energy security , as well as climate change and other long-term challenges .
constitutional confusion sorting out the constitutional confusion looks a forlorn hope , as any new proposals may deepen existing splits among eu nations rather than heal them .
deep divisions persist in the eu over the constitution mrs merkel wants to save as much as possible of the original draft treaty , which provided for an eu president and foreign minister at the head of new structures for common european internal and foreign policies .
at a special leaders ' meeting on 25 march 2007 , 50 years after the signing of the treaty of rome , she will issue a " berlin declaration " , in an attempt to re-inspire europeans with the ideal of continent-wide integration and to map out europe 's common challenges .
the wording must be agreed by consensus and will be a pointer to the eu 's appetite for treaty reforms .
a rival event will also mark the eu 's 50th birthday : a celebration football match is to be played on 13 march between the two-time champions ' league cupwinners manchester united and a star " europe eleven " made up of players from across europe .
chances are there will be more popular interest in the exhibition game than in the re-heated talk of a constitution .
in june , mrs merkel is to present a more substantial " roadmap " on future treaty reforms .
but little movement can be expected until after france 's parliamentary and presidential elections in may .
foreign policy dilemmas germany aims to counter troubling developments in the former soviet union , the middle east and elsewhere .
france is spearheading the un peacekeeping mission in lebanon but in recent years the eu 's sorry internal divisions have brought a sense of drift .
the germans are themselves involved in a damaging split : poland and the baltic states strongly oppose the strategic deal done by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder and russia 's president vladimir putin in 2005 to build a new north european gas pipeline under the baltic sea .
it will supply customers in western europe , bypassing poland , the baltic states and ukraine .
since then russia 's robust use of its vast energy resources as a foreign policy tool has thrown prospects for a strategic eu-russia partnership agreement into doubt .
and the unsolved murders of several high-profile opponents of mr putin have led the europeans to question whether this russian leadership is committed to respecting civil rights and the rule of law , or even wants to be a constructive partner .
angela merkel has responded by telling mr putin diplomatically that russia 's own interests lie in democratic reforms and accepting international commercial rules .
but mr putin has proved intolerant of any criticism of his tightening grip on russia 's energy industry and its political life .
mrs merkel says a top priority will be to improve the eu 's relations not only with russia but also with countries like ukraine and georgia in europe 's " new neighbourhood " , which have complained of russian bullying .
she also plans an initative to stabilise central asia - the large , energy-rich former soviet republics like kazakhstan .
in the middle east , any breakthrough towards peace under the influence of germany 's eu presidency would be a surprise .
mrs merkel wants , with other members of the international quartet , to revive the " roadmap " for peace between israel and the palestinians .
and she has one advantage - good personal relations with us president george bush .
but with the us deeply embroiled in iraq , her ambitions may have to be limited to containing the many conflicts in the region and cajoling the main eu players to bury their long-standing policy differences .
only then might europe become a credible diplomatic force in the middle east .
energy scares energy shortages top the list of long-term threats to european security which angela merkel means to tackle .
the power of russian energy giant gazprom worries eu members a year ago , russia 's cut-off of gas to ukraine hit supplies to much of western and central europe .
at the eu 's summit in early march mrs merkel is to present an energy action plan , with proposals for protecting europe against future energy disasters .
widely divergent national energy policies within eu states now stand in the way of a common energy policy .
again , germany may be part of the problem as well as the solution .
while france and some others intend to depend more on nuclear power for their future energy needs , germany has turned its back on building new nuclear power stations , for environmental reasons .
and while britain , sweden and other countries have pressed for europe-wide deregulation of energy monopolies , germany and france still resist opening up their own networks to allow common electricity or gas grids to work for the benefit of all .
other key dossiers for germany include counter-terrorism , migration , better integration of muslim minorities inside eu states , and resuming turkey 's membership negotiations after a bitter row over cyprus .
mrs merkel and her team plan to have a joint work programme with portugal and slovenia , which will be taking over the chair of the eu in the next two half-year periods .
despite the mountain of problems much of europe looks with hope to mrs merkel 's lead .
not only is germany big enough to get things moving .
but angela merkel , in her tactful way , has also chastised other european leaders for their lack of courage in taking decisions .
" the eu sometimes works in such a way that nobody takes responsibility for what has been decided , " she complained in a recent tv interview .
" more responsibility and clarity will help us . "

by william horsley bbc news europe analyst mrs merkel has proven to be a skilful negotiator in the eu chancellor angela merkel has chosen the motto " succeeding together " for germany 's six-month eu presidency starting on 1 january - at a time of weak morale in the eu .
on the plus side , the eu is celebrating the entry of romania and bulgaria as new members , its economy is picking up and it claims global leadership on issues like climate change .
but some european leaders fear the union is close to paralysis .
its flagship economic reforms have largely stalled .
its populations complain of enlargement " fatigue " .
the risk of terrorist attack is said to be as high as ever .
and europe 's vital relationships with america and russia need repairing .
privately , some german officials admit to sleeping badly when they think about the responsibilities they face .
fresh hopes yet there are widespread hopes among eu-watchers that " angela can fix it " .
mrs merkel earned plaudits for her role in mediating a timely agreement on the eu 's long-term budget at a summit a year ago .
now germany , as europe 's largest nation and biggest economy , is being asked to revive the eu 's faltering sense of purpose .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the german presidency expects to spend a lot of energy responding to unforeseen crises on the eu 's behalf .
but he has named three ambitious goals : progress towards a new european constitution or set of decision-making rules , despite the rejection of a constitutional treaty by voters in france and the netherlands beefing up the eu 's common foreign policy , to show that europe can be effective in tackling the world 's most dangerous conflicts finding answers to the looming threat to europe 's energy security , as well as climate change and other long-term challenges .
constitutional confusion sorting out the constitutional confusion looks a forlorn hope , as any new proposals may deepen existing splits among eu nations rather than heal them .
deep divisions persist in the eu over the constitution mrs merkel wants to save as much as possible of the original draft treaty , which provided for an eu president and foreign minister at the head of new structures for common european internal and foreign policies .
at a special leaders ' meeting on 25 march 2007 , 50 years after the signing of the treaty of rome , she will issue a " berlin declaration " , in an attempt to re-inspire europeans with the ideal of continent-wide integration and to map out europe 's common challenges .
the wording must be agreed by consensus and will be a pointer to the eu 's appetite for treaty reforms .
a rival event will also mark the eu 's 50th birthday : a celebration football match is to be played on 13 march between the two-time champions ' league cupwinners manchester united and a star " europe eleven " made up of players from across europe .
chances are there will be more popular interest in the exhibition game than in the re-heated talk of a constitution .
in june , mrs merkel is to present a more substantial " roadmap " on future treaty reforms .
but little movement can be expected until after france 's parliamentary and presidential elections in may .
foreign policy dilemmas germany aims to counter troubling developments in the former soviet union , the middle east and elsewhere .
france is spearheading the un peacekeeping mission in lebanon but in recent years the eu 's sorry internal divisions have brought a sense of drift .
the germans are themselves involved in a damaging split : poland and the baltic states strongly oppose the strategic deal done by former german chancellor gerhard schroeder and russia 's president vladimir putin in 2005 to build a new north european gas pipeline under the baltic sea .
it will supply customers in western europe , bypassing poland , the baltic states and ukraine .
since then russia 's robust use of its vast energy resources as a foreign policy tool has thrown prospects for a strategic eu-russia partnership agreement into doubt .
and the unsolved murders of several high-profile opponents of mr putin have led the europeans to question whether this russian leadership is committed to respecting civil rights and the rule of law , or even wants to be a constructive partner .
angela merkel has responded by telling mr putin diplomatically that russia 's own interests lie in democratic reforms and accepting international commercial rules .

only then might europe become a credible diplomatic force in the middle east .
