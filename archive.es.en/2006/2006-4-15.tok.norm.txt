" cult of satan " " lord we have lost our sense of sin , " it said .

" it would be desirable for the government to make clear through diplomatic channels that -lrb- iranian president mahmoud -rrb- ahmadinejad 's visit to germany is not desired , " said christian union parliamentary group chief wolfgang bosbach die welt am sonntag weekly reported on friday . world soccer federation fifa should declare the iranian president persona non grata for the duration of the tournament , christian democratic state party spokesman georg brunnhuber said .
" the european union should … back germany in declaring him persona non grata . " " one should make it clear to ahmadinejad that he should refrain from visiting germany , " said christian union domestic affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl .
government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .
government spokesman thomas steg said on monday that it was still not foreseeable whether the iranian leader would come to germany . neither the german soccer association dsb , nor fifa nor the german government had invited him , steg said . ahmadinejad presses on unfazed by his critics in europe and washington - who have put increasing pressure on iran over its disputed nuclear drive - the iranian president again attacked israel and called the holocaust into question on friday . " the zionist regime is an injustice and by its very nature a permanent threat , " ahmadinejad told a tehran conference meant to rally support for the cash-strapped hamas-led palestinian government .
" whether you like it or not , the zionist regime is on the road to being eliminated , " said ahmadinejad , whose regime does not recognize israel and who drew international condemnation last year when he said israel should be " wiped off the map . " " if there is serious doubt over the holocaust , there is no doubt over the catastrophe and holocaust being faced by the palestinians , " said the president , who had previously dismissed as a " myth " the killing of an estimated 6 million jews by the nazis and their allies during world war ii .
" i tell the governments who support zionism to ... let the migrants -lrb- jews -rrb- return to their countries of origin .
if you think you owe them something , give them some of your land , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have been increasing the pressure on palestinian prime minister haniyeh eu foreign ministers on monday formally backed plans for a temporary aid suspension to the palestinian government , having called on hamas to renounce violence , recognize israel and abide by previous palestinian commitments . the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels and the rest from individual eu governments . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's president considers following team in germany the iranian football federation said thursday that the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , could attend this summmer 's world cup finals in germany along with 4,000 iranian fans .

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .
" this festival has nothing to do with him .
the whole world is going crazy about mozart -lrb- who was born 250 years ago -rrb- this year .

" oliver kahn will be in the ad because he belongs to the best soccer players in the world , " said adidas spokesman jan runau . the irony of his role in a commercial for bitburger beer could hardly have been anticipated when the trailer was produced earlier this year .
in the ad , in which the national team plays soccer in a restaurant , a shot by bastian schweinsteiger zooms towards the head of unsuspecting coach jürgen klinsmann .
kahn , however , stops the ball just before it would have struck the man who scorned him just over a week ago . bitburger said there is no reason to change the commercial .
the brewer purposely used kahn in the ad because no other player polarizes germany 's soccer fans more , it stated . despite the downgrade to number 2 , kahn is a national icon who achieves instant recognition across germany .
riding on the wave of success in both the bundesliga and the 2002 world cup in japan and south korea , he earned up to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in advertising fees in 2004 - in addition to his 6 million euro salary from bayern . all in all , nine companies sponsor kahn . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?

" cult of satan " " lord we have lost our sense of sin , " it said .
" today a slick campaign of propaganda is spreading an inane apologia of evil , a senseless cult of satan , a mindless desire for transgression , a dishonest and frivolous freedom , exalting impulsiveness , immorality and selfishness as if they were new heights of sophistication … .

" it would be desirable for the government to make clear through diplomatic channels that -lrb- iranian president mahmoud -rrb- ahmadinejad 's visit to germany is not desired , " said christian union parliamentary group chief wolfgang bosbach die welt am sonntag weekly reported on friday . world soccer federation fifa should declare the iranian president persona non grata for the duration of the tournament , christian democratic state party spokesman georg brunnhuber said .
" the european union should … back germany in declaring him persona non grata . " " one should make it clear to ahmadinejad that he should refrain from visiting germany , " said christian union domestic affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl .
government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .
government spokesman thomas steg said on monday that it was still not foreseeable whether the iranian leader would come to germany . neither the german soccer association dsb , nor fifa nor the german government had invited him , steg said . ahmadinejad presses on unfazed by his critics in europe and washington - who have put increasing pressure on iran over its disputed nuclear drive - the iranian president again attacked israel and called the holocaust into question on friday . " the zionist regime is an injustice and by its very nature a permanent threat , " ahmadinejad told a tehran conference meant to rally support for the cash-strapped hamas-led palestinian government .
" whether you like it or not , the zionist regime is on the road to being eliminated , " said ahmadinejad , whose regime does not recognize israel and who drew international condemnation last year when he said israel should be " wiped off the map . " " if there is serious doubt over the holocaust , there is no doubt over the catastrophe and holocaust being faced by the palestinians , " said the president , who had previously dismissed as a " myth " the killing of an estimated 6 million jews by the nazis and their allies during world war ii .
" i tell the governments who support zionism to ... let the migrants -lrb- jews -rrb- return to their countries of origin .
if you think you owe them something , give them some of your land , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have been increasing the pressure on palestinian prime minister haniyeh eu foreign ministers on monday formally backed plans for a temporary aid suspension to the palestinian government , having called on hamas to renounce violence , recognize israel and abide by previous palestinian commitments . the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels and the rest from individual eu governments . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's president considers following team in germany the iranian football federation said thursday that the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , could attend this summmer 's world cup finals in germany along with 4,000 iranian fans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2006 germany aims for seat on new un human rights council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been working to increase its international role on may 9 , the united nations general assembly will decide which countries will share the 47 seats of the newly created un human rights council .
germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks . " for germany to play that new role , however , the united nations general assembly must first elect it to the human rights council . nina werkhhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report damns global powers amnesty international 's 2005 report , published wednesday , condemns 149 countries including germany and the united states for differing policies that it claims constitute abuses of human rights .

" it would be desirable for the government to make clear through diplomatic channels that -lrb- iranian president mahmoud -rrb- ahmadinejad 's visit to germany is not desired , " said christian union parliamentary group chief wolfgang bosbach die welt am sonntag weekly reported on friday . world soccer federation fifa should declare the iranian president persona non grata for the duration of the tournament , christian democratic state party spokesman georg brunnhuber said .
" the european union should … back germany in declaring him persona non grata . " " one should make it clear to ahmadinejad that he should refrain from visiting germany , " said christian union domestic affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl .
government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .
government spokesman thomas steg said on monday that it was still not foreseeable whether the iranian leader would come to germany . neither the german soccer association dsb , nor fifa nor the german government had invited him , steg said . ahmadinejad presses on unfazed by his critics in europe and washington - who have put increasing pressure on iran over its disputed nuclear drive - the iranian president again attacked israel and called the holocaust into question on friday . " the zionist regime is an injustice and by its very nature a permanent threat , " ahmadinejad told a tehran conference meant to rally support for the cash-strapped hamas-led palestinian government .
" whether you like it or not , the zionist regime is on the road to being eliminated , " said ahmadinejad , whose regime does not recognize israel and who drew international condemnation last year when he said israel should be " wiped off the map . " " if there is serious doubt over the holocaust , there is no doubt over the catastrophe and holocaust being faced by the palestinians , " said the president , who had previously dismissed as a " myth " the killing of an estimated 6 million jews by the nazis and their allies during world war ii .
" i tell the governments who support zionism to ... let the migrants -lrb- jews -rrb- return to their countries of origin .
if you think you owe them something , give them some of your land , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2006 germany aims for seat on new un human rights council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been working to increase its international role on may 9 , the united nations general assembly will decide which countries will share the 47 seats of the newly created un human rights council .
germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks . " for germany to play that new role , however , the united nations general assembly must first elect it to the human rights council . nina werkhhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report damns global powers amnesty international 's 2005 report , published wednesday , condemns 149 countries including germany and the united states for differing policies that it claims constitute abuses of human rights .

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .
" this festival has nothing to do with him .
the whole world is going crazy about mozart -lrb- who was born 250 years ago -rrb- this year .
we decided instead to focus on a great french composer - marin marais .
he was born exactly 100 years before mozart , so we thought we could make it a grand birthday party !

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .
" this festival has nothing to do with him .
the whole world is going crazy about mozart -lrb- who was born 250 years ago -rrb- this year .
we decided instead to focus on a great french composer - marin marais .
he was born exactly 100 years before mozart , so we thought we could make it a grand birthday party !

" oliver kahn will be in the ad because he belongs to the best soccer players in the world , " said adidas spokesman jan runau . the irony of his role in a commercial for bitburger beer could hardly have been anticipated when the trailer was produced earlier this year .
in the ad , in which the national team plays soccer in a restaurant , a shot by bastian schweinsteiger zooms towards the head of unsuspecting coach jürgen klinsmann .
kahn , however , stops the ball just before it would have struck the man who scorned him just over a week ago . bitburger said there is no reason to change the commercial .
the brewer purposely used kahn in the ad because no other player polarizes germany 's soccer fans more , it stated . despite the downgrade to number 2 , kahn is a national icon who achieves instant recognition across germany .
riding on the wave of success in both the bundesliga and the 2002 world cup in japan and south korea , he earned up to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in advertising fees in 2004 - in addition to his 6 million euro salary from bayern . all in all , nine companies sponsor kahn . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?

-lrb- april 10 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .

germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks . " for germany to play that new role , however , the united nations general assembly must first elect it to the human rights council . nina werkhhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report damns global powers amnesty international 's 2005 report , published wednesday , condemns 149 countries including germany and the united states for differing policies that it claims constitute abuses of human rights .

germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks .

riding on the wave of success in both the bundesliga and the 2002 world cup in japan and south korea , he earned up to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in advertising fees in 2004 - in addition to his 6 million euro salary from bayern . all in all , nine companies sponsor kahn . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?

government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .
government spokesman thomas steg said on monday that it was still not foreseeable whether the iranian leader would come to germany . neither the german soccer association dsb , nor fifa nor the german government had invited him , steg said . ahmadinejad presses on unfazed by his critics in europe and washington - who have put increasing pressure on iran over its disputed nuclear drive - the iranian president again attacked israel and called the holocaust into question on friday . " the zionist regime is an injustice and by its very nature a permanent threat , " ahmadinejad told a tehran conference meant to rally support for the cash-strapped hamas-led palestinian government .
" whether you like it or not , the zionist regime is on the road to being eliminated , " said ahmadinejad , whose regime does not recognize israel and who drew international condemnation last year when he said israel should be " wiped off the map . " " if there is serious doubt over the holocaust , there is no doubt over the catastrophe and holocaust being faced by the palestinians , " said the president , who had previously dismissed as a " myth " the killing of an estimated 6 million jews by the nazis and their allies during world war ii .
" i tell the governments who support zionism to ... let the migrants -lrb- jews -rrb- return to their countries of origin .
if you think you owe them something , give them some of your land , " he said .

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .
" this festival has nothing to do with him .
the whole world is going crazy about mozart -lrb- who was born 250 years ago -rrb- this year .
we decided instead to focus on a great french composer - marin marais .
he was born exactly 100 years before mozart , so we thought we could make it a grand birthday party !

" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .

we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .
" this festival has nothing to do with him .
the whole world is going crazy about mozart -lrb- who was born 250 years ago -rrb- this year .
we decided instead to focus on a great french composer - marin marais .
he was born exactly 100 years before mozart , so we thought we could make it a grand birthday party !

kahn , however , stops the ball just before it would have struck the man who scorned him just over a week ago . bitburger said there is no reason to change the commercial .
the brewer purposely used kahn in the ad because no other player polarizes germany 's soccer fans more , it stated . despite the downgrade to number 2 , kahn is a national icon who achieves instant recognition across germany .
riding on the wave of success in both the bundesliga and the 2002 world cup in japan and south korea , he earned up to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in advertising fees in 2004 - in addition to his 6 million euro salary from bayern . all in all , nine companies sponsor kahn . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?

germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks . " for germany to play that new role , however , the united nations general assembly must first elect it to the human rights council . nina werkhhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report damns global powers amnesty international 's 2005 report , published wednesday , condemns 149 countries including germany and the united states for differing policies that it claims constitute abuses of human rights .

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .

" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .

" composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .

germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .

in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .

" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks . " for germany to play that new role , however , the united nations general assembly must first elect it to the human rights council . nina werkhhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report damns global powers amnesty international 's 2005 report , published wednesday , condemns 149 countries including germany and the united states for differing policies that it claims constitute abuses of human rights .

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .
" this festival has nothing to do with him .
the whole world is going crazy about mozart -lrb- who was born 250 years ago -rrb- this year .
we decided instead to focus on a great french composer - marin marais .
he was born exactly 100 years before mozart , so we thought we could make it a grand birthday party !

germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks . " for germany to play that new role , however , the united nations general assembly must first elect it to the human rights council . nina werkhhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report damns global powers amnesty international 's 2005 report , published wednesday , condemns 149 countries including germany and the united states for differing policies that it claims constitute abuses of human rights .

" oliver kahn will be in the ad because he belongs to the best soccer players in the world , " said adidas spokesman jan runau . the irony of his role in a commercial for bitburger beer could hardly have been anticipated when the trailer was produced earlier this year .
in the ad , in which the national team plays soccer in a restaurant , a shot by bastian schweinsteiger zooms towards the head of unsuspecting coach jürgen klinsmann .
kahn , however , stops the ball just before it would have struck the man who scorned him just over a week ago . bitburger said there is no reason to change the commercial .
the brewer purposely used kahn in the ad because no other player polarizes germany 's soccer fans more , it stated . despite the downgrade to number 2 , kahn is a national icon who achieves instant recognition across germany .
riding on the wave of success in both the bundesliga and the 2002 world cup in japan and south korea , he earned up to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in advertising fees in 2004 - in addition to his 6 million euro salary from bayern . all in all , nine companies sponsor kahn . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?

" cult of satan " " lord we have lost our sense of sin , " it said .
" today a slick campaign of propaganda is spreading an inane apologia of evil , a senseless cult of satan , a mindless desire for transgression , a dishonest and frivolous freedom , exalting impulsiveness , immorality and selfishness as if they were new heights of sophistication … .
lord jesus , open our eyes , let us see the filth around us for what it is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope waved to the faithful from the square of the temple of venus in rome during the late-night ceremony friday , the cross was carried in turn around the ancient roman amphitheater by an italian family , an american seminarist , a young nun , two franciscan monks from the holy land , and young people from nigeria , angola , korea and mexico in an effort to reflect the universality of the church . the pope himself , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , had prepared the meditations for last year 's ceremony , which a dying pope john paul ii watched on television in his private chapel at the vatican .

in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .

germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .

" it would be desirable for the government to make clear through diplomatic channels that -lrb- iranian president mahmoud -rrb- ahmadinejad 's visit to germany is not desired , " said christian union parliamentary group chief wolfgang bosbach die welt am sonntag weekly reported on friday . world soccer federation fifa should declare the iranian president persona non grata for the duration of the tournament , christian democratic state party spokesman georg brunnhuber said .
" the european union should … back germany in declaring him persona non grata . " " one should make it clear to ahmadinejad that he should refrain from visiting germany , " said christian union domestic affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl .
government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .

" the zionist regime is an injustice and by its very nature a permanent threat , " ahmadinejad told a tehran conference meant to rally support for the cash-strapped hamas-led palestinian government .
" whether you like it or not , the zionist regime is on the road to being eliminated , " said ahmadinejad , whose regime does not recognize israel and who drew international condemnation last year when he said israel should be " wiped off the map . " " if there is serious doubt over the holocaust , there is no doubt over the catastrophe and holocaust being faced by the palestinians , " said the president , who had previously dismissed as a " myth " the killing of an estimated 6 million jews by the nazis and their allies during world war ii .
" i tell the governments who support zionism to ... let the migrants -lrb- jews -rrb- return to their countries of origin .
if you think you owe them something , give them some of your land , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have been increasing the pressure on palestinian prime minister haniyeh eu foreign ministers on monday formally backed plans for a temporary aid suspension to the palestinian government , having called on hamas to renounce violence , recognize israel and abide by previous palestinian commitments . the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels and the rest from individual eu governments . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's president considers following team in germany the iranian football federation said thursday that the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , could attend this summmer 's world cup finals in germany along with 4,000 iranian fans .

" it would be desirable for the government to make clear through diplomatic channels that -lrb- iranian president mahmoud -rrb- ahmadinejad 's visit to germany is not desired , " said christian union parliamentary group chief wolfgang bosbach die welt am sonntag weekly reported on friday . world soccer federation fifa should declare the iranian president persona non grata for the duration of the tournament , christian democratic state party spokesman georg brunnhuber said .
" the european union should … back germany in declaring him persona non grata . " " one should make it clear to ahmadinejad that he should refrain from visiting germany , " said christian union domestic affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl .
government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .

" it would be desirable for the government to make clear through diplomatic channels that -lrb- iranian president mahmoud -rrb- ahmadinejad 's visit to germany is not desired , " said christian union parliamentary group chief wolfgang bosbach die welt am sonntag weekly reported on friday . world soccer federation fifa should declare the iranian president persona non grata for the duration of the tournament , christian democratic state party spokesman georg brunnhuber said .
" the european union should … back germany in declaring him persona non grata . " " one should make it clear to ahmadinejad that he should refrain from visiting germany , " said christian union domestic affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl .
government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .
government spokesman thomas steg said on monday that it was still not foreseeable whether the iranian leader would come to germany . neither the german soccer association dsb , nor fifa nor the german government had invited him , steg said . ahmadinejad presses on unfazed by his critics in europe and washington - who have put increasing pressure on iran over its disputed nuclear drive - the iranian president again attacked israel and called the holocaust into question on friday . " the zionist regime is an injustice and by its very nature a permanent threat , " ahmadinejad told a tehran conference meant to rally support for the cash-strapped hamas-led palestinian government .

germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .

a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks .

" that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks .

germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line .

" the 10-day early music festival saw performances of the first german ever opera libretto as well as world premieres of avant-garde music .
nigel north , hopkinson smith and paul o ’ dette - the best lutenists in the world - played music by the greatest lute player and composer of all time : john dowland . the three lutenist stars sparked intimate musical moments in berlin 's grand konzerthaus .
they transposed the audience back to the days of the 17th century through john dowland 's lute works .
the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.04.2006 germany aims for seat on new un human rights council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been working to increase its international role on may 9 , the united nations general assembly will decide which countries will share the 47 seats of the newly created un human rights council .
germany is among the applicants . sixty years after its founding , the human rights commission must face the fact that it has long been ineffective .
the upcoming un human rights council is supposed to change that .
germany was one of the first countries to submit its application to be a part of the new council 's establishment .
but germany 's membership is not a sure bet ; after all , there are only seven seats reserved for the entire group of western european nations , and each country must be elected to the council with an absolute majority from the un general assembly . germany must think strategically to win over support from other countries , especially since it has many european competitors vying for human rights council seats - competitors who boast impressive records for respecting and actively promoting human rights . germany wants to boast with eu presidency " people have different opinions about which countries should be members , but we are going to advertise with germany 's eu presidency role in 2007 , " said the country 's human rights commissioner , günther nooke .
" it is a position that many respect , especially those reviewing our candidacy and deciding whether we should be a member . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists in china nooke would like to see germany on the un humans rights council from the start and to maintain the position for at least several years .
a country may only be voted onto the council for two terms , so even the five powerful , permanent members of the un security council would have to end their membership on the human rights body after six years .
however , not all of them even want a seat on the new council .
nooke said he regretted that the united states , for instance , will not be a candidate in the may 9 election . " i do n't think that germany and europe can distinguish themselves from the united states in this area , " he said .
" i personally would rather be on the side of the human rights policies of the united states than those of vladimir putin . " us opposed council the united states is one of the few countries which voted against the establishment of the human rights council .
it argued that the improvements to the previous body were not far-reaching enough .
though nooke recognized problems , he also stressed the opportunities the new body could offer . " it is surely an advantage when council members can vote out countries which have seriously abused human rights , " nooke said . in addition , human rights council members must tolerate being continually reviewed .
in the future , it will hardly be possible for countries like zimbabwe , sudan or china , for instance , to stand in the way of un human rights work without having to fear that they themselves will be criticized somewhere down the line . " that means making the best of the situation , " nooke said .
" germany is very determined to fully apply the important , responsible and internationally recognized role it has played in the human rights commission when the new council soon begins defining its tasks . " for germany to play that new role , however , the united nations general assembly must first elect it to the human rights council . nina werkhhäuser -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report damns global powers amnesty international 's 2005 report , published wednesday , condemns 149 countries including germany and the united states for differing policies that it claims constitute abuses of human rights .

" it would be desirable for the government to make clear through diplomatic channels that -lrb- iranian president mahmoud -rrb- ahmadinejad 's visit to germany is not desired , " said christian union parliamentary group chief wolfgang bosbach die welt am sonntag weekly reported on friday . world soccer federation fifa should declare the iranian president persona non grata for the duration of the tournament , christian democratic state party spokesman georg brunnhuber said .
" the european union should … back germany in declaring him persona non grata . " " one should make it clear to ahmadinejad that he should refrain from visiting germany , " said christian union domestic affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl .
government " at a loss " the german government has so far not taken a position on a possible visit by the iranian president .
" we are still at a loss as to what we should do if ahmadinejad wants to experience his national team 's games live in germany , " the rheinische post daily on saturday quoted a government official as saying .
he added that there were " clear signals " that the european union was seriously considering imposing a bloc-wide ban on iran 's political leadership such as has been applied to belarusian leaders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad may well want to watch his team play in person " that would be an elegant solution for our problem , because we could then deny ahmadinejad entry , " the chancellery official said .
government spokesman thomas steg said on monday that it was still not foreseeable whether the iranian leader would come to germany . neither the german soccer association dsb , nor fifa nor the german government had invited him , steg said . ahmadinejad presses on unfazed by his critics in europe and washington - who have put increasing pressure on iran over its disputed nuclear drive - the iranian president again attacked israel and called the holocaust into question on friday . " the zionist regime is an injustice and by its very nature a permanent threat , " ahmadinejad told a tehran conference meant to rally support for the cash-strapped hamas-led palestinian government .
" whether you like it or not , the zionist regime is on the road to being eliminated , " said ahmadinejad , whose regime does not recognize israel and who drew international condemnation last year when he said israel should be " wiped off the map . " " if there is serious doubt over the holocaust , there is no doubt over the catastrophe and holocaust being faced by the palestinians , " said the president , who had previously dismissed as a " myth " the killing of an estimated 6 million jews by the nazis and their allies during world war ii .
" i tell the governments who support zionism to ... let the migrants -lrb- jews -rrb- return to their countries of origin .
if you think you owe them something , give them some of your land , " he said .

the works were originally written for french and english courts and convey the melancholy that was so fashionable in music at the time , with " pavane " being one of dowland 's 17th century hits . musical revolution the 17th century witnessed a major revolution in music .
it was a period when italian composers dominated the musical world .
famous german composers like heinrich schütz traveled across the alps to study with claudio monteverdi and his contemporaries in venice and rome .
" seconda prattica " was the new musical school in italy , where language had precedence over music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian alps as " zeitfenster " festival director folkert uhde pointed out , when german composers returned home , they faced another challenge . " the composers said : ' we ca n't just leave it all to the italians ! '
they agreed that they had to find a way of putting the german language to music , " uhde said .
" they wanted the audiences back home to understand the content of what was then avant-garde music . " 17th-century musicians loved to experiment musicians experimented widely in 17th-century germany .
so the " zeitfenster " organizers decided to take audiences on a voyage to discover that adventuresome musical history .
it was a courageous act for folkert uhde and festival makers to present the largely unfamiliar repertoire of german songs and madrigals to festival-goers . german soprano annette dasch has established a career singing romantic opera in tokyo , paris , salzburg and dresden .
at this year 's " zeitfenster , " she performed an unknown compositions by heinrich albert , andreas hammerschmidt and johann krieger . " the music is very direct and modern , " dasch said .
" it just grabs you .
it goes straight to your heart and also makes you laugh .
even if you 're a modern person , you understand every word .
and the emotional message from 400 years ago lives on - even today ! " composers mix the old and the new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recently discovered bach composition berlin 's " zeitfenster " festival not only showcased concerts of rarely performed music , but it also brought together traditional and avant-garde music .
the first ever german opera premiered in 1627 .
the opera 's libretto - or text - by martin opitz still exists , but the music by heinrich schütz has been lost . " so we commissioned three young composers in berlin to write new music to the libretto from 1627 , " uhde said .
" they were told which instruments and which singers to write for - just as it was done 400 years ago .
we also asked them to compose three new versions of the old opera , each limited to 30 minutes . " some of the 14 " zeitfenster " concerts featured early vocal music , while others presented the development of instrumental dance music as an art form in its own right .
musicians performed work by neglected composer georg caspar schürmann - once considered bach 's and händel 's equal - and played brahms ' " requiem . "
surprisingly , though , wolfgang amadeus mozart did not appear on the program bill . " please , no mozart , " uhde said .
" this festival has nothing to do with him .
the whole world is going crazy about mozart -lrb- who was born 250 years ago -rrb- this year .
we decided instead to focus on a great french composer - marin marais .
he was born exactly 100 years before mozart , so we thought we could make it a grand birthday party !

hardly any in fact .
it is one of the reasons why , for the moment , video games will continue to struggle against the movie and music stars for newspaper column inches .
after all , as an editor choosing what to put in an entertainment section , do you go with pictures of robbie and an interview about life on tour ?
or do you go instead for the latest screenshots of a video game , along with some words from the game 's developer ?
this is precisely why british games company eidos have spent so much time and effort over the years trying to convert lara croft from a computer-generated beauty into a living , breathing person .
lara is the main character in the widely popular tomb raider games , that have sold more than 28 million copies worldwide since the pixel vixen first wowed gamers in 1996 .
nell mcandrew and angelina jolie have both taken on the persona .
now , 20-year-old karima adebibe from east london is the latest person to don the famous tomb raider outfit of guns and shorts .
speaking role karima is the first person that eidos have actually entrusted to " be " lara , meaning that she is allowed to speak as the character , rather than just pose .
in the game , lara croft is an english aristocrat and world-renowned archaeological expert , as well as an unparalleled athlete and fluent arabic speaker .
it involves acting , skills , so much more than just modelling .
it 's not your normal job karima adebibe tomb raider tops charts so eidos has sent karima on all kinds of training , from the obvious combat and motorcycle routines through to the less obvious , such as elocution and deportment .
" in the beginning , it was a little bit surreal , " she told radio five live 's up all night .
" but because of all the training , i really do feel like lara croft now .
it 's incredible . "
from eidos ' point of view , as long as karima stays on message , it is a win-win scenario .
on the one hand it has the latest tomb raider game itself , called legend , and can dish out screenshots and movies ad infinitum .
on the other hand it has karima who can tour the tv and radio stations , charming the hosts and generating more webcam clicks than is probably healthy .
becoming lara for somebody who was a part-time model and part-time shop assistant , this 12-month contract is a good break , and rather different to what she was doing before .
jolie is up for playing lara croft on film again " it involves acting , skills , so much more than just modelling , " she said .
" it 's not your normal job . "
" i want to do it as well as i possibly can , i 'm putting my heart and soul into it . "
it probably helps that she has dabbled in gaming herself , and played the first two tomb raider games a few years back .
for somebody as enthusiastic for the role , even when not dressed in the garb , it is almost a shame that should paramount decide on shooting a third tomb raider film , angelina jolie will play the role again .
but that is not something that bothers karima .
" no , we love angelina , she 's amazing .
she is the hollywood lara croft .

this week , in a farmer 's field near ypres , a group of amateur historians found the remains of three soldiers from the first world war .
two of the bodies bore no identification , although one still had half its uniform , as well as a spoon , fork and a bayonet .
on the third , the historians found an identification tag .
the chain had been broken and the tag pushed forward into the skull , probably by a farmer 's plough passing over it .
the tag was badly corroded , but they were able to decipher a number , 8372 , and a surname , lancaster .
they also found a cap badge and shoulder titles .
' great feeling ' the historians have provisionally identified the body as that of private richard lancaster , of the lancashire fusiliers .
based on information from the 1901 census , they believe he was born in preston in 1883 and died on 10 november 1914 , during the first battle of ypres .
emmanuel bril , who first found the remains , says the identification is a real breakthrough .
" that 's great news , a great feeling , because i think maybe he had a son and a wife .
it 's very important for me , but also for the family . "
this group of amateur historians made the discovery however , it will be up to the commonwealth war graves commission and the ministry of defence to make a final identification .
such finds are not uncommon , although identifications are rare .
the battlefields around the ypres salient covered 25 square kilometres .
more than 250,000 british and commonwealth soldiers died there in three major battles .
around 90,000 are officially missing .
their names are listed on three major memorials to the missing .
private lancaster 's name is on the memorial at plug street wood , as the british tommies dubbed the village of ploegsteert .
a looming rotunda of white stone , guarded by the statues of two enormous lions , it bears the names of 11,447 missing soldiers .
cross and poppies one of them is that of harry wilkinson , like richard lancaster a private in the lancashire fusiliers .
six years ago , his remains were found near the site of this week 's discovery and identified .
a small white-painted cross and a wreath of red paper poppies now marks the spot where he fell .
his family have come over to visit his grave .
every five years , the stone plaques on the memorial are replaced to take account of newly identified bodies .
british battlefield guide iain mchenry has seen the way such identifications affect the families .
some 12,000 bodies are laid to rest at tyne cot cemetery " you hope that if this soldier is identified as private lancaster , that he does have surviving family out there .
this is something that means a lot to people .
" it 's amazing to be able to point out a name on a memorial or a grave to family who have never visited before .
sometimes you have people visiting their great-grandfather and they are the first members of the family to have visited . "
only a handful of survivors of the first world war are still alive .
the director of the in flanders fields museum in ypres , piet chielens , says the recent find at plug street wood reminds people of the impact of what was called the great war .
" it gives the war a face again .
hopefully they will be able to trace the family and a photograph , and all of a sudden , the stones will speak up again .
we are surrounded by those stones , but they are silent , until you can tell a personal story . "
' so moving ' the biggest commonwealth war cemetery in the world is at tyne cot , near the site of the third battle of ypres -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , also known as passchendaele .
there are 12,000 headstones there : some with names , some without .
the names of the missing are carved on a wall at the back .
the wind whistles in off the north sea .
the clouds hang low over the land .
three british visitors are walking up and down the rows , reading the inscriptions on the stones .
" it 's so moving because of the conditions they had to endure , " said simon shields of grantham , lincs .
many gather each year to pay tribute to the fallen " it 's the whole thing of they thought it would be over by christmas .
they died so we could have the freedom we 've got today , and at the end of the day , people seem to forget that .
" i honestly believe politicians ought to be brought to places like these to see what happens when wars are fought .
we need history .
it helps shape the future . "
it was the first time john swann from nottingham had visited any sites from world war i.
" all i can see is a mass of graves here : 12,000 men in this cemetery alone .
you look at the headstones and you see they 're all 19 , 20 , 21 years old , these young men in their prime , who came overseas .
in those days it was a million miles away from home . "
jonathan parry from liverpool had been interested in the war since his school days .
two of his great-grandfathers fought in the war .
one was underage when he joined up .
both survived .
" people rush to certain graves and yet there are soldiers who 've never had a visit , " he said .
" it 's important that people visit those graves as well . "

this week , in a farmer 's field near ypres , a group of amateur historians found the remains of three soldiers from the first world war .
two of the bodies bore no identification , although one still had half its uniform , as well as a spoon , fork and a bayonet .
on the third , the historians found an identification tag .
the chain had been broken and the tag pushed forward into the skull , probably by a farmer 's plough passing over it .
the tag was badly corroded , but they were able to decipher a number , 8372 , and a surname , lancaster .
they also found a cap badge and shoulder titles .
' great feeling ' the historians have provisionally identified the body as that of private richard lancaster , of the lancashire fusiliers .
based on information from the 1901 census , they believe he was born in preston in 1883 and died on 10 november 1914 , during the first battle of ypres .
emmanuel bril , who first found the remains , says the identification is a real breakthrough .
" that 's great news , a great feeling , because i think maybe he had a son and a wife .
it 's very important for me , but also for the family . "
this group of amateur historians made the discovery however , it will be up to the commonwealth war graves commission and the ministry of defence to make a final identification .
such finds are not uncommon , although identifications are rare .
the battlefields around the ypres salient covered 25 square kilometres .
more than 250,000 british and commonwealth soldiers died there in three major battles .
around 90,000 are officially missing .
their names are listed on three major memorials to the missing .
private lancaster 's name is on the memorial at plug street wood , as the british tommies dubbed the village of ploegsteert .
a looming rotunda of white stone , guarded by the statues of two enormous lions , it bears the names of 11,447 missing soldiers .
cross and poppies one of them is that of harry wilkinson , like richard lancaster a private in the lancashire fusiliers .
six years ago , his remains were found near the site of this week 's discovery and identified .
a small white-painted cross and a wreath of red paper poppies now marks the spot where he fell .
his family have come over to visit his grave .
every five years , the stone plaques on the memorial are replaced to take account of newly identified bodies .
british battlefield guide iain mchenry has seen the way such identifications affect the families .
some 12,000 bodies are laid to rest at tyne cot cemetery " you hope that if this soldier is identified as private lancaster , that he does have surviving family out there .
this is something that means a lot to people .
" it 's amazing to be able to point out a name on a memorial or a grave to family who have never visited before .
sometimes you have people visiting their great-grandfather and they are the first members of the family to have visited . "
only a handful of survivors of the first world war are still alive .
the director of the in flanders fields museum in ypres , piet chielens , says the recent find at plug street wood reminds people of the impact of what was called the great war .
" it gives the war a face again .
hopefully they will be able to trace the family and a photograph , and all of a sudden , the stones will speak up again .
we are surrounded by those stones , but they are silent , until you can tell a personal story . "
' so moving ' the biggest commonwealth war cemetery in the world is at tyne cot , near the site of the third battle of ypres -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , also known as passchendaele .
there are 12,000 headstones there : some with names , some without .
the names of the missing are carved on a wall at the back .
the wind whistles in off the north sea .
the clouds hang low over the land .
three british visitors are walking up and down the rows , reading the inscriptions on the stones .
" it 's so moving because of the conditions they had to endure , " said simon shields of grantham , lincs .
many gather each year to pay tribute to the fallen " it 's the whole thing of they thought it would be over by christmas .
they died so we could have the freedom we 've got today , and at the end of the day , people seem to forget that .
" i honestly believe politicians ought to be brought to places like these to see what happens when wars are fought .
we need history .
it helps shape the future . "
it was the first time john swann from nottingham had visited any sites from world war i.
" all i can see is a mass of graves here : 12,000 men in this cemetery alone .
you look at the headstones and you see they 're all 19 , 20 , 21 years old , these young men in their prime , who came overseas .

this week , in a farmer 's field near ypres , a group of amateur historians found the remains of three soldiers from the first world war .
two of the bodies bore no identification , although one still had half its uniform , as well as a spoon , fork and a bayonet .
on the third , the historians found an identification tag .
the chain had been broken and the tag pushed forward into the skull , probably by a farmer 's plough passing over it .
the tag was badly corroded , but they were able to decipher a number , 8372 , and a surname , lancaster .
they also found a cap badge and shoulder titles .
' great feeling ' the historians have provisionally identified the body as that of private richard lancaster , of the lancashire fusiliers .
based on information from the 1901 census , they believe he was born in preston in 1883 and died on 10 november 1914 , during the first battle of ypres .
emmanuel bril , who first found the remains , says the identification is a real breakthrough .
" that 's great news , a great feeling , because i think maybe he had a son and a wife .
it 's very important for me , but also for the family . "
this group of amateur historians made the discovery however , it will be up to the commonwealth war graves commission and the ministry of defence to make a final identification .
such finds are not uncommon , although identifications are rare .
the battlefields around the ypres salient covered 25 square kilometres .
more than 250,000 british and commonwealth soldiers died there in three major battles .
around 90,000 are officially missing .
their names are listed on three major memorials to the missing .
private lancaster 's name is on the memorial at plug street wood , as the british tommies dubbed the village of ploegsteert .
a looming rotunda of white stone , guarded by the statues of two enormous lions , it bears the names of 11,447 missing soldiers .
cross and poppies one of them is that of harry wilkinson , like richard lancaster a private in the lancashire fusiliers .
six years ago , his remains were found near the site of this week 's discovery and identified .
a small white-painted cross and a wreath of red paper poppies now marks the spot where he fell .
his family have come over to visit his grave .
every five years , the stone plaques on the memorial are replaced to take account of newly identified bodies .
british battlefield guide iain mchenry has seen the way such identifications affect the families .
some 12,000 bodies are laid to rest at tyne cot cemetery " you hope that if this soldier is identified as private lancaster , that he does have surviving family out there .
this is something that means a lot to people .
" it 's amazing to be able to point out a name on a memorial or a grave to family who have never visited before .
sometimes you have people visiting their great-grandfather and they are the first members of the family to have visited . "
only a handful of survivors of the first world war are still alive .
the director of the in flanders fields museum in ypres , piet chielens , says the recent find at plug street wood reminds people of the impact of what was called the great war .
" it gives the war a face again .
hopefully they will be able to trace the family and a photograph , and all of a sudden , the stones will speak up again .
we are surrounded by those stones , but they are silent , until you can tell a personal story . "

the incoming president of the national union of teachers , judy moorhouse , said the estimated cost of the scheme was " a massive waste . "
she challenged the education secretary to share it out , letting schools and their communities decide how best to raise standards free from " obnoxious interference " .
the government argues that academies are improving education quickly in poor parts of the country where nothing else has worked .
but ms moorhouse said community schools would remain " democratically accountable " - unlike academies and the " trust schools " proposed in the current education bill .
founding aims the new president is a secondary school special needs teacher in a comprehensive in richmond , north yorkshire .
she also chairs the general teaching council for england .
she was addressing the nut 's annual conference , being held in torquay in devon .
she recalled one of the union 's original aims from when it was founded in 1870 .
this was " freedom from obnoxious interference " in the running of schools .
she accused the government of being keen to encourage such interference by unwelcome individuals and pressure groups .
she called on the education secretary , ruth kelly - " as a committed labour politician " - to battle for " the total abolition of selection by ability " .
she said ms kelly should go beyond the new ban on admissions interviews by outlawing auditions , oral and practical tests for selection by " aptitude " .
" guaranteed fair access and an end to selection would help all of us in our joint enterprise to reduce underachievement , " she said .
" but now i truly am in the realms of fantasy , " she added .
the government 's target is to have 200 academies by 2010 .
sponsors put in £ 2m in return for control of how the school is run within national guidelines .
the government puts in typically another £ 25m of capital and pays the running costs .
earlier the nut general secretary , steve sinnott , also argued for more widespread support for struggling schools .
' popular with parents ' he told journalists the union wanted to mobilise parents against academies as well as trust schools - which enjoy some academy-like freedoms and have external partners but not the financial sponsorship .
he was asked how realistic that was when - as the government points out - academies were generally very popular with parents and their results were rising .
he said he could see the scenario where a school did not have good results , had problems and " slum buildings " .
" to say to the parents , ' we wish you to oppose having £ 30m spent on your school ' - that 's a difficult argument to put across , " he conceded .
but the government should target some 300 schools that needed support , stable staffing and the sort of independent-sector smaller class sizes that chancellor gordon brown had identified in his budget speech .
" that would inspire the nation 's teachers and would have the full support of parents , " he said .
a dfes spokesman said : " academies are making big strides in a very short space of time , and we will not be distracted from giving some of the most disadvantaged children in the country the best possible education . "

city academies are a cornerstone of the government 's education reforms she said ms kelly should go beyond the new ban on admissions interviews by outlawing auditions , oral and practical tests for selection by " aptitude " .
" guaranteed fair access and an end to selection would help all of us in our joint enterprise to reduce underachievement , " she said .
" but now i truly am in the realms of fantasy , " she added .
the government 's target is to have 200 academies by 2010 .
sponsors put in £ 2m in return for control of how the school is run within national guidelines .
the government puts in typically another £ 25m of capital and pays the running costs .
earlier the nut general secretary , steve sinnott , also argued for more widespread support for struggling schools .
' popular with parents ' he told journalists the union wanted to mobilise parents against academies as well as trust schools - which enjoy some academy-like freedoms and have external partners but not the financial sponsorship .
he was asked how realistic that was when - as the government points out - academies were generally very popular with parents and their results were rising .
he said he could see the scenario where a school did not have good results , had problems and " slum buildings " .
" to say to the parents , ' we wish you to oppose having £ 30m spent on your school ' - that 's a difficult argument to put across , " he conceded .
but the government should target some 300 schools that needed support , stable staffing and the sort of independent-sector smaller class sizes that chancellor gordon brown had identified in his budget speech .
" that would inspire the nation 's teachers and would have the full support of parents , " he said .
a dfes spokesman said : " academies are making big strides in a very short space of time , and we will not be distracted from giving some of the most disadvantaged children in the country the best possible education . "

the actor has spent much of the past few years filming at sea , having starred in the 2003 blockbuster pirates of the caribbean as commodore james norrington .
davenport filmed most of mary bryant in australia he is now in the middle of filming the two sequels back-to-back , working with stars including johnny depp and keira knightley .
his experience at sea helped considerably in filming the forthcoming itv drama , but his co-star romola garai suffered for her art .
" the boat we filmed on was n't that big , " said davenport , the son of actress maria aitken and actor nigel davenport .
" it 's just completely flat on the underside , so even a 4ft wave feels like a 20ft wave because you are not cutting through the water .
" i 'm quite used to boats at the moment , i do n't get seasick but romola did , poor girl . "
filming on the incredible adventures of mary bryant was made tougher because of the extreme heat of the australian summer .
" it was n't an easy shoot .
never underestimate the heat as a factor in trying to have a coherent thought , remember dialogue and hit a mark , " said the 33-year-old star .
time pressure the actor , best known for his roles in cult tv series this life and coupling , said filming on mary bryant and pirates of the caribbean were completely different experiences - despite the similar settings .
" because it is tv , there is less time to do things and there is pressure to get things done fast , " said davenport .
filming on the mini-series was tough in the heat " and even though this was the most expensive mini-series made in australia - and this is true of everything - you always feel you could do with more money and time . "
davenport added : " the pirates films are among the most expensive ever made and you still felt you could do with more time and more money .
it 's the eternal dilemma really . "
" movies like the pirates movies are defined by set pieces - one great set piece after another . "
the second pirates film , dead man 's chest , is due to be released this summer .
sheer scale davenport believes the franchise will be the last of its kind because of the sheer scale and budget of the productions .
disney took the risk to invest millions in a film based entirely on a rollercoaster at its disneyland theme park .
it paid off when the film became a huge box office success .
" to be around at that jurassic moment is a bit of a privilege .
it 's where modern technology and old school actioneering have met , but no studio will ever go through the nail-biting terror again , " said davenport .
the actor , who rose to fame 10 years ago in this life , expresses his surprise that people still hold the tv series in such high affection , constantly asking if it will return .
this life remained a cult hit long after the series ended " we did talk about coming back .
we all met , the five from the first series and amy jenkins , the writer and producer , and we were all pretty up for it .
we would n't have careers without that show .
" but because -lrb- producer -rrb- tony garnett killed it at the moment of maximum demand , which is an incredibly talented thing to do , to find the entry point to revive it - even for an hour - without it looking a bit tacky , was too difficult . "
he added : " my favourite thing about the show was that when it ended everybody , except two characters , were miserable - and was n't that just like life ! "
in the future davenport is considering going back to the stage , but he would welcome a role in a us drama - like his current favourite shows the sopranos or curb your enthusiasm .
" i would like to have a go at american tv that was n't some network sitcom or a family drama that gets interrupted every nine seconds - so basically on job on hbo please ! "
the incredible journey of mary bryant is on itv1 on easter sunday and monday .
