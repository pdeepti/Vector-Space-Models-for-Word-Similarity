the kyoto process was designed to take some of the impact out of the climate change that many experts say is already under way . scientists say that if emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- - produced by burning fossil fuels which trap heat in the atmosphere - are not curbed , sea levels will rise and drought and floods will become more frequent , with catastrophic results . the united states , responsible for one quarter of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions , is the only g8 member not to have ratified the kyoto protocol , which sets mandatory targets for the reduction of such emissions .
canada , france , italy , japan , russia , and the uk are also members in the organization of the world 's economic powerhouses .
merkel , a former environment minister who holds a doctorate in physics , told the meeting that any efforts to stop global warming without the cooperation of " our american partners " were doomed to failure .
" that means we 've certainly got our work cut out for us - let me say that clearly . " global warming neglected by g8 agenda " to prevent global warming , the nations with the largest emissions of gases that are causing climate change have to take part , " merkel added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 28.09.2006 germany approves afghanistan mandate despite concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will continue to be deployed in the north of afghanistan germany 's mission as part of the nato-led international force in afghanistan will be extended by a year after lawmakers approved a renewed application for the bundeswehr 's mandate . after a debate in the bundestag thursday , german lawmakers agreed to extend the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan by another year despite increasing unease surrounding the safety of the troops , the deteriorating security situation and the potential overstretch of the german military . currently leading the nato mission in the relatively calm north of afghanistan , the bundeswehr reconstruction mission of 2,900 troops - almost the full quota of 3,000 soldiers set by parliament - will stay for another twelve months when the current mandate runs out in october after lawmakers voted 492 to 71 , with nine abstentions . this follows the approval of the deployment of 2,400 troops to lebanon last wednesday , a mission which makes history by taking german forces into the heart of the middle east , one of germany 's biggest post-war taboos given the country 's past with israel . despite the approval of the extended mandate , there will be no extra funding for the mission after the finance ministry rejected the demands of the defense ministry for more money to support its operations . despite reports , the bundestag ruled out sending troops to the mainly lawless south to support british , dutch and canadian forces , who are facing attacks from the resurgent taliban . there was some doubt as to whether the mandate would be extended as fears had been raised by a number of prominent german diplomats and politicians . political unease left extension in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are increasingly at risk a leaked statement from the german ambassador in kabul wednesday citing the worsening situation in the failed central asian state and similar concerns from an increasing number of politicians across the german political spectrum , was just the latest comment to put the extension doubt . hans-ulrich seidt , the german ambassador in afghanistan , was quoted in a report in the bild zeitung tabloid as saying that he was " extremely pessimistic " about the security situation in the country and that it was entirely possible that the afghan government could lose control in the next 12 to 18 months .
this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2006 consolidation race in the pharma sector gathers pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after taking over serono , german firm merck hopes to benefit from its biotech expertise the takeover of schwarz pharma by belgium 's ucb is already the fourth large merger involving german pharmaceutical firms in as many weeks .
the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .

"
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

bayern munich had no such trouble with a 2-0 away win over inter milan . bayern munich may have dealt a killer blow to inter milan 's hopes of reaching the knockout stages of the champions league after beating the italian champions 2-0 in the san siro on wednesday . meanwhile werder bremen may face a similar fate after allowing barcelona to equalize in the last minute of their champions league tie at the weserstadion . goals in the last nine minutes from peruvian international claudio pizarro and lucas podolski secured bayern 's second win in as many group b matches and left inter still looking for their first point . the serie a leaders also had zlatan ibrahimovic and italy international fabio grosso sent off as they crashed to their second successive defeat , leaving them with a mountain to climb to reach the last 16 . pizarro broke the deadlock nine minutes from time with a cool finish and a swift breakaway goal by substitute podolski sealed bayern 's first win away to italian opponents in european competition since the 1988-89 season . wednesday 's match in milan also saw the captains of both teams reach significant landmarks . stalwarts celebrate professional milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn marked his 100th game in europe for bayern inter 's argentine midfielder javier zanetti played in his 500th match for the club , while german international goalkeeper oliver kahn made his 100th champions league appearance for bayern . kahn , bayern 's hero when they won the 2001 champions league on penalties against valencia , came to his side 's rescue in the 12th minute .
inter 's serbian midfielder dejan stankovic stole possession from pizarro before sweeping the ball wide to the left wing where ibrahimovic was prowling . the giant swedish international sped towards goal but allowed the ball to run too far ahead of him , and his feeble shot was blocked by the bayern skipper . kahn 's counterpart julio cesar saved inter from falling behind in the 22nd minute .
dutch striker roy makaay escaped his marker and fired an angled shot that was heading for the corner of the net , but the brazilian keeper 's outstretched leg kept the hosts on level terms . bayern raise pace to seal late victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro got the first goal against inter milan bayern started the second half brightly with pizarro 's head an inch away from applying the finishing touch to philipp lahm 's left-wing cross . pizarro finally made the breakthrough in the 81st minute , clipping the ball past julio cesar after sneaking in unmarked behind the inter defense to latch onto roy makaay 's chipped pass . podolski netted his first goal for bayern since his summer move from fc cologne in the final minute to give the bavarian giants a 2-0 win .
the 21-year-old striker raced clear after an attempted back pass by ivan cordoba fell short before walking round julio cesar and slotting home . in bremen , werder were denied a crucial win over the holders barcelona when argentine international lionel messi scored a vital late equalizer . argentine wunderkind breaks bremen hearts barcelona looked to be heading for their first defeat in this competition for 18 months after their captain carlos puyol had scored a terrible own goal on 56 minutes . but in the 89th minute , 19-year-old substitute messi , on the pitch for just over 20 minutes , latched onto a fantastic pass from portuguese international deco to rifle in an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen gave barca a good run for their money bremen , who lost 2-0 to chelsea in their first match , have just one point to show for their efforts and could live to regret messi 's late intervention . " we are all bitterly disappointed and should not allow that to happen - particularly in the 89th minute , " said bremen goalkeeper tim wiese .
" we did enough to win but barcelona are a great team and can always create something .
messi took his goal brilliantly but the fact that it was so late on makes it even more painful . " bremen , lying a disappointing ninth in the bundesliga , were not intimidated by the champions of europe and had a good opening early on with german international torsten frings shooting inches wide of the post after a mix-up in the barcelona backline . off-color barca snatch late parity the game ebbed and flowed with the spanish champions spreading the ball around with real panache but , while it was pleasing on the eye , the usual cutting edge was missing . cameroon international striker samuel eto 'o spurned barca 's best , and only , real chance of a below-par first half with wiese using his legs to block his goal bound shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona could n't find their finesse against werder at the start of the second half the spanish visitors pushed on but bremen took the lead in the 56th minute with barcelona skipper puyol putting through his own net . aaron hunt crossed from the right and spanish international puyol got his clearance all wrong as the ball squirmed off his shin and past goalkeeper victor valdes . tim borowski went centimeters from adding a second for the hosts ten minutes later with his shot flashing across valdes ' goal . bremen looked to have done enough for a historic win but then messi popped up at the death to salvage a point for the holders . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen and bayern take on european big guns bayern munich and werder bremen face another tough night of european action wednesday as germany 's champions league representatives take on inter milan and barcelona respectively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2006 consolidation race in the pharma sector gathers pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after taking over serono , german firm merck hopes to benefit from its biotech expertise the takeover of schwarz pharma by belgium 's ucb is already the fourth large merger involving german pharmaceutical firms in as many weeks .
the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

bayern munich had no such trouble with a 2-0 away win over inter milan . bayern munich may have dealt a killer blow to inter milan 's hopes of reaching the knockout stages of the champions league after beating the italian champions 2-0 in the san siro on wednesday . meanwhile werder bremen may face a similar fate after allowing barcelona to equalize in the last minute of their champions league tie at the weserstadion . goals in the last nine minutes from peruvian international claudio pizarro and lucas podolski secured bayern 's second win in as many group b matches and left inter still looking for their first point . the serie a leaders also had zlatan ibrahimovic and italy international fabio grosso sent off as they crashed to their second successive defeat , leaving them with a mountain to climb to reach the last 16 . pizarro broke the deadlock nine minutes from time with a cool finish and a swift breakaway goal by substitute podolski sealed bayern 's first win away to italian opponents in european competition since the 1988-89 season . wednesday 's match in milan also saw the captains of both teams reach significant landmarks . stalwarts celebrate professional milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn marked his 100th game in europe for bayern inter 's argentine midfielder javier zanetti played in his 500th match for the club , while german international goalkeeper oliver kahn made his 100th champions league appearance for bayern . kahn , bayern 's hero when they won the 2001 champions league on penalties against valencia , came to his side 's rescue in the 12th minute .
inter 's serbian midfielder dejan stankovic stole possession from pizarro before sweeping the ball wide to the left wing where ibrahimovic was prowling . the giant swedish international sped towards goal but allowed the ball to run too far ahead of him , and his feeble shot was blocked by the bayern skipper . kahn 's counterpart julio cesar saved inter from falling behind in the 22nd minute .
dutch striker roy makaay escaped his marker and fired an angled shot that was heading for the corner of the net , but the brazilian keeper 's outstretched leg kept the hosts on level terms . bayern raise pace to seal late victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro got the first goal against inter milan bayern started the second half brightly with pizarro 's head an inch away from applying the finishing touch to philipp lahm 's left-wing cross . pizarro finally made the breakthrough in the 81st minute , clipping the ball past julio cesar after sneaking in unmarked behind the inter defense to latch onto roy makaay 's chipped pass . podolski netted his first goal for bayern since his summer move from fc cologne in the final minute to give the bavarian giants a 2-0 win .
the 21-year-old striker raced clear after an attempted back pass by ivan cordoba fell short before walking round julio cesar and slotting home . in bremen , werder were denied a crucial win over the holders barcelona when argentine international lionel messi scored a vital late equalizer . argentine wunderkind breaks bremen hearts barcelona looked to be heading for their first defeat in this competition for 18 months after their captain carlos puyol had scored a terrible own goal on 56 minutes . but in the 89th minute , 19-year-old substitute messi , on the pitch for just over 20 minutes , latched onto a fantastic pass from portuguese international deco to rifle in an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen gave barca a good run for their money bremen , who lost 2-0 to chelsea in their first match , have just one point to show for their efforts and could live to regret messi 's late intervention . " we are all bitterly disappointed and should not allow that to happen - particularly in the 89th minute , " said bremen goalkeeper tim wiese .
" we did enough to win but barcelona are a great team and can always create something .
messi took his goal brilliantly but the fact that it was so late on makes it even more painful . " bremen , lying a disappointing ninth in the bundesliga , were not intimidated by the champions of europe and had a good opening early on with german international torsten frings shooting inches wide of the post after a mix-up in the barcelona backline . off-color barca snatch late parity the game ebbed and flowed with the spanish champions spreading the ball around with real panache but , while it was pleasing on the eye , the usual cutting edge was missing . cameroon international striker samuel eto 'o spurned barca 's best , and only , real chance of a below-par first half with wiese using his legs to block his goal bound shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona could n't find their finesse against werder at the start of the second half the spanish visitors pushed on but bremen took the lead in the 56th minute with barcelona skipper puyol putting through his own net . aaron hunt crossed from the right and spanish international puyol got his clearance all wrong as the ball squirmed off his shin and past goalkeeper victor valdes . tim borowski went centimeters from adding a second for the hosts ten minutes later with his shot flashing across valdes ' goal . bremen looked to have done enough for a historic win but then messi popped up at the death to salvage a point for the holders . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen and bayern take on european big guns bayern munich and werder bremen face another tough night of european action wednesday as germany 's champions league representatives take on inter milan and barcelona respectively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2006 consolidation race in the pharma sector gathers pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after taking over serono , german firm merck hopes to benefit from its biotech expertise the takeover of schwarz pharma by belgium 's ucb is already the fourth large merger involving german pharmaceutical firms in as many weeks .
the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2006 consolidation race in the pharma sector gathers pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after taking over serono , german firm merck hopes to benefit from its biotech expertise the takeover of schwarz pharma by belgium 's ucb is already the fourth large merger involving german pharmaceutical firms in as many weeks .
the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects .

" many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2006 merkel to target climate change as g8 , eu leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to return green issues to the g8 and eu 's agenda next year germany will take the reins of both the g8 and the european union next year and angela merkel has made battling climate change her top priority .
but the chancellor will face the tough task of bringing the us in line . german chancellor angela merkel named confronting climate change as her country 's top priority as leader of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- nations next year and will also use germany 's weight as president of the eu to push for the reduction of energy use at the same time . germany 's dual role as head of two of the most powerful international bodies in 2007 gives merkel the opportunity to mount international efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and put global warming back on the agenda after russia played down the issue during its g8 presidency in 2006 . merkel seemed ready to face the world 's biggest polluters when she made her statements earlier this week to a meeting of conservationists in berlin and did n't need to name names when she said that her goal was to " convert the big emitters -lrb- of carbon dioxide -rrb- . " merkel faces test to get us into line that and the announcement that the g8 under germany 's leadership would face the challenge of climate change amounted to an indirect call for the united states to join in the so-called kyoto process .
the kyoto process was designed to take some of the impact out of the climate change that many experts say is already under way . scientists say that if emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- - produced by burning fossil fuels which trap heat in the atmosphere - are not curbed , sea levels will rise and drought and floods will become more frequent , with catastrophic results . the united states , responsible for one quarter of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions , is the only g8 member not to have ratified the kyoto protocol , which sets mandatory targets for the reduction of such emissions .
canada , france , italy , japan , russia , and the uk are also members in the organization of the world 's economic powerhouses .
merkel , a former environment minister who holds a doctorate in physics , told the meeting that any efforts to stop global warming without the cooperation of " our american partners " were doomed to failure .
" that means we 've certainly got our work cut out for us - let me say that clearly . " global warming neglected by g8 agenda " to prevent global warming , the nations with the largest emissions of gases that are causing climate change have to take part , " merkel added .
" that 's why we will make this an important issue once again on the agenda during our g8 presidency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gases are causing global warming " china , india and other countries are now much more aware of the risks , " she said .
" as a result , the ground is now more fertile than it once was . "
" we urgently need agreements for the period after 2012 when the kyoto protocol expires .
germany will do all it can within its realm as president of both the g8 and the eu ...
we have a great chance next year to have an international impact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2006 consolidation race in the pharma sector gathers pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after taking over serono , german firm merck hopes to benefit from its biotech expertise the takeover of schwarz pharma by belgium 's ucb is already the fourth large merger involving german pharmaceutical firms in as many weeks .
the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2006 merkel to target climate change as g8 , eu leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to return green issues to the g8 and eu 's agenda next year germany will take the reins of both the g8 and the european union next year and angela merkel has made battling climate change her top priority .
but the chancellor will face the tough task of bringing the us in line . german chancellor angela merkel named confronting climate change as her country 's top priority as leader of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- nations next year and will also use germany 's weight as president of the eu to push for the reduction of energy use at the same time . germany 's dual role as head of two of the most powerful international bodies in 2007 gives merkel the opportunity to mount international efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and put global warming back on the agenda after russia played down the issue during its g8 presidency in 2006 . merkel seemed ready to face the world 's biggest polluters when she made her statements earlier this week to a meeting of conservationists in berlin and did n't need to name names when she said that her goal was to " convert the big emitters -lrb- of carbon dioxide -rrb- . " merkel faces test to get us into line that and the announcement that the g8 under germany 's leadership would face the challenge of climate change amounted to an indirect call for the united states to join in the so-called kyoto process .
the kyoto process was designed to take some of the impact out of the climate change that many experts say is already under way . scientists say that if emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- - produced by burning fossil fuels which trap heat in the atmosphere - are not curbed , sea levels will rise and drought and floods will become more frequent , with catastrophic results . the united states , responsible for one quarter of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions , is the only g8 member not to have ratified the kyoto protocol , which sets mandatory targets for the reduction of such emissions .
canada , france , italy , japan , russia , and the uk are also members in the organization of the world 's economic powerhouses .
merkel , a former environment minister who holds a doctorate in physics , told the meeting that any efforts to stop global warming without the cooperation of " our american partners " were doomed to failure .
" that means we 've certainly got our work cut out for us - let me say that clearly . " global warming neglected by g8 agenda " to prevent global warming , the nations with the largest emissions of gases that are causing climate change have to take part , " merkel added .
" that 's why we will make this an important issue once again on the agenda during our g8 presidency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gases are causing global warming " china , india and other countries are now much more aware of the risks , " she said .
" as a result , the ground is now more fertile than it once was . "
" we urgently need agreements for the period after 2012 when the kyoto protocol expires .
germany will do all it can within its realm as president of both the g8 and the eu ...
we have a great chance next year to have an international impact . " the chancellor added that germany would continue to play a leading role in improving the efficiency of energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions on nuclear energy , climate change at g8 summit the group of eight industrial nations approved a statement on " global energy security " on sunday that allows for splits over nuclear energy and climate change among member nations .
-lrb- 16.07.2006 -rrb- germany under fire for carbon pollution give-away environmentalists are blasting a government plan to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry .

but the chancellor will face the tough task of bringing the us in line . german chancellor angela merkel named confronting climate change as her country 's top priority as leader of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- nations next year and will also use germany 's weight as president of the eu to push for the reduction of energy use at the same time . germany 's dual role as head of two of the most powerful international bodies in 2007 gives merkel the opportunity to mount international efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and put global warming back on the agenda after russia played down the issue during its g8 presidency in 2006 . merkel seemed ready to face the world 's biggest polluters when she made her statements earlier this week to a meeting of conservationists in berlin and did n't need to name names when she said that her goal was to " convert the big emitters -lrb- of carbon dioxide -rrb- . " merkel faces test to get us into line that and the announcement that the g8 under germany 's leadership would face the challenge of climate change amounted to an indirect call for the united states to join in the so-called kyoto process .
the kyoto process was designed to take some of the impact out of the climate change that many experts say is already under way . scientists say that if emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- - produced by burning fossil fuels which trap heat in the atmosphere - are not curbed , sea levels will rise and drought and floods will become more frequent , with catastrophic results . the united states , responsible for one quarter of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions , is the only g8 member not to have ratified the kyoto protocol , which sets mandatory targets for the reduction of such emissions .
canada , france , italy , japan , russia , and the uk are also members in the organization of the world 's economic powerhouses .
merkel , a former environment minister who holds a doctorate in physics , told the meeting that any efforts to stop global warming without the cooperation of " our american partners " were doomed to failure .
" that means we 've certainly got our work cut out for us - let me say that clearly . " global warming neglected by g8 agenda " to prevent global warming , the nations with the largest emissions of gases that are causing climate change have to take part , " merkel added .
" that 's why we will make this an important issue once again on the agenda during our g8 presidency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gases are causing global warming " china , india and other countries are now much more aware of the risks , " she said .
" as a result , the ground is now more fertile than it once was . "
" we urgently need agreements for the period after 2012 when the kyoto protocol expires .
germany will do all it can within its realm as president of both the g8 and the eu ...

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

bayern munich had no such trouble with a 2-0 away win over inter milan . bayern munich may have dealt a killer blow to inter milan 's hopes of reaching the knockout stages of the champions league after beating the italian champions 2-0 in the san siro on wednesday . meanwhile werder bremen may face a similar fate after allowing barcelona to equalize in the last minute of their champions league tie at the weserstadion . goals in the last nine minutes from peruvian international claudio pizarro and lucas podolski secured bayern 's second win in as many group b matches and left inter still looking for their first point . the serie a leaders also had zlatan ibrahimovic and italy international fabio grosso sent off as they crashed to their second successive defeat , leaving them with a mountain to climb to reach the last 16 . pizarro broke the deadlock nine minutes from time with a cool finish and a swift breakaway goal by substitute podolski sealed bayern 's first win away to italian opponents in european competition since the 1988-89 season . wednesday 's match in milan also saw the captains of both teams reach significant landmarks . stalwarts celebrate professional milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn marked his 100th game in europe for bayern inter 's argentine midfielder javier zanetti played in his 500th match for the club , while german international goalkeeper oliver kahn made his 100th champions league appearance for bayern . kahn , bayern 's hero when they won the 2001 champions league on penalties against valencia , came to his side 's rescue in the 12th minute .
inter 's serbian midfielder dejan stankovic stole possession from pizarro before sweeping the ball wide to the left wing where ibrahimovic was prowling . the giant swedish international sped towards goal but allowed the ball to run too far ahead of him , and his feeble shot was blocked by the bayern skipper . kahn 's counterpart julio cesar saved inter from falling behind in the 22nd minute .
dutch striker roy makaay escaped his marker and fired an angled shot that was heading for the corner of the net , but the brazilian keeper 's outstretched leg kept the hosts on level terms . bayern raise pace to seal late victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro got the first goal against inter milan bayern started the second half brightly with pizarro 's head an inch away from applying the finishing touch to philipp lahm 's left-wing cross . pizarro finally made the breakthrough in the 81st minute , clipping the ball past julio cesar after sneaking in unmarked behind the inter defense to latch onto roy makaay 's chipped pass . podolski netted his first goal for bayern since his summer move from fc cologne in the final minute to give the bavarian giants a 2-0 win .
the 21-year-old striker raced clear after an attempted back pass by ivan cordoba fell short before walking round julio cesar and slotting home . in bremen , werder were denied a crucial win over the holders barcelona when argentine international lionel messi scored a vital late equalizer . argentine wunderkind breaks bremen hearts barcelona looked to be heading for their first defeat in this competition for 18 months after their captain carlos puyol had scored a terrible own goal on 56 minutes . but in the 89th minute , 19-year-old substitute messi , on the pitch for just over 20 minutes , latched onto a fantastic pass from portuguese international deco to rifle in an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen gave barca a good run for their money bremen , who lost 2-0 to chelsea in their first match , have just one point to show for their efforts and could live to regret messi 's late intervention . " we are all bitterly disappointed and should not allow that to happen - particularly in the 89th minute , " said bremen goalkeeper tim wiese .
" we did enough to win but barcelona are a great team and can always create something .
messi took his goal brilliantly but the fact that it was so late on makes it even more painful . " bremen , lying a disappointing ninth in the bundesliga , were not intimidated by the champions of europe and had a good opening early on with german international torsten frings shooting inches wide of the post after a mix-up in the barcelona backline . off-color barca snatch late parity the game ebbed and flowed with the spanish champions spreading the ball around with real panache but , while it was pleasing on the eye , the usual cutting edge was missing . cameroon international striker samuel eto 'o spurned barca 's best , and only , real chance of a below-par first half with wiese using his legs to block his goal bound shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona could n't find their finesse against werder at the start of the second half the spanish visitors pushed on but bremen took the lead in the 56th minute with barcelona skipper puyol putting through his own net . aaron hunt crossed from the right and spanish international puyol got his clearance all wrong as the ball squirmed off his shin and past goalkeeper victor valdes . tim borowski went centimeters from adding a second for the hosts ten minutes later with his shot flashing across valdes ' goal . bremen looked to have done enough for a historic win but then messi popped up at the death to salvage a point for the holders . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen and bayern take on european big guns bayern munich and werder bremen face another tough night of european action wednesday as germany 's champions league representatives take on inter milan and barcelona respectively .

bayern munich had no such trouble with a 2-0 away win over inter milan . bayern munich may have dealt a killer blow to inter milan 's hopes of reaching the knockout stages of the champions league after beating the italian champions 2-0 in the san siro on wednesday . meanwhile werder bremen may face a similar fate after allowing barcelona to equalize in the last minute of their champions league tie at the weserstadion . goals in the last nine minutes from peruvian international claudio pizarro and lucas podolski secured bayern 's second win in as many group b matches and left inter still looking for their first point . the serie a leaders also had zlatan ibrahimovic and italy international fabio grosso sent off as they crashed to their second successive defeat , leaving them with a mountain to climb to reach the last 16 . pizarro broke the deadlock nine minutes from time with a cool finish and a swift breakaway goal by substitute podolski sealed bayern 's first win away to italian opponents in european competition since the 1988-89 season . wednesday 's match in milan also saw the captains of both teams reach significant landmarks . stalwarts celebrate professional milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn marked his 100th game in europe for bayern inter 's argentine midfielder javier zanetti played in his 500th match for the club , while german international goalkeeper oliver kahn made his 100th champions league appearance for bayern . kahn , bayern 's hero when they won the 2001 champions league on penalties against valencia , came to his side 's rescue in the 12th minute .
inter 's serbian midfielder dejan stankovic stole possession from pizarro before sweeping the ball wide to the left wing where ibrahimovic was prowling . the giant swedish international sped towards goal but allowed the ball to run too far ahead of him , and his feeble shot was blocked by the bayern skipper . kahn 's counterpart julio cesar saved inter from falling behind in the 22nd minute .
dutch striker roy makaay escaped his marker and fired an angled shot that was heading for the corner of the net , but the brazilian keeper 's outstretched leg kept the hosts on level terms . bayern raise pace to seal late victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro got the first goal against inter milan bayern started the second half brightly with pizarro 's head an inch away from applying the finishing touch to philipp lahm 's left-wing cross . pizarro finally made the breakthrough in the 81st minute , clipping the ball past julio cesar after sneaking in unmarked behind the inter defense to latch onto roy makaay 's chipped pass . podolski netted his first goal for bayern since his summer move from fc cologne in the final minute to give the bavarian giants a 2-0 win .
the 21-year-old striker raced clear after an attempted back pass by ivan cordoba fell short before walking round julio cesar and slotting home . in bremen , werder were denied a crucial win over the holders barcelona when argentine international lionel messi scored a vital late equalizer . argentine wunderkind breaks bremen hearts barcelona looked to be heading for their first defeat in this competition for 18 months after their captain carlos puyol had scored a terrible own goal on 56 minutes . but in the 89th minute , 19-year-old substitute messi , on the pitch for just over 20 minutes , latched onto a fantastic pass from portuguese international deco to rifle in an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen gave barca a good run for their money bremen , who lost 2-0 to chelsea in their first match , have just one point to show for their efforts and could live to regret messi 's late intervention . " we are all bitterly disappointed and should not allow that to happen - particularly in the 89th minute , " said bremen goalkeeper tim wiese .
" we did enough to win but barcelona are a great team and can always create something .
messi took his goal brilliantly but the fact that it was so late on makes it even more painful . " bremen , lying a disappointing ninth in the bundesliga , were not intimidated by the champions of europe and had a good opening early on with german international torsten frings shooting inches wide of the post after a mix-up in the barcelona backline . off-color barca snatch late parity the game ebbed and flowed with the spanish champions spreading the ball around with real panache but , while it was pleasing on the eye , the usual cutting edge was missing . cameroon international striker samuel eto 'o spurned barca 's best , and only , real chance of a below-par first half with wiese using his legs to block his goal bound shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona could n't find their finesse against werder at the start of the second half the spanish visitors pushed on but bremen took the lead in the 56th minute with barcelona skipper puyol putting through his own net . aaron hunt crossed from the right and spanish international puyol got his clearance all wrong as the ball squirmed off his shin and past goalkeeper victor valdes . tim borowski went centimeters from adding a second for the hosts ten minutes later with his shot flashing across valdes ' goal . bremen looked to have done enough for a historic win but then messi popped up at the death to salvage a point for the holders . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen and bayern take on european big guns bayern munich and werder bremen face another tough night of european action wednesday as germany 's champions league representatives take on inter milan and barcelona respectively .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 28.09.2006 germany approves afghanistan mandate despite concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops will continue to be deployed in the north of afghanistan germany 's mission as part of the nato-led international force in afghanistan will be extended by a year after lawmakers approved a renewed application for the bundeswehr 's mandate . after a debate in the bundestag thursday , german lawmakers agreed to extend the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan by another year despite increasing unease surrounding the safety of the troops , the deteriorating security situation and the potential overstretch of the german military . currently leading the nato mission in the relatively calm north of afghanistan , the bundeswehr reconstruction mission of 2,900 troops - almost the full quota of 3,000 soldiers set by parliament - will stay for another twelve months when the current mandate runs out in october after lawmakers voted 492 to 71 , with nine abstentions . this follows the approval of the deployment of 2,400 troops to lebanon last wednesday , a mission which makes history by taking german forces into the heart of the middle east , one of germany 's biggest post-war taboos given the country 's past with israel . despite the approval of the extended mandate , there will be no extra funding for the mission after the finance ministry rejected the demands of the defense ministry for more money to support its operations . despite reports , the bundestag ruled out sending troops to the mainly lawless south to support british , dutch and canadian forces , who are facing attacks from the resurgent taliban . there was some doubt as to whether the mandate would be extended as fears had been raised by a number of prominent german diplomats and politicians . political unease left extension in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are increasingly at risk a leaked statement from the german ambassador in kabul wednesday citing the worsening situation in the failed central asian state and similar concerns from an increasing number of politicians across the german political spectrum , was just the latest comment to put the extension doubt . hans-ulrich seidt , the german ambassador in afghanistan , was quoted in a report in the bild zeitung tabloid as saying that he was " extremely pessimistic " about the security situation in the country and that it was entirely possible that the afghan government could lose control in the next 12 to 18 months .
this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

" we have been able to arrive at some positive conclusions .
today we have discussed modalities with the aim of coming back to the main negotiations as soon as possible . " solana also said progress had been made and added that he would be speaking again to larijani next week . " we have been progressing , " solana said .
" we will have a new contact in the middle of next week . " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said the contact could take place over the phone and did not necessarily mean they would be meeting face to face . european diplomats had portrayed the talks here as a last opportunity for iran to agree to un security council demands to suspend uranium enrichment activities and thus stave off the threat of united nations sanctions . larijani also held talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at solana 's request but no details emerged . defiant president meanwhile a defiant president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed iran 's stance on its nuclear program was unyielding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad " the iranian nation will not bend one inch against any -lrb- international -rrb- force and pressure , " he told supporters in a speech in the city of karaj just outside tehran broadcast on state television .
ahmadinejad said that world powers had been seeking to impose unjust conditions on iran 's enrichment of uranium , a sensitive process that the west wants the islamic republic to suspend . iran defied the security council 's aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 28.09.2006 merkel to target climate change as g8 , eu leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to return green issues to the g8 and eu 's agenda next year germany will take the reins of both the g8 and the european union next year and angela merkel has made battling climate change her top priority .
but the chancellor will face the tough task of bringing the us in line . german chancellor angela merkel named confronting climate change as her country 's top priority as leader of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- nations next year and will also use germany 's weight as president of the eu to push for the reduction of energy use at the same time . germany 's dual role as head of two of the most powerful international bodies in 2007 gives merkel the opportunity to mount international efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and put global warming back on the agenda after russia played down the issue during its g8 presidency in 2006 . merkel seemed ready to face the world 's biggest polluters when she made her statements earlier this week to a meeting of conservationists in berlin and did n't need to name names when she said that her goal was to " convert the big emitters -lrb- of carbon dioxide -rrb- . " merkel faces test to get us into line that and the announcement that the g8 under germany 's leadership would face the challenge of climate change amounted to an indirect call for the united states to join in the so-called kyoto process .
the kyoto process was designed to take some of the impact out of the climate change that many experts say is already under way . scientists say that if emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- - produced by burning fossil fuels which trap heat in the atmosphere - are not curbed , sea levels will rise and drought and floods will become more frequent , with catastrophic results . the united states , responsible for one quarter of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions , is the only g8 member not to have ratified the kyoto protocol , which sets mandatory targets for the reduction of such emissions .
canada , france , italy , japan , russia , and the uk are also members in the organization of the world 's economic powerhouses .
merkel , a former environment minister who holds a doctorate in physics , told the meeting that any efforts to stop global warming without the cooperation of " our american partners " were doomed to failure .
" that means we 've certainly got our work cut out for us - let me say that clearly . " global warming neglected by g8 agenda " to prevent global warming , the nations with the largest emissions of gases that are causing climate change have to take part , " merkel added .
" that 's why we will make this an important issue once again on the agenda during our g8 presidency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gases are causing global warming " china , india and other countries are now much more aware of the risks , " she said .
" as a result , the ground is now more fertile than it once was . "
" we urgently need agreements for the period after 2012 when the kyoto protocol expires .
germany will do all it can within its realm as president of both the g8 and the eu ...
we have a great chance next year to have an international impact . " the chancellor added that germany would continue to play a leading role in improving the efficiency of energy use . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de divisions on nuclear energy , climate change at g8 summit the group of eight industrial nations approved a statement on " global energy security " on sunday that allows for splits over nuclear energy and climate change among member nations .
-lrb- 16.07.2006 -rrb- germany under fire for carbon pollution give-away environmentalists are blasting a government plan to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry .
the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn .
-lrb- 29.06.2006 -rrb- study says most of europe set to miss kyoto goals most of europe , which has criticized the united states over its stance on global warming , looks set to miss a set of goals to cut greenhouse gases under the kyoto protocol , a new study shows .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .

canada , france , italy , japan , russia , and the uk are also members in the organization of the world 's economic powerhouses .
merkel , a former environment minister who holds a doctorate in physics , told the meeting that any efforts to stop global warming without the cooperation of " our american partners " were doomed to failure .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

but the chancellor will face the tough task of bringing the us in line . german chancellor angela merkel named confronting climate change as her country 's top priority as leader of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- nations next year and will also use germany 's weight as president of the eu to push for the reduction of energy use at the same time . germany 's dual role as head of two of the most powerful international bodies in 2007 gives merkel the opportunity to mount international efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and put global warming back on the agenda after russia played down the issue during its g8 presidency in 2006 . merkel seemed ready to face the world 's biggest polluters when she made her statements earlier this week to a meeting of conservationists in berlin and did n't need to name names when she said that her goal was to " convert the big emitters -lrb- of carbon dioxide -rrb- . " merkel faces test to get us into line that and the announcement that the g8 under germany 's leadership would face the challenge of climate change amounted to an indirect call for the united states to join in the so-called kyoto process .
the kyoto process was designed to take some of the impact out of the climate change that many experts say is already under way . scientists say that if emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- - produced by burning fossil fuels which trap heat in the atmosphere - are not curbed , sea levels will rise and drought and floods will become more frequent , with catastrophic results . the united states , responsible for one quarter of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions , is the only g8 member not to have ratified the kyoto protocol , which sets mandatory targets for the reduction of such emissions .
canada , france , italy , japan , russia , and the uk are also members in the organization of the world 's economic powerhouses .
merkel , a former environment minister who holds a doctorate in physics , told the meeting that any efforts to stop global warming without the cooperation of " our american partners " were doomed to failure .
" that means we 've certainly got our work cut out for us - let me say that clearly . " global warming neglected by g8 agenda " to prevent global warming , the nations with the largest emissions of gases that are causing climate change have to take part , " merkel added .
" that 's why we will make this an important issue once again on the agenda during our g8 presidency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gases are causing global warming " china , india and other countries are now much more aware of the risks , " she said .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .

but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

" we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2006 consolidation race in the pharma sector gathers pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after taking over serono , german firm merck hopes to benefit from its biotech expertise the takeover of schwarz pharma by belgium 's ucb is already the fourth large merger involving german pharmaceutical firms in as many weeks .
the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .
while that gives more weight to the forecast of a future industry run by a powerful few , it also shows that there are still a lot of smaller companies out there ripe for picking .

inter 's serbian midfielder dejan stankovic stole possession from pizarro before sweeping the ball wide to the left wing where ibrahimovic was prowling . the giant swedish international sped towards goal but allowed the ball to run too far ahead of him , and his feeble shot was blocked by the bayern skipper . kahn 's counterpart julio cesar saved inter from falling behind in the 22nd minute .

the 21-year-old striker raced clear after an attempted back pass by ivan cordoba fell short before walking round julio cesar and slotting home . in bremen , werder were denied a crucial win over the holders barcelona when argentine international lionel messi scored a vital late equalizer . argentine wunderkind breaks bremen hearts barcelona looked to be heading for their first defeat in this competition for 18 months after their captain carlos puyol had scored a terrible own goal on 56 minutes . but in the 89th minute , 19-year-old substitute messi , on the pitch for just over 20 minutes , latched onto a fantastic pass from portuguese international deco to rifle in an equalizer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen gave barca a good run for their money bremen , who lost 2-0 to chelsea in their first match , have just one point to show for their efforts and could live to regret messi 's late intervention . " we are all bitterly disappointed and should not allow that to happen - particularly in the 89th minute , " said bremen goalkeeper tim wiese .
" we did enough to win but barcelona are a great team and can always create something .
messi took his goal brilliantly but the fact that it was so late on makes it even more painful . " bremen , lying a disappointing ninth in the bundesliga , were not intimidated by the champions of europe and had a good opening early on with german international torsten frings shooting inches wide of the post after a mix-up in the barcelona backline . off-color barca snatch late parity the game ebbed and flowed with the spanish champions spreading the ball around with real panache but , while it was pleasing on the eye , the usual cutting edge was missing . cameroon international striker samuel eto 'o spurned barca 's best , and only , real chance of a below-par first half with wiese using his legs to block his goal bound shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona could n't find their finesse against werder at the start of the second half the spanish visitors pushed on but bremen took the lead in the 56th minute with barcelona skipper puyol putting through his own net . aaron hunt crossed from the right and spanish international puyol got his clearance all wrong as the ball squirmed off his shin and past goalkeeper victor valdes . tim borowski went centimeters from adding a second for the hosts ten minutes later with his shot flashing across valdes ' goal . bremen looked to have done enough for a historic win but then messi popped up at the death to salvage a point for the holders . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen and bayern take on european big guns bayern munich and werder bremen face another tough night of european action wednesday as germany 's champions league representatives take on inter milan and barcelona respectively .

it is an insult for the victims , " said bakira hasecic , who heads a victims association called women - victims of war . in 1992 hasecic was raped by bosnian serb troops and expelled from visegrad , one of the towns featured in the indictment against krajisnik . the judges said krajisnik had played a " crucial " role in this campaign of " ethnic cleansing " or forced expulsion . sulejman tihic , the muslim chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , said the verdict " partially served justice . " " i hope that the prosecutor will appeal the verdict and that krajisnik will be found guilty of genocide in a final judgment , " said tihic , who went through serbian-run detention camps during the war . two masterminds at large bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masterminds karadzic and mladic are still at large the prosecution had asked for a life sentence for krajisnik .
anton nikiforov , the prosecution 's spokesman , told afp they would study the verdict before deciding if they would appeal . krajisnik maintained his innocence throughout the trial and said he was not aware that any crimes had been committed .
his defense had asked for acquittal on all charges . his brother mirko told journalists outside the tribunal that the defense would launch an appeal . radovan karadzic and his wartime military commander ratko mladic - the two alleged masterminds of the bosnian serb campaign of " ethnic cleansing " - are still on the run . they face charges including genocide over the 1995 massacre of nearly 8,000 muslim men and boys at the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu welcomes serbia war crimes action plan , awaits results the european union has welcomed a serbian " action plan " to achieve full cooperation with un prosecutors seeking to try war crimes suspect ratko mladic and urged belgrade to put it into practice .

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .
rising research costs have been hitting the smaller companies hard and the larger firms have been swooping to absorb them into their empires . the rate of consolidation has speeded up since may this year , when schering was taken over by bayer in a 17-billion-euro -lrb- $ 21.7-billion -rrb- tie-up . last week , merck , which also bid unsuccessfully for berlin-based schering earlier this year , announced that it was buying switzerland 's serono for 16.6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 10.5 billion euros , $ 13.4 billion -rrb- .
in the same week , altana last week signed off on a 4.5 billion euro deal to sell its drug business to danish pharma group nycomed . then monday saw belgian biopharmaceutical company ucb make a definite play for the monheim-based family group schwarz pharma . a landscape dominated by conglomerates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's empire expanded with the schering deal the speed at which the consolidation has picked up in recent weeks has taken the industry be surprise despite past forecasts that the pharmaceutical industry was looking at a future landscape dominated by conglomerates . " many enterprises are under a great deal of cost pressure because the buyers , under their own pressure from health insurers , want to pay less and less for drugs , " said karl-heinz schünemann , a chemical and pharmaceutical analyst at frankfurt banking house .
" at the same time the cost of drug development goes up because of more austere safety measures . " according to the german federation of the pharmaceutical industry , german pharmaceutical firms have spent 4.5 billion euros on research purposes only last year . the fact that the sector carries huge investments without solid guarantees is one not lost on altana .
researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects . "
these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .
now ucb will profit from that , just as merck hopes to profit with the takeover of serono , europe 's biggest biotech firm . the consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry in germany and europe is just one facet of a global trend .
the top 10 pharma companies in the world control 50 percent of the global market .

the forecasted consolidation of the industry is going ahead full steam . it 's as though the whole sector has been overcome by the need to consolidate . as predicted some time ago , the european pharmaceutical sector has woken up to the fact that the amount of companies within the industry makes it unsustainable .

researchers at the german firm have failed in developing any successful drugs for the market in the past few years and the patent for the company 's best selling product , stomach drug pantoprazol , also ran out leaving altana with no other choice but to sell its pharma business to nycomed . big companies reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ucb will profit from schwarz 's distribution set-up only companies with research budgets large enough to invest in long term development , and secure enough to absorb failures and expand in the long term are likely to survive as stand alone concerns as the consolidation continues . as they absorb other companies , these pharma empires can also look forward to what schünemann calls " soft synergy effects .

these are the benefits gained from taking over a firm which struggles enough in one field to precipitate a sale but is strong enough in others to benefit the buyer . last year , schwarz put a lot of investment in the construction of its own drug distribution team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.09.2006 opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon . the groundbreaking german-muslim talks that opened on wednesday in berlin needs to answer a very important question : who in germany has the authority to represent all muslims ?
the german muslim community embarked on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , in a meeting that has an admittedly symbolic character .
nevertheless , the forum marks a turning point in the government 's dealings with its own , home-grown islam : the state is talking with the muslims rather than about them .
the " process of open dialogue " that started on wednesday between the state and the " representatives of islam " is supposed to enhance mutual consideration between the two cultures .
it is supposed to work out a basis for future cooperation in the coming two to three years . road to integration the basic question is : how do we regulate the relationship between muslims and the german state ?
the answer is by creating islamic institutions that are on equal footing with already existing religious organizations .
and because the primary goals of the conference are to better integrate muslims into society , raise their visibility and engage them more in the public discourse , then this step can be seen as a first success .
there is no " organized islam " in germany , no official representatives of all the muslims who live in this country .
that is something germans learned as the calls to muslims got louder after each attempted terror attack .
in the name of their religion , muslims were supposed to clearly distance themselves from terrorism - but exactly who were these muslims ?
the 3.2 million muslims in germany are not a homogenous bloc .
there are more than 70 muslim associations , and 2,500 mosques in the country .
the argument over the question of who should have been invited to wednesday 's talks made this problem even clearer , since those invited represent less than 15 percent of muslims living in germany today .
nevertheless , these associations went to the conference with high expectations .
last friday , they came out with a joint statement that said the most important task is to integrate islam into the german state and integrate muslims into society .
need for representatives the first goal of the conference has been reached ; that is , " making it clear to the non-muslim majority in the country that islam is a part of germany , " as interior minister wolfgang schäuble said .
the participants ' reactions to the conference were overwhelmingly positive and sophisticated .
yet they should not be deceived about the central , structural problem facing them : the state can not decide who speaks for germany 's muslims .
it is critical that the inner-islamic debate over religious associations - which tend to be conservative , and are often the puppets of islamic leaders outside of germany - be brought out into the open before they are discussed in any high-level conferences .
one long term goal for germany should be creating a culture of acceptance , which would praise the accomplishments of islamic germans .
another should be establishing equality between islam , christianity and judaism .
but a prerequisite to this is a wider inner-islamic consensus over german islam 's representation in society - with democratic german law as its base . middle east expert loay mudhoon works in dw-world.de 's arabic department . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

this , he said , would see afghanistan plunged into chaos and the isaf faced with dealing with an expanded war across the whole country . unease was also expressed not only by members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - usually germany 's conscience in foreign military matters - but also sections of the ruling coalition parties of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . cross-party concern for future of mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is slipping further into chaos with the security situation in afghanistan being described as the worst since the fall of the taliban in 2001 , the safety of the approximately 3,000 german soldiers currently deployed in the country is becoming increasingly threatened . conservative willy wimmer , assistant secretary in the defense ministry , called for a new draft for the mandate which would not commit germany 's troops to missions where they would be in danger . fellow conservative peter gauweiler from the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the application for an extension was " too risky " and that the mandate had basically failed .
" the conflict in afghanistan can not be won , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung . the spd parliamentary faction 's number two , walter kolbow , disagreed that the mission had failed but told the saarbrücker zeitung that there were concerns and that 2007 " would be a key year " in the conflict and the future of german troops in afghanistan . unofficial plans to deploy german troops south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops in the south of the country face daily threats the german government was also under pressure ahead of the parliamentary debate after the financial times deutschland quoted a leaked report that it was considering extending the bundeswehr mission in the south of afghanistan . at the moment , the focus of the mission is to rebuild infrastructure and offer support to the northern regions .
there was no official government confirmation or denial regarding the report . defense minister franz josef jung had previously rejected calls for the bundeswehr to be further deployed in the south of the country before the decision not to expand the mission was made . " the fact is we have assumed control of the north and have come to an agreement with the international community regarding that , " jung told german broadcaster zdf 's " morgenmagazin " program on thursday . " we have carried out our mission as agreed , we have made our contribution , and i think we should continue with this in the future , " he added . nato boss sees southern mission as mistake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer says germany should stay north that view was also held by nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer , who has said it would be wrong for the german contingent to move south and leave the north open .
the north , despite the reconstruction efforts of the german army , is still under threat due to its proximity to the tribal lands in the hindu kush which offer taliban and al-qaida operatives refuge .
if the bundeswehr deployed to the south it would leave a job undone and a region vulnerable , de hoop scheffer has said . jung made it clear that german forces were in afghanistan purely for reconstruction reasons and any pressure to change the mandate that would be wrong .
" people must understand that we are not there as a member of the occupying forces but are there to help in the reconstruction of the country . " nato agrees on military expansion meanwhile , nato ambassadors agreed thursday to extend military operations into eastern afghanistan by the end of the year , thereby taking responsibility for the whole country , diplomats said . " the formal decision to move to the fourth and final stage of deployment for the international security assistance force was taken without any particular problems , " at nato hq in brussels , the source said . stage three saw nato take command in july , mainly through british , dutch and canadian troops , of international operations in the taliban militia 's southern heartland around the city of kandahar and down to the pakistan border . the final phase - stage four - essentially involves transferring around 10,000 us troops from the coalition involved in operation enduring freedom to isaf control and could be completed very quickly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

scientists discovered a severe immune system reaction was triggered when mice were infected with the recreated virus .
the us team believes the extreme immune response could have provoked the body to begin killing its own cells , making the flu even deadlier .
the study , published in nature , may aid the hunt for new treatments .
the 1918 pandemic took about 50 million lives .
the host 's immune system may be overreacting and killing off too many cells dr john kash university of washington the devastating infection , which is thought to have originated in birds , left young adults worst hit .
scientists in the us have reconstructed the h1n1 virus in a bid to better understand how it became such an effective killer - and to also bolster knowledge in the face of the current h5n1 bird flu threat .
the researchers infected mice with the recreated influenza virus .
through functional genomic analysis , they discovered that the mice 's immune systems responded fiercely to the infection and remained active until the animals ' deaths several days later .
at the same time , the animals also suffered the severe lung disease that is characteristic of the virus .
understanding h5n1 dr john kash , lead author of the study and assistant professor of microbiology at the university of washington , said : " what we think is happening is that the host 's inflammatory response is being highly activated by the virus , and that response is making the virus much more damaging to the host .
" the host 's immune system may be overreacting and killing off too many cells , and that may be a key contributor to what makes this virus more pathogenic . "
dr christopher basler , a co-author from mount sinai school of medicine , new york , said : " our next step is to repeat these experiments , but deconstruct what the immune system is doing so that we can understand why it is reacting so strongly , yet failing to fight the infection . "
the researchers said understanding how the virus worked would help in the fight against influenza .
it is very important to study the 1918 flu to understand the current avian flu virus paul hunter university of east anglia dr basler said : " this could help us develop more targeted therapies to combat pathogenic infections , including different types of influenzas or perhaps avian influenza . "
paul hunter , professor of health protection from the university of east anglia , uk , said : " people who have died from the current form of bird flu have died in the same sort of fashion as the people who died during the 1918 pandemic .
it is an extraordinarily unpleasant death .
" clearly , the difference between the virus now and the one around in 1918 is that the current one has yet to develop the ability to spread swiftly from person to person .

scientists discovered a severe immune system reaction was triggered when mice were infected with the recreated virus .
the us team believes the extreme immune response could have provoked the body to begin killing its own cells , making the flu even deadlier .
the study , published in nature , may aid the hunt for new treatments .
the 1918 pandemic took about 50 million lives . "
the host 's immune system may be overreacting and killing off too many cells " dr john kash university of washington the devastating infection , which is thought to have originated in birds , left young adults worst hit .
scientists in the us have reconstructed the h1n1 virus in a bid to better understand how it became such an effective killer - and to also bolster knowledge in the face of the current h5n1 bird flu threat .
the researchers infected mice with the recreated influenza virus .
through functional genomic analysis , they discovered that the mice 's immune systems responded fiercely to the infection and remained active until the animals ' deaths several days later .
at the same time , the animals also suffered the severe lung disease that is characteristic of the virus .
understanding h5n1 dr john kash , lead author of the study and assistant professor of microbiology at the university of washington , said : " what we think is happening is that the host 's inflammatory response is being highly activated by the virus , and that response is making the virus much more damaging to the host .
" the host 's immune system may be overreacting and killing off too many cells , and that may be a key contributor to what makes this virus more pathogenic . "
dr christopher basler , a co-author from mount sinai school of medicine , new york , said : " our next step is to repeat these experiments , but deconstruct what the immune system is doing so that we can understand why it is reacting so strongly , yet failing to fight the infection . "
the researchers said understanding how the virus worked would help in the fight against influenza . "
it is very important to study the 1918 flu to understand the current avian flu virus " paul hunter university of east anglia dr basler said : " this could help us develop more targeted therapies to combat pathogenic infections , including different types of influenzas or perhaps avian influenza . "
paul hunter , professor of health protection from the university of east anglia , uk , said : " people who have died from the current form of bird flu have died in the same sort of fashion as the people who died during the 1918 pandemic .
it is an extraordinarily unpleasant death .
" clearly , the difference between the virus now and the one around in 1918 is that the current one has yet to develop the ability to spread swiftly from person to person .
" it is very important to study the 1918 flu to understand the current avian flu virus . "

the violent end to the siege in the small mountain town of bailey came after the gunman threatened to harm the two female students he was holding .
the local sheriff said the gunman had shot the hostage and then himself as police attempted to rescue the girls .
the gunman initially seized six girls , but later released four of them .
the injured girl was taken by helicopter to hospital in denver , where she later died .
the other girl was unhurt .
' tactical solution ' park county sheriff fred wegener said police had decided to storm a second-floor classroom at platte canyon high school , where the two girls were being held , after the gunman broke off negotiations .
he said the breakdown in communication came 30 minutes before a deadline the gunman had set .
" it was then decided that a tactical solution needed to be done in an effort to save the two hostages that were in the room , " mr wegener told reporters .
" officers breached the classroom with explosives and within seconds the suspect shot at entering swat -lrb- specialised response unit -rrb- officers , then shot one of the two female hostages , then shot himself . "
mr wegener said the motives of the gunman - described as being between 30 and 50 years old - were unknown .
" i do n't know the identity of the gunman .
i do n't know why he wanted to do this and hopefully the investigation will reveal who it is . "
the incident began when the man entered the school around noon -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- with a gun and a rucksack , which he claimed held an explosive device , police said .
a newspaper in park county quoted what appeared to be police radio reports .
one message described the gunman as arriving at the school with a handgun and firing a single shot when a teacher refused to do what he asked .
he then took six hostages .
negotiators later arranged the release of four of them .
columbine massacre staff and pupils were evacuated from the high school and nearby fitzsimmons middle school while a bomb squad and swat teams were deployed from neighbouring jefferson county .
the two schools have nearly 800 students between them .
it was in jefferson county in 1999 where two students killed 13 people at columbine high school before taking their own lives .

ms dunn is due to appear before the us house energy and commerce committee 's investigative subcommittee later .
in a prepared statement she is expected to name hp 's finance director as the person who instigated the inquiry .
us authorities have been investigating whether hp broke any laws during its investigation into media leaks .
in an attempt to discover which employee had leaked " confidential " reports to the press , investigators obtained the phone records and other data of journalists and hp employees without their permission .
the practice - known as " pretexting " - is a common one among private investigators but tests the limits of california state laws , as prosecutors believe it violates laws covering identity theft and unauthorised access to computer data .

in her prepared statement for the house committee , she says she was under the impression that finance chief bob wayman had given the go-ahead for the investigation .
" it was my assumption that mr wayman , having ultimate authority over all the resources involved in security and investigations , as well as having been one of the directors who felt the most strongly about the importance of controlling leaks from the board , had provided authorisation for whatever work was undertaken , " ms dunn 's statement says .
the written testimony also adds that she asked private investigator ron delia if his methods were legal and complied with hp 's " normal practices " .
" i never doubted ... that what they were doing was legal , " her statement , released by the committee 's hearing panel , adds .

the announcement , which includes scrapping coursework completely for maths , has been broadly welcomed by teaching unions in wales .
the move comes after uk education secretary alan johnson announced similar changes for england .
the assembly government said it had been working closely with the uk government over the proposals .
the changes mean coursework will have to be completed in the classroom in an attempt to clamp down on cheating and pupils receiving unfair assistance from parents and the internet .
teaching unions are generally supportive of the announcement but want to ensure it will not mean extra work for teachers .
assembly education minister jane davidson said she was committed to making sure pupils were assessed in a " fair and robust way " .
you ca n't have a system where you had different rules in coursework in england and wales jane davidson am she said : " it is really important that people do respect and reward the hard work undertaken by pupils . "
she denied being pressured into a sudden decision , saying she knew alan johnson was going to make his announcement at the labour party conference on wednesday .
" this is work we have done together because england and wales are joined together in a national qualification framework . "
coursework for maths will go from september 2007 .
however , ms davidson said coursework was an important element of some gcses .
" there are different kinds of needs in the different subjects .
in art , music , drama and pe , there 's a huge amount of coursework that has to be done and teachers were strongly in favour of keeping coursework , " she told bbc radio wales ' good morning wales .
" the issue about how we get the right supervision is a complex one .
the timetable for that will depend on negotiations with schools , local authorities and examining bodies . "
she said the fact that some areas of england used the wjec examining board meant it was vital to have uniformity .
" you ca n't have a system where you had different rules in coursework in england and wales . "
' good thing ' rhys williams from nut cymru said : " the only concern i have is about the timing .
it is a shame that jane davidson did n't announce this last week .
" on the whole teachers are in favour of coursework as it gives a child more time to investigate further , and teachers appreciate assessment .
" we need to be fair and closer supervision can only be a good thing .
" i do n't think that we face a crisis in cheating , but it 's fair and makes sense to implement this before it reaches a crisis . "
plaid cymru 's education spokeswoman janet ryder said the announcement showed jane davidson was " following the london line , rather than coming up with ideas herself " .

the wide-ranging review also said £ 1.5bn was needed to tackle a backlog in local road repairs and that cash for concessionary travel could run out .
however , it said the scottish executive performed well against most targets , although more monitoring was needed .
transport minister tavish scott said he felt the report was " very fair " .
ministers have said they are planning to tackle bottle necks and offer more public transport .
auditor general for scotland robert black said : " investment in transport is significant and growing .
have your say on scotland 's transport system " given the scale of the spending and the importance of a sound transport strategy for the economy of scotland , and also for the environment and quality of life , i am encouraging the executive to improve its monitoring and reporting of what is being delivered through the transport programme . "
the report found that an executive plan to stabilise congestion at 2001 levels by 2021 looked likely to fail - a fact which has already been admitted by ministers .
the total volume of road traffic on scotland 's roads in 2005 was 43 billion vehicle kilometres , 19 % more than in 1994 .
latest forecasts estimate the figure is likely to grow by 27 % by 2021 and an executive report earlier this year found little " buy-in " from local councils to the concept of traffic reduction .
the report said : " the executive is now considering whether to replace its traffic stabilisation aspiration with targets which better focus on the transport outcomes it wishes to see . "
if we are serious about climate change and tackling emissions then it 's the government 's job to put money into public transport tavish scott transport minister it found that the use of bus services had increased by 23 million passengers since 1999/2000 and satisfaction among travellers was high .
however , free bus travel for older people and people with disabilities , introduced in april this year , prompted financial concerns .
the report stated : " higher than expected usage of free travel may exhaust the new scheme 's budget . "
however , the executive said it believed the risk was minimal .
the report also found that the number of rail journeys on scotrail services had increased by almost half over the past decade , reaching 75.1 million in 2005/06 .
mr scott told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that the executive 's national transport strategy , which is being published later this year , would address the main concerns .
mr scott said investment in public transport was essential he said : " if we want to spend more money on public transport we need to try and hold our spending on trunk and local road maintenance .
" but i accept there will always be motorists talking about congestion , potholes and delays .
" we will never have a perfect system but we do have to provide increasingly for public transport because we have to provide choice for the motorist . "
mr scott added that the executive had spent £ 335m on trunk road maintenance in 2006-2007 compared with just £ 211m in 2002-2003 .
he accepted there was still a backlog but defended the executive 's allocation of funding .
" if we are serious about climate change and tackling emissions then it 's the government 's job to put money into public transport , " said mr scott .
scottish national party transport spokesman fergus ewing said the report showed the labour / lib dem administration had failed to spend its transport budget effectively .
road bill " the lib-lab government should be establishing more and larger park-and-ride schemes and proactively promoting home-working and flexi-working to give people the chance to avoid the rush hour , " he said .
green msp mark ballard said : " instead of investing in massive road projects like the m74 and aberdeen bypass , we should be investing in providing transport alternatives to reduce car use . "

the total volume of road traffic on scotland 's roads in 2005 was 43 billion vehicle kilometres , 19 % more than in 1994 .
latest forecasts estimate the figure is likely to grow by 27 % by 2021 and an executive report earlier this year found little " buy-in " from local councils to the concept of traffic reduction .

however , free bus travel for older people and people with disabilities , introduced in april this year , prompted financial concerns .
the report stated : " higher than expected usage of free travel may exhaust the new scheme 's budget . "
however , the executive said it believed the risk was minimal .
the report also found that the number of rail journeys on scotrail services had increased by almost half over the past decade , reaching 75.1 million in 2005/06 .
mr scott told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that the executive 's national transport strategy , which is being published later this year , would address the main concerns .
mr scott said investment in public transport was essential he said : " if we want to spend more money on public transport we need to try and hold our spending on trunk and local road maintenance .
" but i accept there will always be motorists talking about congestion , potholes and delays .
" we will never have a perfect system but we do have to provide increasingly for public transport because we have to provide choice for the motorist . "
mr scott added that the executive had spent £ 335m on trunk road maintenance in 2006-2007 compared with just £ 211m in 2002-2003 .
he accepted there was still a backlog but defended the executive 's allocation of funding .
" if we are serious about climate change and tackling emissions then it 's the government 's job to put money into public transport , " said mr scott .

scientists have shown how spiders made to scale vertical glass surfaces will secrete a fibrous " glue " to anchor themselves down and prevent a fall .
arachnids are known to use claws to negotiate difficult terrain , and they also have tiny hairs that can form weak electric attractions with a surface .
but the silk represents a previously unrecognised climbing technique , a german team tells the journal nature .
" we have discovered that the tarantula has a third attachment mechanism , which depends on fibres exuded from nozzle-like structures on its feet , " stanislav gorb , from the max planck institute for developmental biology in tubingen , and colleagues write .
" these fibrous secretions function as silken tethers and , when laid down on glass plates , appear as ' footprints ' that consist of dozens of fibres with diameters of 0.2-1.0 -lsb- millionths of a metre -rsb- . "
the team studied how zebra tarantulas -lrb- aphonopelma seemanni -rrb- from costa rica managed to hang on to vertical glass plates .
to walk up , the spiders employed their distal claws ; but to come down they oozed a silky substance from all four pairs of feet .
controlled adhesion the team believes the mechanism raises interesting questions about arachnid evolution .
generally , spiders will extrude a silk from abdominal structures known as spinnerets .
this fine thread is used in a range of activities from capturing prey to providing protective shields for developing young .
the team wonders which of the adaptations - foot silk or abdominal silk - came first ; or , indeed , if they evolved completely independently .
commenting on the research , spider expert professor fritz vollrath from oxford university , uk , said foot silk had been regarded as something of an " old wife 's tale " that no scientific team had sought to describe in detail .
" it 's incredible - just like spiderman .
if the stuff is so good he can pull a train around , how does he get it off ?
" and that 's the thing for the spiders : first they have to glue themselves down and then they have to get themselves off again .

scientists have shown how spiders made to scale vertical glass surfaces will secrete a fibrous " glue " to anchor themselves down and prevent a fall .
arachnids are known to use claws to negotiate difficult terrain , and they also have tiny hairs that can form weak electric attractions with a surface .
but the silk represents a previously unrecognised climbing technique , a german team tells the journal nature .
" we have discovered that the tarantula has a third attachment mechanism , which depends on fibres exuded from nozzle-like structures on its feet , " stanislav gorb , from the max planck institute for developmental biology in tubingen , and colleagues write .
" these fibrous secretions function as silken tethers and , when laid down on glass plates , appear as ' footprints ' that consist of dozens of fibres with diameters of 0.2-1.0 -lsb- millionths of a metre -rsb- . "
the team studied how zebra tarantulas -lrb- aphonopelma seemanni -rrb- from costa rica managed to hang on to vertical glass plates .
to walk up , the spiders employed their distal claws ; but to come down they oozed a silky substance from all four pairs of feet .
controlled adhesion the team believes the mechanism raises interesting questions about arachnid evolution .
generally , spiders will extrude a silk from abdominal structures known as spinnerets .
this fine thread is used in a range of activities from capturing prey to providing protective shields for developing young .
the team wonders which of the adaptations - foot silk or abdominal silk - came first ; or , indeed , if they evolved completely independently .
commenting on the research , spider expert professor fritz vollrath from oxford university , uk , said foot silk had been regarded as something of an " old wife 's tale " that no scientific team had sought to describe in detail .
" it 's incredible - just like spiderman .

crowe will be taking part in the unveiling of a statue in kilkee , west clare , commemorating the irish legend .
it was a friendship struck up on the set of the film , gladiator in 1999 .
harris was fond of crowe , maybe because he reminded him of his younger self .
both shared a passion for acting and for life and a rebellious streak .
limerick-born harris was everything a bad-boy hollywood star should be : a handsome , boozing , brawling , womanising , jet-setter whose moody magnificence brought glamour to even his weakest movies .
but , beyond his headline-grabbing lifestyle , he was an actor of real emotional depth , able to thrill theatre or cinema audiences alike .
harris , who starred in the field and in more recent years as the wily head of hogwarts school in harry potter and the sorcerer 's stone , died in october 2002 at the age of 72 .
he had just finished work on the second harry potter movie , chamber of secrets , when he became ill .
manuel di lucia , the project director behind the richard harris memorial committee said when he first approached crowe 's agent , he was told that he was busy filming in america .
but , through a diving friend who worked on the set of another crowe film , he made another approach .
the oscar winning actor said he would take a break from filming to come to clare for the ceremony on saturday .
he intends to sing a song he wrote , along with alan doyle , in memory of harris .
" it 's is a song called ' mr harris ' about the ghost of richard harris playing as the 16th man on the rugby field , " mr di lucia said .
mr di lucia , a cousin of hollywood actor danny devito , said limerick-born harris 's ties to the area began when he spent holidays there with his brothers during his youth .
" every time he came to kilkee he brought an air of joviality to the town , " he said .
" he was very flamboyant , very well liked by everybody . "
the statue , designed by seamus connelly , shows harris playing racquet ball .
he won a racquet-ball competition four times in a row in the west clare resort where he spent his summer holidays as a young man .
harris 's three sons are travelling from los angeles and will unveil the statue .
his three surviving brothers also plan to attend .
crowe will be arriving in ireland on friday with an entourage of about 15 people , including his wife and two children .

crowe will be taking part in the unveiling of a statue in kilkee , west clare , commemorating the irish legend .
it was a friendship struck up on the set of the film , gladiator in 1999 .
harris was fond of crowe , maybe because he reminded him of his younger self .
both shared a passion for acting and for life and a rebellious streak .
limerick-born harris was everything a bad-boy hollywood star should be : a handsome , boozing , brawling , womanising , jet-setter whose moody magnificence brought glamour to even his weakest movies .
but , beyond his headline-grabbing lifestyle , he was an actor of real emotional depth , able to thrill theatre or cinema audiences alike .
russell crowe is travelling to ireland harris , who starred in the field and in more recent years as the wily head of hogwarts school in harry potter and the sorcerer 's stone , died in october 2002 at the age of 72 .
he had just finished work on the second harry potter movie , chamber of secrets , when he became ill .
manuel di lucia , the project director behind the richard harris memorial committee said when he first approached crowe 's agent , he was told that he was busy filming in america .
but , through a diving friend who worked on the set of another crowe film , he made another approach .
the oscar winning actor said he would take a break from filming to come to clare for the ceremony on saturday .
he intends to sing a song he wrote , along with alan doyle , in memory of harris .
" it 's is a song called ' mr harris ' about the ghost of richard harris playing as the 16th man on the rugby field , " mr di lucia said .
mr di lucia , a cousin of hollywood actor danny devito , said limerick-born harris 's ties to the area began when he spent holidays there with his brothers during his youth .
richard harris as albus dumbledore " every time he came to kilkee he brought an air of joviality to the town , " he said .
" he was very flamboyant , very well liked by everybody . "
the statue , designed by seamus connelly , shows harris playing racquet ball .
he won a racquet-ball competition four times in a row in the west clare resort where he spent his summer holidays as a young man .
harris 's three sons are travelling from los angeles and will unveil the statue .
his three surviving brothers also plan to attend .
crowe will be arriving in ireland on friday with an entourage of about 15 people , including his wife and two children .

the chief inspector of prisons , anne owers , published her findings into pentonville prison following an unannounced inspection in june .
ms owers also accused the jail of " institutional disrespect " of inmates .
the prison service said pentonville 's governor was taking a robust stance in dealing with prisoner complaints .
the chief inspector 's report revealed 43 % of prisoners , down from 64 % in 2005 , said staff treated them with respect .
the pentonville of this report would be more in place in hogarth 's gin lane juliet lyon , from prison reform trust allegations of victimisation rose from 29 % to 40 % over the same period .
of 12 main recommendations made in a report last year , seven had not been achieved and another four had only partially been met .
this year 's inspection also found 55 % of prisoners said they felt unsafe and 42 % claimed it was easy to obtain drugs .
ms owers ' report also said inmates at the north london prison lacked basic requirements such as pillows , while at times there was not enough food .
she said her findings highlighted the scale of problems in " overcrowded and pressurised " local prisons .
' difficult environment ' " they -lsb- managers and staff -rsb- need to explore the reasons for the significant deterioration in staff-prisoner relationships , monitor them closely and take decisive action to investigate and deal with any allegations against staff , " she said .
" they found some improvements : prisoners were out of their cells more than they had been , " ms owers told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" but we did find a deterioration in relationships with staff .
i think what we did find was that the new management team had inherited a prison with virtually no systems for making sure that prisoners got the basics they needed , and for managing and monitoring the behaviour of some staff .
" what they were faced with is the rising prison population , the fact that they 've no headroom , the fact they 've got a hundred prisoners sometimes coming in a day .
" it 's a very difficult environment in an old building in which to try to make the kind of changes pentonville needs , " ms owers said .
pentonville has been operating under significant pressure michael spurr , from the prison service the prison was said to be " overrun with cockroaches and vermin " caused by leftover meals and flour sacks left open in the kitchen .
but a prison service spokeswoman said : " pentonville now has a pest control programme in place which includes a pest control company visiting the site on a weekly basis . "
she added that although food occasionally runs out due to poor portion control , no prisoner goes without a meal .
' not fit ' michael spurr , from the prison service , said : " we have strengthened the senior management team and the governor is taking a robust stance in dealing with allegations of inappropriate behaviour by staff .
" pentonville has been operating under significant pressure .
as the chief inspector acknowledges , it is the busiest prison in london . "
shadow home affairs minister edward garnier made a plea for proper leadership at a " strategic , political level " of the prison service .
and juliet lyon , of the prison reform trust , called for the home secretary to consider closing pentonville as it was " not fit for purpose " .
she added : " the pentonville of this report would be more in place in hogarth 's gin lane than islington today . "

i think what we did find was that the new management team had inherited a prison with virtually no systems for making sure that prisoners got the basics they needed , and for managing and monitoring the behaviour of some staff .
" what they were faced with is the rising prison population , the fact that they 've no headroom , the fact they 've got a hundred prisoners sometimes coming in a day .
" it 's a very difficult environment in an old building in which to try to make the kind of changes pentonville needs , " ms owers said . "
pentonville has been operating under significant pressure " michael spurr , from the prison service the prison was said to be " overrun with cockroaches and vermin " caused by leftover meals and flour sacks left open in the kitchen .
but a prison service spokeswoman said : " pentonville now has a pest control programme in place which includes a pest control company visiting the site on a weekly basis . "
she added that although food occasionally runs out due to poor portion control , no prisoner goes without a meal .
' not fit ' michael spurr , from the prison service , said : " we have strengthened the senior management team and the governor is taking a robust stance in dealing with allegations of inappropriate behaviour by staff .
" pentonville has been operating under significant pressure .
as the chief inspector acknowledges , it is the busiest prison in london . "
shadow home affairs minister edward garnier made a plea for proper leadership at a " strategic , political level " of the prison service .
and juliet lyon , of the prison reform trust , called for the home secretary to consider closing pentonville as it was " not fit for purpose " .
she added : " the pentonville of this report would be more in place in hogarth 's gin lane than islington today . "
