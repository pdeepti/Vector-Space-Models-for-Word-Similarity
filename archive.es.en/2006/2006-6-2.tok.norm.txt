commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .
" the neoclassical sculptures made in the united states at the time of the new deal look just like the sculptures produced in germany in the 1930s , in the soviet union , italy , or at the palais chaillot in paris . " jewish cou n cil speaks out rosh and giordano may have cause to rethink their demands following a statement issued by germany 's central council of jews on wednesday .
the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said the calls to tear down or cover up the statues were " completely out of place . " it 's " completely wrong , " to wipe away these traces of history , he said , adding that such a move would only play into the hands of those who would like to forget about the past and sweep it all under the rug . a better approach is to treat the whole complex , sculptures included , as problematic and to show " how the nazis tried to abuse images of the human body for their propaganda purposes , " kramer said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germania : visions of grandeur had hitler won the war , his plan was to transform berlin into germania - the city he planned with architect albert speer .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .
" the neoclassical sculptures made in the united states at the time of the new deal look just like the sculptures produced in germany in the 1930s , in the soviet union , italy , or at the palais chaillot in paris . " jewish cou n cil speaks out rosh and giordano may have cause to rethink their demands following a statement issued by germany 's central council of jews on wednesday .
the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said the calls to tear down or cover up the statues were " completely out of place . " it 's " completely wrong , " to wipe away these traces of history , he said , adding that such a move would only play into the hands of those who would like to forget about the past and sweep it all under the rug . a better approach is to treat the whole complex , sculptures included , as problematic and to show " how the nazis tried to abuse images of the human body for their propaganda purposes , " kramer said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germania : visions of grandeur had hitler won the war , his plan was to transform berlin into germania - the city he planned with architect albert speer .

deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .
if things go awry , europe will have embarrassed itself as a global player . andreas noll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .

" it 's clearly a slap in the face for deutsche börse , " one trader told reuters .
" however , no one seriously thought that they would have a chance with euronext .

" maybe it 's a good thing that the marriage with euronext did n't work out , " he said .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

officials declined to specify measures or label them sanctions .
but they are thought to include a range of trade , security and technology incentives as well as the threat of unspecified penalties . " we consider it a step forward in our quest to deny iran a nuclear weapons capability , " said us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns .
" we are very satisfied . " possible arms embargo a draft proposal of the text seen by afp includes helping iran build light water reactors for its civilian nuclear energy program . according to this text , possible sanctions could include an arms embargo against iran - something russia , a key arms supplier to iran , and china , a major consumer of iranian oil , resist - but that sanctions would be targeted rather than a full economic or other boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has said it wo n't cease its nuclear activities the agreement by six of the world 's most powerful nations caps months of diplomacy during which the united states has tried to meet russian and chinese demands to avoid escalating the showdown over iran 's nuclear program . after three years of a un investigation of iran 's program , a senior us state department official said tehran would be presented with the proposals within a few days and would have only " weeks " to answer . calling the proposals " far-reaching , " british foreign secretary margaret beckett urged tehran to respond positively to the benefits on offer in order to allay fears that it is seeking nuclear weapons and to avoid facing un security council punishment which could include sanctions . " the proposals offer iran a chance to reach a negotiated agreement , " she said . holding to the line one diplomat said that the powers held to the line of us secretary of state condoleezza rice that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment activities as a condition for talks to resume .
enrichment makes nuclear reactor fuel but can also be used for atom bomb material . rice had wednesday set this as a condition for washington to join european union negotiators britain , france and germany in talks with iran .
openness to such talks with iran is a major policy switch by the united states , 26 years after it broke off diplomatic relations with tehran when islamic militants took over the country . washington claims iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons under the cover of what tehran says is a peaceful effort to generate electricity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national intelligence director john negroponte says that iran could have a nuclear bomb by 2010 us officials stressed the package offered had bite , despite some diplomats saying the disincentive side had been watered down .
a us state department official said : " what we have is a commitment from our partners that if iran -lrb- does n't take the hand extended -rrb- , the security council will take the measures necessary and these measures will have teeth . " diplomats said this was designed to avoid offending iran and to draw it into negotiations , in a clear effort at more savvy public diplomacy than the confrontational mode of the past . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov early friday voiced moscow 's hope that iran would respond to the deal . " together at the negotiating table we will be able to work out a way that would allow us to ensure iran 's legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy and yet maintain the non-proliferation regime , " was quoted by the itar-tass news agency as telling russian reporters here . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe hails us offer of talks with iran on the eve of meetings over iran 's nuclear aspirations in vienna , the us offered to join direct talks for the first time .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .

it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .
-lrb- may 16 , 2006 -rrb- illegals in germany face similar problems as those in us with the status and protests of illegal immigrants in the united states making the headlines over the past days and weeks , the same question can be posed for germany : how do illegal immigrants fare in this country ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.06.2006 nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer are among the disputed works just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests . the muscle-bound supermen in bronze and stone that can be seen in and around berlin 's olympic stadium have been controversial for years .
commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .

" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .
" the neoclassical sculptures made in the united states at the time of the new deal look just like the sculptures produced in germany in the 1930s , in the soviet union , italy , or at the palais chaillot in paris . " jewish cou n cil speaks out rosh and giordano may have cause to rethink their demands following a statement issued by germany 's central council of jews on wednesday .
the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said the calls to tear down or cover up the statues were " completely out of place . " it 's " completely wrong , " to wipe away these traces of history , he said , adding that such a move would only play into the hands of those who would like to forget about the past and sweep it all under the rug . a better approach is to treat the whole complex , sculptures included , as problematic and to show " how the nazis tried to abuse images of the human body for their propaganda purposes , " kramer said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germania : visions of grandeur had hitler won the war , his plan was to transform berlin into germania - the city he planned with architect albert speer .

enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way . " gül expressed hope that germany would continue to back turkey 's membership aspirations . ankara lost a staunch supporter in germany when gerhard schröder lost in last year 's elections to incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who is cool towards turkish membership . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 opinion : eu destined for embarrassment in dr congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans soldiers will soon be carrying out their duty in dr congo germany 's parliament has agreed to help secure elections in the democratic republic of congo set for july 30 .
deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .
if things go awry , europe will have embarrassed itself as a global player . andreas noll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .
it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone .

" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone .

" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .

breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past .

deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .
if things go awry , europe will have embarrassed itself as a global player . andreas noll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .
it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2006 mcdonald 's , coke run afoul of german law with ball-bottle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are n't lovin ' the special world cup drink-ball world cup sponsors mcdonald 's and coca-cola are accused of violating german laws on drinks packaging and recycling with their special edition cola bottle in the shape of a soccer ball . given that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are two of the world cup 's top sponsors , you 'd expect them to cooperate on a promotional gimmick to exploit the situation .
enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it . " the originators of the letter and the operators of the internet page want to unnerve the population and cast the world cup in a negative light , " the statement read .
" the originators of the phony letter and the phony internet page could face criminal consequences .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies .

" nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .
-lrb- may 16 , 2006 -rrb- illegals in germany face similar problems as those in us with the status and protests of illegal immigrants in the united states making the headlines over the past days and weeks , the same question can be posed for germany : how do illegal immigrants fare in this country ?
-lrb- may 2 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett .

it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.06.2006 nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer are among the disputed works just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests . the muscle-bound supermen in bronze and stone that can be seen in and around berlin 's olympic stadium have been controversial for years .
commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone .

and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone .

" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .

breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .

" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough .

" people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .

officials declined to specify measures or label them sanctions .
but they are thought to include a range of trade , security and technology incentives as well as the threat of unspecified penalties . " we consider it a step forward in our quest to deny iran a nuclear weapons capability , " said us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns .
" we are very satisfied . " possible arms embargo a draft proposal of the text seen by afp includes helping iran build light water reactors for its civilian nuclear energy program . according to this text , possible sanctions could include an arms embargo against iran - something russia , a key arms supplier to iran , and china , a major consumer of iranian oil , resist - but that sanctions would be targeted rather than a full economic or other boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has said it wo n't cease its nuclear activities the agreement by six of the world 's most powerful nations caps months of diplomacy during which the united states has tried to meet russian and chinese demands to avoid escalating the showdown over iran 's nuclear program . after three years of a un investigation of iran 's program , a senior us state department official said tehran would be presented with the proposals within a few days and would have only " weeks " to answer . calling the proposals " far-reaching , " british foreign secretary margaret beckett urged tehran to respond positively to the benefits on offer in order to allay fears that it is seeking nuclear weapons and to avoid facing un security council punishment which could include sanctions . " the proposals offer iran a chance to reach a negotiated agreement , " she said . holding to the line one diplomat said that the powers held to the line of us secretary of state condoleezza rice that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment activities as a condition for talks to resume .
enrichment makes nuclear reactor fuel but can also be used for atom bomb material . rice had wednesday set this as a condition for washington to join european union negotiators britain , france and germany in talks with iran .
openness to such talks with iran is a major policy switch by the united states , 26 years after it broke off diplomatic relations with tehran when islamic militants took over the country . washington claims iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons under the cover of what tehran says is a peaceful effort to generate electricity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national intelligence director john negroponte says that iran could have a nuclear bomb by 2010 us officials stressed the package offered had bite , despite some diplomats saying the disincentive side had been watered down .
a us state department official said : " what we have is a commitment from our partners that if iran -lrb- does n't take the hand extended -rrb- , the security council will take the measures necessary and these measures will have teeth . " diplomats said this was designed to avoid offending iran and to draw it into negotiations , in a clear effort at more savvy public diplomacy than the confrontational mode of the past . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov early friday voiced moscow 's hope that iran would respond to the deal . " together at the negotiating table we will be able to work out a way that would allow us to ensure iran 's legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy and yet maintain the non-proliferation regime , " was quoted by the itar-tass news agency as telling russian reporters here . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe hails us offer of talks with iran on the eve of meetings over iran 's nuclear aspirations in vienna , the us offered to join direct talks for the first time .

deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .

deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way . " gül expressed hope that germany would continue to back turkey 's membership aspirations . ankara lost a staunch supporter in germany when gerhard schröder lost in last year 's elections to incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who is cool towards turkish membership . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .

it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2006 mcdonald 's , coke run afoul of german law with ball-bottle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are n't lovin ' the special world cup drink-ball world cup sponsors mcdonald 's and coca-cola are accused of violating german laws on drinks packaging and recycling with their special edition cola bottle in the shape of a soccer ball . given that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are two of the world cup 's top sponsors , you 'd expect them to cooperate on a promotional gimmick to exploit the situation .
enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it .

officials declined to specify measures or label them sanctions .
but they are thought to include a range of trade , security and technology incentives as well as the threat of unspecified penalties . " we consider it a step forward in our quest to deny iran a nuclear weapons capability , " said us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns .
" we are very satisfied . " possible arms embargo a draft proposal of the text seen by afp includes helping iran build light water reactors for its civilian nuclear energy program . according to this text , possible sanctions could include an arms embargo against iran - something russia , a key arms supplier to iran , and china , a major consumer of iranian oil , resist - but that sanctions would be targeted rather than a full economic or other boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has said it wo n't cease its nuclear activities the agreement by six of the world 's most powerful nations caps months of diplomacy during which the united states has tried to meet russian and chinese demands to avoid escalating the showdown over iran 's nuclear program . after three years of a un investigation of iran 's program , a senior us state department official said tehran would be presented with the proposals within a few days and would have only " weeks " to answer . calling the proposals " far-reaching , " british foreign secretary margaret beckett urged tehran to respond positively to the benefits on offer in order to allay fears that it is seeking nuclear weapons and to avoid facing un security council punishment which could include sanctions . " the proposals offer iran a chance to reach a negotiated agreement , " she said . holding to the line one diplomat said that the powers held to the line of us secretary of state condoleezza rice that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment activities as a condition for talks to resume .
enrichment makes nuclear reactor fuel but can also be used for atom bomb material . rice had wednesday set this as a condition for washington to join european union negotiators britain , france and germany in talks with iran .
openness to such talks with iran is a major policy switch by the united states , 26 years after it broke off diplomatic relations with tehran when islamic militants took over the country . washington claims iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons under the cover of what tehran says is a peaceful effort to generate electricity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national intelligence director john negroponte says that iran could have a nuclear bomb by 2010 us officials stressed the package offered had bite , despite some diplomats saying the disincentive side had been watered down .
a us state department official said : " what we have is a commitment from our partners that if iran -lrb- does n't take the hand extended -rrb- , the security council will take the measures necessary and these measures will have teeth . " diplomats said this was designed to avoid offending iran and to draw it into negotiations , in a clear effort at more savvy public diplomacy than the confrontational mode of the past . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov early friday voiced moscow 's hope that iran would respond to the deal . " together at the negotiating table we will be able to work out a way that would allow us to ensure iran 's legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy and yet maintain the non-proliferation regime , " was quoted by the itar-tass news agency as telling russian reporters here . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe hails us offer of talks with iran on the eve of meetings over iran 's nuclear aspirations in vienna , the us offered to join direct talks for the first time .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.06.2006 nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer are among the disputed works just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests . the muscle-bound supermen in bronze and stone that can be seen in and around berlin 's olympic stadium have been controversial for years .
commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way . " gül expressed hope that germany would continue to back turkey 's membership aspirations . ankara lost a staunch supporter in germany when gerhard schröder lost in last year 's elections to incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who is cool towards turkish membership . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .

it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it . " the originators of the letter and the operators of the internet page want to unnerve the population and cast the world cup in a negative light , " the statement read .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way . " gül expressed hope that germany would continue to back turkey 's membership aspirations . ankara lost a staunch supporter in germany when gerhard schröder lost in last year 's elections to incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who is cool towards turkish membership . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .

around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed .

officials declined to specify measures or label them sanctions .
but they are thought to include a range of trade , security and technology incentives as well as the threat of unspecified penalties . " we consider it a step forward in our quest to deny iran a nuclear weapons capability , " said us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns .
" we are very satisfied . " possible arms embargo a draft proposal of the text seen by afp includes helping iran build light water reactors for its civilian nuclear energy program . according to this text , possible sanctions could include an arms embargo against iran - something russia , a key arms supplier to iran , and china , a major consumer of iranian oil , resist - but that sanctions would be targeted rather than a full economic or other boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has said it wo n't cease its nuclear activities the agreement by six of the world 's most powerful nations caps months of diplomacy during which the united states has tried to meet russian and chinese demands to avoid escalating the showdown over iran 's nuclear program . after three years of a un investigation of iran 's program , a senior us state department official said tehran would be presented with the proposals within a few days and would have only " weeks " to answer . calling the proposals " far-reaching , " british foreign secretary margaret beckett urged tehran to respond positively to the benefits on offer in order to allay fears that it is seeking nuclear weapons and to avoid facing un security council punishment which could include sanctions . " the proposals offer iran a chance to reach a negotiated agreement , " she said . holding to the line one diplomat said that the powers held to the line of us secretary of state condoleezza rice that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment activities as a condition for talks to resume .
enrichment makes nuclear reactor fuel but can also be used for atom bomb material . rice had wednesday set this as a condition for washington to join european union negotiators britain , france and germany in talks with iran .
openness to such talks with iran is a major policy switch by the united states , 26 years after it broke off diplomatic relations with tehran when islamic militants took over the country . washington claims iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons under the cover of what tehran says is a peaceful effort to generate electricity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national intelligence director john negroponte says that iran could have a nuclear bomb by 2010 us officials stressed the package offered had bite , despite some diplomats saying the disincentive side had been watered down .
a us state department official said : " what we have is a commitment from our partners that if iran -lrb- does n't take the hand extended -rrb- , the security council will take the measures necessary and these measures will have teeth . " diplomats said this was designed to avoid offending iran and to draw it into negotiations , in a clear effort at more savvy public diplomacy than the confrontational mode of the past . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov early friday voiced moscow 's hope that iran would respond to the deal . " together at the negotiating table we will be able to work out a way that would allow us to ensure iran 's legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy and yet maintain the non-proliferation regime , " was quoted by the itar-tass news agency as telling russian reporters here . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe hails us offer of talks with iran on the eve of meetings over iran 's nuclear aspirations in vienna , the us offered to join direct talks for the first time .
but iran said thursday it wo n't accept .

no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?

kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .
" the neoclassical sculptures made in the united states at the time of the new deal look just like the sculptures produced in germany in the 1930s , in the soviet union , italy , or at the palais chaillot in paris . " jewish cou n cil speaks out rosh and giordano may have cause to rethink their demands following a statement issued by germany 's central council of jews on wednesday .
the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said the calls to tear down or cover up the statues were " completely out of place . " it 's " completely wrong , " to wipe away these traces of history , he said , adding that such a move would only play into the hands of those who would like to forget about the past and sweep it all under the rug . a better approach is to treat the whole complex , sculptures included , as problematic and to show " how the nazis tried to abuse images of the human body for their propaganda purposes , " kramer said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germania : visions of grandeur had hitler won the war , his plan was to transform berlin into germania - the city he planned with architect albert speer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 opinion : eu destined for embarrassment in dr congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans soldiers will soon be carrying out their duty in dr congo germany 's parliament has agreed to help secure elections in the democratic republic of congo set for july 30 .
deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .
if things go awry , europe will have embarrassed itself as a global player . andreas noll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .
it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years .

deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .

and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .
" the neoclassical sculptures made in the united states at the time of the new deal look just like the sculptures produced in germany in the 1930s , in the soviet union , italy , or at the palais chaillot in paris . " jewish cou n cil speaks out rosh and giordano may have cause to rethink their demands following a statement issued by germany 's central council of jews on wednesday .
the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said the calls to tear down or cover up the statues were " completely out of place . " it 's " completely wrong , " to wipe away these traces of history , he said , adding that such a move would only play into the hands of those who would like to forget about the past and sweep it all under the rug . a better approach is to treat the whole complex , sculptures included , as problematic and to show " how the nazis tried to abuse images of the human body for their propaganda purposes , " kramer said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germania : visions of grandeur had hitler won the war , his plan was to transform berlin into germania - the city he planned with architect albert speer .

" i 'm happy the transfer has been worked out , " podolski told a news conference at germany 's world cup training camp .
" i 'm looking forward to a new challenge , a new city and a new club .
bayern are the best in germany .
it 's the best address . " " bayern are number one and i want to measure myself against the best , " said the 20-year-old striker at düsseldorf 's hilton hotel after signing on the dotted line with his new employers . despite sending cologne into a period of mourning , the deal is a remarkable piece of business for the city 's soccer club .
the prince , as he was known to his adoring supporters , could have left after next season for a fixed fee of one million euros as stipulated in a clause in his last contract with the club . relegation a drop too far for ambitious poldi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second division ?
no thanks but while bayern munich won the championship at the end of this season , cologne were relegated and podolski had made it known that he did not want to miss another year in the bundesliga despite his loyalty to his home-town club .
podolski spent one season in the second division with cologne in 2004/05 .
" another year in the second division was n't acceptable for me , " he said . podolski , who turns 21 on sunday , will reportedly earn 2.5 million euros a year with his new club . cologne president wolfgang overath , while sorry to see the club 's prize possession leave , was satisfied with the conclusion of the long-running courtship .
" we are all happy with the solution , " ' he said after what he called " fair negotiations . "
with the coffers swelled with at least ten times as much as they were expecting for the young striker , he added : " we can live with the result . " " he is an outstanding footballer but still has some things to learn , " he concluded . bayern and germany happy at star 's transfer to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi is a favorite , regardless of what team he plays for the bayern hierarchy was obviously just as satisfied at getting a prodigious talent like podolski on their books .
" we are very happy and content that we were able to bring one of the most talented german internationals to bayern , " said club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge . the transfer was also welcomed by the german international set-up of which podolski has become an integral member .
germany assistant coach joachim löw said he believed the move to bayern was the correct one .
" he is an exceptional talent , " said löw .
" now he will be properly challenged , will be able to play in international competition and will have to fight for his place . " podolski will not only get the chance to test himself against the best defenses in europe as part of bayern 's champions league campaign next season but will also find competition at his new home .
he will be vying for a starting place with strikers of the caliber of roy makaay , claudio pizarro and roque santa cruz . podolski is unlikely to be fazed by such competition - such is his belief in his own ability which is backed up with hard facts .
the prince scored 22 goals in 51 top flight games for cologn , while his season in the second division saw him bag 24 goals in 30 games .
his record for the german national team is also impressive with a goal ratio of one every two matches .
he has scored 12 goals in 24 appearances to date . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hsv challenge bayern 's pulling power in pursuit of podolski germany striker lukas podolski looked destined to leave his beloved cologne for bayern munich in 2006 .

what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .

" i 'm happy the transfer has been worked out , " podolski told a news conference at germany 's world cup training camp .
" i 'm looking forward to a new challenge , a new city and a new club .
bayern are the best in germany .
it 's the best address . " " bayern are number one and i want to measure myself against the best , " said the 20-year-old striker at düsseldorf 's hilton hotel after signing on the dotted line with his new employers . despite sending cologne into a period of mourning , the deal is a remarkable piece of business for the city 's soccer club .
the prince , as he was known to his adoring supporters , could have left after next season for a fixed fee of one million euros as stipulated in a clause in his last contract with the club . relegation a drop too far for ambitious poldi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second division ?
no thanks but while bayern munich won the championship at the end of this season , cologne were relegated and podolski had made it known that he did not want to miss another year in the bundesliga despite his loyalty to his home-town club .
podolski spent one season in the second division with cologne in 2004/05 .
" another year in the second division was n't acceptable for me , " he said . podolski , who turns 21 on sunday , will reportedly earn 2.5 million euros a year with his new club . cologne president wolfgang overath , while sorry to see the club 's prize possession leave , was satisfied with the conclusion of the long-running courtship .
" we are all happy with the solution , " ' he said after what he called " fair negotiations . "
with the coffers swelled with at least ten times as much as they were expecting for the young striker , he added : " we can live with the result . " " he is an outstanding footballer but still has some things to learn , " he concluded . bayern and germany happy at star 's transfer to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi is a favorite , regardless of what team he plays for the bayern hierarchy was obviously just as satisfied at getting a prodigious talent like podolski on their books .
" we are very happy and content that we were able to bring one of the most talented german internationals to bayern , " said club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge . the transfer was also welcomed by the german international set-up of which podolski has become an integral member .
germany assistant coach joachim löw said he believed the move to bayern was the correct one .
" he is an exceptional talent , " said löw .
" now he will be properly challenged , will be able to play in international competition and will have to fight for his place . " podolski will not only get the chance to test himself against the best defenses in europe as part of bayern 's champions league campaign next season but will also find competition at his new home .
he will be vying for a starting place with strikers of the caliber of roy makaay , claudio pizarro and roque santa cruz . podolski is unlikely to be fazed by such competition - such is his belief in his own ability which is backed up with hard facts .
the prince scored 22 goals in 51 top flight games for cologn , while his season in the second division saw him bag 24 goals in 30 games .
his record for the german national team is also impressive with a goal ratio of one every two matches .

" another year in the second division was n't acceptable for me , " he said . podolski , who turns 21 on sunday , will reportedly earn 2.5 million euros a year with his new club . cologne president wolfgang overath , while sorry to see the club 's prize possession leave , was satisfied with the conclusion of the long-running courtship .
" we are all happy with the solution , " ' he said after what he called " fair negotiations . "
with the coffers swelled with at least ten times as much as they were expecting for the young striker , he added : " we can live with the result . " " he is an outstanding footballer but still has some things to learn , " he concluded . bayern and germany happy at star 's transfer to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi is a favorite , regardless of what team he plays for the bayern hierarchy was obviously just as satisfied at getting a prodigious talent like podolski on their books .
" we are very happy and content that we were able to bring one of the most talented german internationals to bayern , " said club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge . the transfer was also welcomed by the german international set-up of which podolski has become an integral member .
germany assistant coach joachim löw said he believed the move to bayern was the correct one .
" he is an exceptional talent , " said löw .
" now he will be properly challenged , will be able to play in international competition and will have to fight for his place . " podolski will not only get the chance to test himself against the best defenses in europe as part of bayern 's champions league campaign next season but will also find competition at his new home .
he will be vying for a starting place with strikers of the caliber of roy makaay , claudio pizarro and roque santa cruz . podolski is unlikely to be fazed by such competition - such is his belief in his own ability which is backed up with hard facts .
the prince scored 22 goals in 51 top flight games for cologn , while his season in the second division saw him bag 24 goals in 30 games .
his record for the german national team is also impressive with a goal ratio of one every two matches .
he has scored 12 goals in 24 appearances to date . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hsv challenge bayern 's pulling power in pursuit of podolski germany striker lukas podolski looked destined to leave his beloved cologne for bayern munich in 2006 .

paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .
if things go awry , europe will have embarrassed itself as a global player . andreas noll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .
it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years .
-lrb- june 1 , 2006 -rrb- " the un counts on europe " in dr congo albrecht conze , the political director of the un mission in the democratic republic of congo , talked to dw-world.de about the upcoming elections and the role of european troops to safeguard them .
-lrb- may 27 , 2006 -rrb- germans enjoy good reputation among congolese people in congo were happy to hear that german soldiers will be among those headed to congo as part of the eu force keeping the peace during the country 's first free elections .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

" i 'm happy the transfer has been worked out , " podolski told a news conference at germany 's world cup training camp .
" i 'm looking forward to a new challenge , a new city and a new club .
bayern are the best in germany .
it 's the best address . " " bayern are number one and i want to measure myself against the best , " said the 20-year-old striker at düsseldorf 's hilton hotel after signing on the dotted line with his new employers . despite sending cologne into a period of mourning , the deal is a remarkable piece of business for the city 's soccer club .
the prince , as he was known to his adoring supporters , could have left after next season for a fixed fee of one million euros as stipulated in a clause in his last contract with the club . relegation a drop too far for ambitious poldi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second division ?
no thanks but while bayern munich won the championship at the end of this season , cologne were relegated and podolski had made it known that he did not want to miss another year in the bundesliga despite his loyalty to his home-town club .
podolski spent one season in the second division with cologne in 2004/05 .
" another year in the second division was n't acceptable for me , " he said . podolski , who turns 21 on sunday , will reportedly earn 2.5 million euros a year with his new club . cologne president wolfgang overath , while sorry to see the club 's prize possession leave , was satisfied with the conclusion of the long-running courtship .
" we are all happy with the solution , " ' he said after what he called " fair negotiations . "
with the coffers swelled with at least ten times as much as they were expecting for the young striker , he added : " we can live with the result . " " he is an outstanding footballer but still has some things to learn , " he concluded . bayern and germany happy at star 's transfer to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi is a favorite , regardless of what team he plays for the bayern hierarchy was obviously just as satisfied at getting a prodigious talent like podolski on their books .
" we are very happy and content that we were able to bring one of the most talented german internationals to bayern , " said club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge . the transfer was also welcomed by the german international set-up of which podolski has become an integral member .
germany assistant coach joachim löw said he believed the move to bayern was the correct one .
" he is an exceptional talent , " said löw .
" now he will be properly challenged , will be able to play in international competition and will have to fight for his place . " podolski will not only get the chance to test himself against the best defenses in europe as part of bayern 's champions league campaign next season but will also find competition at his new home .
he will be vying for a starting place with strikers of the caliber of roy makaay , claudio pizarro and roque santa cruz . podolski is unlikely to be fazed by such competition - such is his belief in his own ability which is backed up with hard facts .
the prince scored 22 goals in 51 top flight games for cologn , while his season in the second division saw him bag 24 goals in 30 games .
his record for the german national team is also impressive with a goal ratio of one every two matches .
he has scored 12 goals in 24 appearances to date . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hsv challenge bayern 's pulling power in pursuit of podolski germany striker lukas podolski looked destined to leave his beloved cologne for bayern munich in 2006 .

what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .

of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .

it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?

" i 'm happy the transfer has been worked out , " podolski told a news conference at germany 's world cup training camp .
" i 'm looking forward to a new challenge , a new city and a new club .
bayern are the best in germany .
it 's the best address . " " bayern are number one and i want to measure myself against the best , " said the 20-year-old striker at düsseldorf 's hilton hotel after signing on the dotted line with his new employers . despite sending cologne into a period of mourning , the deal is a remarkable piece of business for the city 's soccer club .
the prince , as he was known to his adoring supporters , could have left after next season for a fixed fee of one million euros as stipulated in a clause in his last contract with the club . relegation a drop too far for ambitious poldi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second division ?
no thanks but while bayern munich won the championship at the end of this season , cologne were relegated and podolski had made it known that he did not want to miss another year in the bundesliga despite his loyalty to his home-town club .
podolski spent one season in the second division with cologne in 2004/05 .
" another year in the second division was n't acceptable for me , " he said . podolski , who turns 21 on sunday , will reportedly earn 2.5 million euros a year with his new club . cologne president wolfgang overath , while sorry to see the club 's prize possession leave , was satisfied with the conclusion of the long-running courtship .
" we are all happy with the solution , " ' he said after what he called " fair negotiations . "
with the coffers swelled with at least ten times as much as they were expecting for the young striker , he added : " we can live with the result . " " he is an outstanding footballer but still has some things to learn , " he concluded . bayern and germany happy at star 's transfer to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi is a favorite , regardless of what team he plays for the bayern hierarchy was obviously just as satisfied at getting a prodigious talent like podolski on their books .
" we are very happy and content that we were able to bring one of the most talented german internationals to bayern , " said club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge . the transfer was also welcomed by the german international set-up of which podolski has become an integral member .
germany assistant coach joachim löw said he believed the move to bayern was the correct one .
" he is an exceptional talent , " said löw .
" now he will be properly challenged , will be able to play in international competition and will have to fight for his place . " podolski will not only get the chance to test himself against the best defenses in europe as part of bayern 's champions league campaign next season but will also find competition at his new home .
he will be vying for a starting place with strikers of the caliber of roy makaay , claudio pizarro and roque santa cruz . podolski is unlikely to be fazed by such competition - such is his belief in his own ability which is backed up with hard facts .
the prince scored 22 goals in 51 top flight games for cologn , while his season in the second division saw him bag 24 goals in 30 games .
his record for the german national team is also impressive with a goal ratio of one every two matches .
he has scored 12 goals in 24 appearances to date . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hsv challenge bayern 's pulling power in pursuit of podolski germany striker lukas podolski looked destined to leave his beloved cologne for bayern munich in 2006 .

" i 'm happy the transfer has been worked out , " podolski told a news conference at germany 's world cup training camp .
" i 'm looking forward to a new challenge , a new city and a new club .
bayern are the best in germany .
it 's the best address . " " bayern are number one and i want to measure myself against the best , " said the 20-year-old striker at düsseldorf 's hilton hotel after signing on the dotted line with his new employers . despite sending cologne into a period of mourning , the deal is a remarkable piece of business for the city 's soccer club .

no thanks but while bayern munich won the championship at the end of this season , cologne were relegated and podolski had made it known that he did not want to miss another year in the bundesliga despite his loyalty to his home-town club .
podolski spent one season in the second division with cologne in 2004/05 .
" another year in the second division was n't acceptable for me , " he said . podolski , who turns 21 on sunday , will reportedly earn 2.5 million euros a year with his new club . cologne president wolfgang overath , while sorry to see the club 's prize possession leave , was satisfied with the conclusion of the long-running courtship .
" we are all happy with the solution , " ' he said after what he called " fair negotiations . "
with the coffers swelled with at least ten times as much as they were expecting for the young striker , he added : " we can live with the result . " " he is an outstanding footballer but still has some things to learn , " he concluded . bayern and germany happy at star 's transfer to munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi is a favorite , regardless of what team he plays for the bayern hierarchy was obviously just as satisfied at getting a prodigious talent like podolski on their books .
" we are very happy and content that we were able to bring one of the most talented german internationals to bayern , " said club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge . the transfer was also welcomed by the german international set-up of which podolski has become an integral member .
germany assistant coach joachim löw said he believed the move to bayern was the correct one .
" he is an exceptional talent , " said löw .
" now he will be properly challenged , will be able to play in international competition and will have to fight for his place . " podolski will not only get the chance to test himself against the best defenses in europe as part of bayern 's champions league campaign next season but will also find competition at his new home .
he will be vying for a starting place with strikers of the caliber of roy makaay , claudio pizarro and roque santa cruz . podolski is unlikely to be fazed by such competition - such is his belief in his own ability which is backed up with hard facts .
the prince scored 22 goals in 51 top flight games for cologn , while his season in the second division saw him bag 24 goals in 30 games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 opinion : eu destined for embarrassment in dr congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans soldiers will soon be carrying out their duty in dr congo germany 's parliament has agreed to help secure elections in the democratic republic of congo set for july 30 .
deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .
if things go awry , europe will have embarrassed itself as a global player . andreas noll -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves dr congo mission the german parliament officially approved the deployment of troops to take part in a european mission in dr congo during planned elections there .
it will be the bundeswehr 's first presence on african soil in 12 years .
-lrb- june 1 , 2006 -rrb- " the un counts on europe " in dr congo albrecht conze , the political director of the un mission in the democratic republic of congo , talked to dw-world.de about the upcoming elections and the role of european troops to safeguard them .
-lrb- may 27 , 2006 -rrb- germans enjoy good reputation among congolese people in congo were happy to hear that german soldiers will be among those headed to congo as part of the eu force keeping the peace during the country 's first free elections .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it . " the originators of the letter and the operators of the internet page want to unnerve the population and cast the world cup in a negative light , " the statement read .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it . " the originators of the letter and the operators of the internet page want to unnerve the population and cast the world cup in a negative light , " the statement read .

nyse group inc .
deutsche börse was given the cold shoulder by paris-based euronext , which opted on thursday to enter a merger with a rival bidder , the new york stock exchange group , creating the first transatlantic securities market . nyse group inc. said thursday it would acquire the pan-european stock market euronext for 7.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.96 billion -rrb- in cash and stock , confirming long-running speculation about a merger that would usher in a new era for financial markets - one in which investors can trade stocks , options , futures , commodities and corporate bonds on two continents up to 12 hours a day . in a joint statement , the leading us and pan-european securities trading exchanges said they had signed an agreement to combine " in a merger of equals , " in a new group called nyse euronext . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euronext decided the best way to go for growth was by merging with nyse group the 214-year-old nyse trumped a competing bid by deutsche börse , the german operator of the frankfurt stock exchange , to acquire paris-based euronext , which operates bourses in paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon . under the deal , nyse euronext will be a us holding company , listed on the nyse and trading in dollars and on the euronext paris , trading in euros . its us headquarters will be located in new york and its international headquarters in paris and amsterdam .
london will be the center of its derivatives business . building a global marketplace once combined , the nyse and euronext will handle about 2.1 trillion dollars in stock trades each month and have a market value of about 20 billion dollars . " this is an important development in the history of the nyse , euronext and the global capital markets , " nyse chief executive john thain said in a statement . " a partnership with euronext fulfills our shared vision of building a truly global marketplace with great breadth of product and geographic reach that will benefit all investors , issuers , and our shareholders and stakeholders . " under the terms of the agreement , euronext shareholders will have the right to exchange each of their shares for 0.98 nyse euronext shares and 21.32 euros in cash .
euronext also will pay its previously announced extraordinary distribution of 3 euros per share . the companies said they expect to complete their merger within six months after having received a green light from us and european competition authorities . what 's next for deutsche börse ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse still has plenty of opportunities for a deal in europe , anaylsts say deutsche börse was not available for comment on thursday about what its next move might be , but the nyse 's move ups the ante for the bourse operator to assemble its own deal to avoid being left behind in global consolidation . euronext 's rejection of deutsche börse 's offer marks the fourth time in less than a year that the german group has unsuccessfully launched a takeover bid . reactions to the news in frankfurt were varied . " it 's clearly a slap in the face for deutsche börse , " one trader told reuters .
" however , no one seriously thought that they would have a chance with euronext . " an analyst who declined to be named preferred to see the silver lining , saying that deutsche börse still has plenty of opportunities for a merger deal within europe . " maybe it 's a good thing that the marriage with euronext did n't work out , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2006 mcdonald 's , coke run afoul of german law with ball-bottle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are n't lovin ' the special world cup drink-ball world cup sponsors mcdonald 's and coca-cola are accused of violating german laws on drinks packaging and recycling with their special edition cola bottle in the shape of a soccer ball . given that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are two of the world cup 's top sponsors , you 'd expect them to cooperate on a promotional gimmick to exploit the situation .
enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

officials declined to specify measures or label them sanctions .
but they are thought to include a range of trade , security and technology incentives as well as the threat of unspecified penalties . " we consider it a step forward in our quest to deny iran a nuclear weapons capability , " said us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns .
" we are very satisfied . " possible arms embargo a draft proposal of the text seen by afp includes helping iran build light water reactors for its civilian nuclear energy program . according to this text , possible sanctions could include an arms embargo against iran - something russia , a key arms supplier to iran , and china , a major consumer of iranian oil , resist - but that sanctions would be targeted rather than a full economic or other boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has said it wo n't cease its nuclear activities the agreement by six of the world 's most powerful nations caps months of diplomacy during which the united states has tried to meet russian and chinese demands to avoid escalating the showdown over iran 's nuclear program . after three years of a un investigation of iran 's program , a senior us state department official said tehran would be presented with the proposals within a few days and would have only " weeks " to answer . calling the proposals " far-reaching , " british foreign secretary margaret beckett urged tehran to respond positively to the benefits on offer in order to allay fears that it is seeking nuclear weapons and to avoid facing un security council punishment which could include sanctions . " the proposals offer iran a chance to reach a negotiated agreement , " she said . holding to the line one diplomat said that the powers held to the line of us secretary of state condoleezza rice that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment activities as a condition for talks to resume .
enrichment makes nuclear reactor fuel but can also be used for atom bomb material . rice had wednesday set this as a condition for washington to join european union negotiators britain , france and germany in talks with iran .
openness to such talks with iran is a major policy switch by the united states , 26 years after it broke off diplomatic relations with tehran when islamic militants took over the country . washington claims iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons under the cover of what tehran says is a peaceful effort to generate electricity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national intelligence director john negroponte says that iran could have a nuclear bomb by 2010 us officials stressed the package offered had bite , despite some diplomats saying the disincentive side had been watered down .
a us state department official said : " what we have is a commitment from our partners that if iran -lrb- does n't take the hand extended -rrb- , the security council will take the measures necessary and these measures will have teeth . " diplomats said this was designed to avoid offending iran and to draw it into negotiations , in a clear effort at more savvy public diplomacy than the confrontational mode of the past . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov early friday voiced moscow 's hope that iran would respond to the deal . " together at the negotiating table we will be able to work out a way that would allow us to ensure iran 's legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy and yet maintain the non-proliferation regime , " was quoted by the itar-tass news agency as telling russian reporters here . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe hails us offer of talks with iran on the eve of meetings over iran 's nuclear aspirations in vienna , the us offered to join direct talks for the first time .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way . " gül expressed hope that germany would continue to back turkey 's membership aspirations . ankara lost a staunch supporter in germany when gerhard schröder lost in last year 's elections to incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who is cool towards turkish membership . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .

enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

officials declined to specify measures or label them sanctions .
but they are thought to include a range of trade , security and technology incentives as well as the threat of unspecified penalties . " we consider it a step forward in our quest to deny iran a nuclear weapons capability , " said us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns .
" we are very satisfied . " possible arms embargo a draft proposal of the text seen by afp includes helping iran build light water reactors for its civilian nuclear energy program . according to this text , possible sanctions could include an arms embargo against iran - something russia , a key arms supplier to iran , and china , a major consumer of iranian oil , resist - but that sanctions would be targeted rather than a full economic or other boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has said it wo n't cease its nuclear activities the agreement by six of the world 's most powerful nations caps months of diplomacy during which the united states has tried to meet russian and chinese demands to avoid escalating the showdown over iran 's nuclear program . after three years of a un investigation of iran 's program , a senior us state department official said tehran would be presented with the proposals within a few days and would have only " weeks " to answer . calling the proposals " far-reaching , " british foreign secretary margaret beckett urged tehran to respond positively to the benefits on offer in order to allay fears that it is seeking nuclear weapons and to avoid facing un security council punishment which could include sanctions . " the proposals offer iran a chance to reach a negotiated agreement , " she said . holding to the line one diplomat said that the powers held to the line of us secretary of state condoleezza rice that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment activities as a condition for talks to resume .
enrichment makes nuclear reactor fuel but can also be used for atom bomb material . rice had wednesday set this as a condition for washington to join european union negotiators britain , france and germany in talks with iran .
openness to such talks with iran is a major policy switch by the united states , 26 years after it broke off diplomatic relations with tehran when islamic militants took over the country . washington claims iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons under the cover of what tehran says is a peaceful effort to generate electricity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national intelligence director john negroponte says that iran could have a nuclear bomb by 2010 us officials stressed the package offered had bite , despite some diplomats saying the disincentive side had been watered down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it . " the originators of the letter and the operators of the internet page want to unnerve the population and cast the world cup in a negative light , " the statement read .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it . " the originators of the letter and the operators of the internet page want to unnerve the population and cast the world cup in a negative light , " the statement read .
" the originators of the phony letter and the phony internet page could face criminal consequences .

in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .
" the neoclassical sculptures made in the united states at the time of the new deal look just like the sculptures produced in germany in the 1930s , in the soviet union , italy , or at the palais chaillot in paris . " jewish cou n cil speaks out rosh and giordano may have cause to rethink their demands following a statement issued by germany 's central council of jews on wednesday .
the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said the calls to tear down or cover up the statues were " completely out of place . " it 's " completely wrong , " to wipe away these traces of history , he said , adding that such a move would only play into the hands of those who would like to forget about the past and sweep it all under the rug . a better approach is to treat the whole complex , sculptures included , as problematic and to show " how the nazis tried to abuse images of the human body for their propaganda purposes , " kramer said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germania : visions of grandeur had hitler won the war , his plan was to transform berlin into germania - the city he planned with architect albert speer .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough .

dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .

it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .
-lrb- may 16 , 2006 -rrb- illegals in germany face similar problems as those in us with the status and protests of illegal immigrants in the united states making the headlines over the past days and weeks , the same question can be posed for germany : how do illegal immigrants fare in this country ?
-lrb- may 2 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett .

in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .
-lrb- may 16 , 2006 -rrb- illegals in germany face similar problems as those in us with the status and protests of illegal immigrants in the united states making the headlines over the past days and weeks , the same question can be posed for germany : how do illegal immigrants fare in this country ?
-lrb- may 2 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett .

deutsche welle 's andreas noll does n't think dr congo is apt territory for the eu to prove itself militarily . first kosovo , djibouti and afghanistan , and now the democratic republic of congo .
four hundred forty parliamentarians decided thursday that german soldiers will have to gather up their field-packs in just a few weeks .
nevertheless , the 780 soldiers will go forth with a queasy feeling in their stomachs - despite the majority approval , no truly convincing arguments for the mission in central africa were to be heard in the bundestag . the dr congo mission is not about defending germany 's security interests , even though government leaders in berlin have been openly demanding a fair cutback of raw materials in the country .
no , the official task is to support the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections , which optimists believe may contribute to stabilization of the region . poor preparation on both continents but how serious can europe really be about this mission , when central africa 's big hope rests on the shoulders of just 2,000 european soldiers , many of whom will never actually be stationed in the country ?
and what are they supposed to secure in this country saddled with unrest ?
a poorly prepared election in which former warlords will surrender to the ballot ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr congo 's president joseph kabila may be the biggest beneficiary of the eu mission if the observers are right , then interim president joseph kabila will profit more than anyone else from the presence of european soldiers in dr congo .
as far as security goes , he prefers to rely on his private army .
kabila is friendly with the french , who are involved in power politics in the region and therefore play a decisive role in the conflict .
paris is only concerned with stability and the status quo in africa , regardless of whether dictators or democrats come out on top .
since no one wants to hear about that in berlin , france was able to lure the germans into dr congo by assuring them that the mission would strengthen the european union 's position as a global security power . no place for symbolism that all sounds very nice , but dr congo is a poor choice for improving the eu 's reputation .
as soon as the situation escalates , the european mini-force will have to make a run for it - and leave a lot of disappointed people behind .
those in charge are hoping that the soldiers will somehow manage to survive the four-month mission and make it back in one piece .
talk of symbolism was dropped long ago .
but the dr congo mission is unsuitable for symbolism anyway .
the eu partners know that and have offered inadequate support to germany as the mission 's leading nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did france talk germany into joining the dr congo mission in order to protect its own power interests in the region ?
the german government had a bad experience with symbolic politics once before .
six years ago , it sent the bundeswehr to east timor to support un soldiers there .
but the troops were quickly called home again when it became apparent that the effort invested in the mission was entirely ineffective .
if everything goes well , this experience will repeat itself in dr congo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2006 mcdonald 's , coke run afoul of german law with ball-bottle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are n't lovin ' the special world cup drink-ball world cup sponsors mcdonald 's and coca-cola are accused of violating german laws on drinks packaging and recycling with their special edition cola bottle in the shape of a soccer ball . given that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are two of the world cup 's top sponsors , you 'd expect them to cooperate on a promotional gimmick to exploit the situation .
enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way . " gül expressed hope that germany would continue to back turkey 's membership aspirations . ankara lost a staunch supporter in germany when gerhard schröder lost in last year 's elections to incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who is cool towards turkish membership . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

" very important progress has been achieved in the efforts for solution and there are very strong signs that they will be successful , " he told reporters after talks with his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül . steinmeier flew to ankara from vienna , where foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members , plus germany , agreed late thursday to offer iran a package of benefits if it suspends sensitive nuclear fuel work . the offer came with a threat of penalties , including un sanctions , if iran refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . steinmeier said he was optimistic that tehran would agree to the proposals , aimed at easing concerns that iran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a drive for civilian energy . " we are hopeful that iran will study the proposals very carefully and with a sense of responsibility and that a positive response will emerge , " he said .
" i think the us decision will be influential in iran 's evaluation .
that is why we are optimistic . " steinmeier was referring to a conditional us offer to join european-led talks with the islamic republic if it suspended enrichment work .
iran on thursday rejected the us conditions , saying it was ready for the talks but unwilling to freeze sensitive nuclear work . the german minister expressed hope that russia and china would follow the us example and join the same talks . turkey pushed to allow cypriot use of ports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is seen with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül while in ankara , steinmeier also urged turkey to ratify by the end of 2006 a key customs union protocol with the european union that would open turkish ports to cypriot use . " there is still no development regarding the protocol 's ratification , " he told reporters .
" we wish that this issue will be resolved by the end of the year , before germany takes over the eu presidency .
we are determined to keep up our efforts on this issue . " in july , turkey extended an existing customs union accord with the eu to the 10 newest members , including cyprus , whose internationally recognized greek cypriot government ankara refuses to endorse . since then , the government has failed to send the document to parliament for a final ratification . the eu says the accord entitles all bloc members to use turkish air and sea ports , but ankara insists that greek cypriots would remain barred unless international restrictions imposed on the breakaway turkish cypriot northern part of the island are simultaneously lifted . despite the rift over cyprus , steinmeier said the accession talks with turkey , which opened on october 4 , " are moving forward in a positive way . " gül expressed hope that germany would continue to back turkey 's membership aspirations . ankara lost a staunch supporter in germany when gerhard schröder lost in last year 's elections to incumbent chancellor angela merkel , who is cool towards turkish membership . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2006 mcdonald 's , coke run afoul of german law with ball-bottle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are n't lovin ' the special world cup drink-ball world cup sponsors mcdonald 's and coca-cola are accused of violating german laws on drinks packaging and recycling with their special edition cola bottle in the shape of a soccer ball . given that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are two of the world cup 's top sponsors , you 'd expect them to cooperate on a promotional gimmick to exploit the situation .
enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

the city authorities have denied any involvement . just hours after the german world cup organizing committee sent out an advisory statement to german fans asking them to respect their pets this summer by not painting them in the national colors , a strange but believable letter began to drop through the letter boxes of houses across the city of cologne . given fifa 's love of control and germany 's world famous affection for order , the letter has caused a raging debate across the city as to whether the world cup 's organizers have finally cracked under the pressure or that someone in the western german city is making a funny , yet poignant statement . the letter contains a list of " suitable behavioral practices " that should be followed during the world cup in the host city .
soccer fans are banned from displaying any products - soccer-related or otherwise - visible from the street if they are not produced by an official world cup partner .
the letter also advises supporters that the singing of unlicensed , unofficial songs will not be tolerated with a specified " control zone . " u n lice n sed products ba n n ed from match days this means that any unlicensed clothing , world cup items , flags , towels and music being displayed , played or sung during world cup games in the city will result in the offender being fined for breach of fifa and world cup 2006 copyright laws . the letter and accompanying web site , attributed to the " cologne organizing committee of the 2006 fifa world cup " , has caused such a stir in the city that the cologne authorities have had to issue an official denial that they had anything to do with it . " the originators of the letter and the operators of the internet page want to unnerve the population and cast the world cup in a negative light , " the statement read .
" the originators of the phony letter and the phony internet page could face criminal consequences .

enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2006 mcdonald 's , coke run afoul of german law with ball-bottle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are n't lovin ' the special world cup drink-ball world cup sponsors mcdonald 's and coca-cola are accused of violating german laws on drinks packaging and recycling with their special edition cola bottle in the shape of a soccer ball . given that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are two of the world cup 's top sponsors , you 'd expect them to cooperate on a promotional gimmick to exploit the situation .
enter the " drink-ball , " a soccer ball-shaped bottle of coke that comes as part of every official world cup 2006 menu at mcdonald 's . the limited edition coke ball-bottle is available only shortly before and during the world cup tournament in germany , austria , hungary and poland .
the idea , according to the two corporations , is that the round bottle will become a collector 's item . but therein lies the problem .
although the bottle is stamped with the word " mehrwegflasche , " indicating that it is a returnable bottle , mcdonald 's is not charging the customary deposit that is meant to ensure that the bottle will indeed be returned instead of tossed away after a single use .
nor , according to germany 's federal association of drinks retailers -lrb- gfgh -rrb- , has a system for returning or recycling the unusual bottle been implemented , meaning that people who choose not to keep their " collector 's item " have little choice but to throw it away . " braze n attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , consumers pay deposits on most drinks packaging this deviation from germany 's regulations on recyclable and returnable packaging has prompted protest from both the gfgh and the environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe . " this is an unbelievably brazen attack on the returnable bottle system , " said deutsche umwelthilfe 's director , jürgen resch .
" after the one-use lobby failed in their attempt to stop deposits being charged for non-returnable drinks packaging , we 're now seeing this sort of subtle consumer deception , where one-use containers are being disguised as environmentally friendly returnable bottles . " managing director of the gfgh , günther guder said he feared the mcdonald 's drink-ball would prompt other retailers to skirt regulations on packaging deposits and launch similar " collector 's edition " drinks . mcdo n ald 's : " ball is retur n able " mcdonald 's insists that its ball-shaped bottles are environmentally-friendly , because they can be returned to containers in its restaurants , and then recycled .
and while no agreement has been made for the bottles to be recycled along with the nationwide der grü n e pu n kt -lrb- green point -rrb- system , coca-cola said that the plastic containers can be recycled at the plant in genshagen , near berlin , where the drinks are manufactured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol indicates when an item is recyclable deutsche umwelthilfe , however , is convinced that mcdonald 's and coca-cola are breaking the law with their world cup bottle .
unless the burger chain is willing to come to an agreement to either stop the advertising campaign or stop selling the bottles , the environmentalists say they are prepared to file a lawsuit with the district court in munich , where mcdonald 's has its german headquarters . the federal environment ministry in berlin is on the side of the environmentalists .
a ministry spokesperson said it was " totally absurd " to label the drink-balls as returnable packaging .
and given the german government 's goal of making the soccer tournament an especially environmentally-friendly event , it now looks as though mcdonald 's will face pressure from the highest level to re-think its world cup-cola concept . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 " integration is not a one-way street " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : süssmuth says immigrants are aware of what 's required of them in a foreign country the un commission on international migration released a new report this week .
dw-world.de spoke to german member of the commission , rita süssmuth , about the challenges in shaping a modern migration policy . rita süssmuth , a former preside n t of the germa n federal parliame n t a n d a former federal mi n ister for family affairs , wome n , youth a n d health is a member of the christia n democratic u n io n -lrb- cdu -rrb- party .
she 's a respected expert o n migratio n a n d serves o n a variety of global orga n izatio n s deali n g with migratio n , i n cludi n g the u n ited natio n s a n d the orga n izatio n for eco n omic cooperatio n a n d developme n t -lrb- oecd -rrb- . dw-world.de : the un global commissio n o n i n ter n atio n al migratio n i n troduced a n ew report this week i n berli n .
it says that migratio n is a n i n ter n atio n al phe n ome n o n that ca n o n ly be met with global solutio n s .
what do you thi n k are the biggest challe n ges that the world commu n ity faces ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth says most migration is n't voluntary rita süssmuth : among the estimated 200 million migrants worldwide , the majority make up what is called " forced migration . "
that means these people have n't left their countries voluntarily , but because of extreme poverty , war or political violence .
simply on the basis of human rights , we must get away from this forced migration to more voluntary , legal migration in order to help people live a dignified and safe life . a second big problem includes the different expectations both on the part of the refugee as well as of the host country .
most migrants want to have a better and safer life .
they leave their homelands in order to survive .
among the host countries , there are some who have a huge need for migrants as workers .
and then are other countries such as germany , with a high unemployment rate , which have hugely choked immigration in the past 10 years .
that 's why illegal migration is on the rise . the third challenge lies in the fact that there 's overpopulation in certain regions of the world whereas in others - particularly europe - the population is shrinking and ageing .
most nations nowadays have a demographic problem .
the solutions have to result in a win-win situation for both the countries that export migrants as well as those that take them in . i n the report you 've suggested ways to better shape a n d steer i n ter n atio n al migratio n .
a n d you urge n tly advise that the positive effects of migratio n should be e n couraged .
what exactly are those ? the most important positive effects lie in human potential which means in the people themselves .
in germany we talk too little about how migration has contributed to economic wealth and also in a social and cultural sense .
let 's talk about the economic aspect - germany may have made mistakes when it recruited millions of guest workers between 1956 and 1973 because we largely took in untrained workers with low education levels .
but we should n't forget to what extent the migrants made up for the acute lack of workers . or let 's look at the current situation : the asparagus- or strawberry pickers or the most important field of providing for the old and the sick .
can you imagine what would happen in some households or in hospitals if we did n't have migrants ?
and we 're not even talking about the economy and sciences as yet .
after all , immigrants also work at the highest levels in our country . the commissio n tried to fi n d complex solutio n s for the complex problem of global migratio n .
how does that work ?
ca n migratio n be steered ? yes , through bilateral agreements among other things - for instance between albania and italy .
the migrants are then told that they get a visa for three visits , that they have a limited residency permit and that their country will then take them back .
for instance many african countries lure back their migrants who go to foreign countries .
they offer the migrants dual citizenship or offer them bank loans so they can be self-employed .
for instance there are also agreements through which doctors in developing countries in africa are trained in developed countries and then can go back to their homelands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain faces a huge problem of illegal immigration from africa above all , it 's about drawing up common regulations worldwide for taking in refugees such as already exists in the european union .
that 's to prevent what 's happening currently in spain - that one country has to bear the entire burden of illegal immigration .
africa for instance is already following the european model .
we 're saying that we need more cooperation and coordination on an international , national and regional level .
there has to be more of an exchange of experiences so that governments think about new rules and laws and also implement them . do a lot of host cou n tries first have to lear n how to deal with migra n ts i n the first place ? yes , i think so .
take germany , for instance , which has for decades said the migrants will only work for a limited time and then all of them will go back home .
but many have stayed .
of course we have limited residence permits in all countries .
but if we 're going to stay together permanently then we have to get acquainted with the culture of the newcomer and also the other way around : the migrant has to get familiar with the culture of the adopted country too .
we have to learn to live together peacefully with people not just from 30 or 40 nations , but more than 100 .
and it 's also about mutually learning from each other .
it ca n't be just a one-way street where you just make demands on the immigrants . at first glance , the multicultural daily life in the streets of our cities appears very colorful .
but when it really comes to living next to each other , door to door , that 's when real challenges to integration arise . so the migra n ts also have respo n sibilities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants know well what demands are made on them in a foreign country , says süssmuth the main duties and responsibilities lie with the migrants .
if you follow the debates in the countries then you always hear the host country saying to the immigrants : you must learn the language , you should integrate yourselves with our way of life , you should get to know our constitution and history and you have to make sure that you find work and do n't live off social handouts . immigrants know very well what demands are made on them .
it is n't a blind love affair .
those who go to another country know the risks and the stress involved and the efforts required .
i have to always be better as a migrant , better than the locals , so that i pass the test . roman garthoff interviewed rita süssmuth -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

commissioned by the national socialist dictatorship when the stadium was built to host the 1936 olympic games , the sculptures are now a visual reminder of the racist aryan ideology propagated during the third reich . in the early 1990s , when berlin unsuccessfully applied to host the olympic games , the sculptures were described as " the delusion of racism carved in stone . "
and though their removal was called for , they remained as a testament - albeit a problematic one - to the past . two years ago , when the stadium was renovated and modernized for the world cup , it was clear that the site 's history would remain palpable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly renovated olympic stadium in berlin will host six world cup matches " whenever you enter , you will still know this was the site of the 1936 games , " peter steinhorst , chief technician of the renovation , said at the time .
" you will pass all the old nazi sculptures . " but now , the idea of thousands of international visitors passing through the entrance for the six world cup matches that will be played in berlin is proving too much for at least two outspoken critics - lea rosh , a journalist and initiator of the city 's holocaust memorial , and ralph giordano , a leading german jewish novelist . deali n g with rem n a n ts of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breker statue of prometheus rosh particularly objects to the sculptures on the site created by arno breker , the best known sculptor of the nazi era .
breker accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
breker sculpted the female victor and the decathlete for the stadium . " at the very least , the figures by arno breker should be covered up , but then with an explanation as to why , " rosh told the berlin tabloid b.z.
" breker was a big time nazi .
it 's bad enough that these statues are even allowed to be in public places . " giordano , whose family was persecuted by the nazis , has backed rosh , calling for the removal of sculptures such as the towering statues of a discus thrower and relay runner by karl albiker . " the figures are ugly and deceitful , " giordano told reporters .
" i demand that they be quickly taken down and turned into rubble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralph giordano would prefer to see the sculptures torn down " they should have gone a long time ago , " the writer added .
" just to cover them up would be only too symbolic - symbolic of how germany deals with its nazi past , which is to say , not consequently enough . " officials from the city 's ministries for culture and sport have rejected the calls to remove the sculptures , saying that in itself would be a denial of the past . " people wo n ' t be shocked " ursel berger , the curator of a newly opened exhibit at the georg kolbe museum about the sculptures on the olympic grounds , agreed .
she also told b.z. that in 1936 , people did n't see the sculptures in any racist context , but rather as decorative elements that - at the time - were commonly found on buildings of this sort . " nobody was shocked in 1936 , " said berger .
" and the international world cup visitors today wo n't be any different , because such sculptures also adorn other european stadiums . " christoph stölzl , historian and vice-president of berlin 's city council , recommended that the sculptures be accompanied by explanatory plaques . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the 1936 olympic games in nazi germany " the connection between idealization of the body and racism is very complicated , because there were both right and left wing variations on the body cult , " stölzl told b.z.
" the art of the 20th century was often wrapped up in dictatorships . " he said that the individual stories of the artists were decisive in making a judgment on the appropriateness of the sculptures . " the style was in step with the zeitgeist , " stölzl said .
" the neoclassical sculptures made in the united states at the time of the new deal look just like the sculptures produced in germany in the 1930s , in the soviet union , italy , or at the palais chaillot in paris . " jewish cou n cil speaks out rosh and giordano may have cause to rethink their demands following a statement issued by germany 's central council of jews on wednesday .
the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said the calls to tear down or cover up the statues were " completely out of place . " it 's " completely wrong , " to wipe away these traces of history , he said , adding that such a move would only play into the hands of those who would like to forget about the past and sweep it all under the rug . a better approach is to treat the whole complex , sculptures included , as problematic and to show " how the nazis tried to abuse images of the human body for their propaganda purposes , " kramer said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germania : visions of grandeur had hitler won the war , his plan was to transform berlin into germania - the city he planned with architect albert speer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2006 germany 's greens switch tracks on integration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to an estimated 13 million foreigners in a departure from their hitherto foreigner-friendly credentials , germany 's green party unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants to do more to integrate themselves and take their responsibilities seriously . for decades , germany 's green party , long-known for its pacifist and environmentally-friendly stance , has been considered to have a benevolent attitude towards the country 's immigrants - the underlying principle has been to allow them to nurture their culture and traditions in their adopted country . the position has n't been entirely uncontroversial .
in a reference to their benign tolerance of the sometimes jarring cultural differences displayed for instance by its large turkish minority , some people germans have disparagingly called the greens the " foreigner 's friend " or the party of " cuddly multicultural policies . " in an abrupt turnaround this week , however , the greens unveiled a policy paper urging immigrants in the country to do their bit towards ensuring they integrated into german society . " nobody is infallible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast wants immigrants to be actively involved in society protecting immigrants from discrimination and xenophobia has always been at the heart of green policies , said renate künast , head of the green parliamentary group on wednesday .
now it 's about both " encouraging and making demands " from immigrants she added .
the policy paper also spoke of immigrants as " citizens of this country with all the corresponding rights , but also with responsibilities . " referring to the sudden change in the party 's stance on foreigners , künast simply said , " nobody is infallible . " her party had realized too late that " immigrants are also citizens , " künast said .
she added , however , that her party had been one of the first to accept that germany was an immigration country , pointing to the country 's first immigration law , which was hammered out by the greens and the social democrats in the previous government led by chancellor gerhard schröder . paper puts onus on immigrants according to the document released this week , the greens want to push naturalization of immigrants living in the country .
around 14.5 million foreigners are estimated to be currently living in the country .
only 1.5 million people have acquired german passports in the last 25 years .
germany 's citizenship law was eased in 2000 to also allow people without an ethnic german link to the country to be naturalized . the greens have also proposed an " integration agreement " as an instrument for better integration - also for those who do n't apply for a german passport .
though the details remain unclear , such an agreement would spell out rights and duties both for german society as well as for immigrants . another cornerstone of the green 's change in policy on foreigners included learning the german language .
while demanding that the government offer more language courses , the party wanted immigrants to " individually do the most to independently fulfill the conditions for naturalization . "
the greens also urged immigrants to take responsibility for bringing up and educating their children so they would have better chances for upward mobility in german society in future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green policy paper lays out what immigrants should do to better integrate themselves in a veiled reference to a spate of so-called honor killings among its turkish minority , the greens also said that immigrants or german citizens of foreign origin who distance themselves from their original cultural realm should n't be prevented from doing so . josef winkler , green party spokesman on immigration , also demanded this week that islam should be " naturalized , too . "
winkler said islamic religious education should be taught in german schools by teachers educated and trained in the country and that all students should be required to participate in swimming , sports lessons , class trips and biology classes . an exception for muslim students " is n't in keeping with the times and is discriminatory , " he said . " a realistic integration policy " the greens ' policy paper coincides with a heated debate in germany about how to better integrate immigrants in light of recent statistics pointing to a higher school drop-out rate , unemployment and rising violence among its younger immigrant population . the debate has also been fuelled by populist moves - which have since been scrapped - in a few german states to put up higher barriers for muslim immigrants applying for german citizenship . bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called the change in the greens ' policy on foreigners as " a late realization that their multicultural dreams have failed . " he added that the greens " must make way for a realistic integration policy free of ideology .

the money , announced at the urdd eisteddfod in ruthin on friday , will help to fund plans to nearly double its exhibition space .
culture minister alun pugh said the gallery was one of a growing number of exciting cultural venues emerging in wales .
work is set to begin early 2007 but a further £ 1m has to be raised for the project to go ahead .
the expansion plans will give the gallery three new exhibition spaces , an area for students and pupils to use as well as a meeting room , a cafe and more space for a craft shop .
there will be more areas for storage and handling enabling the gallery to borrow works from major collections .
plans also include a new exhibition space lit by natural light and the sheathing of the building 's tower in gold-coloured shingles to make it a " llandudno landmark . "
the outside of the building , currently in terracotta , will be refurbished .
gallery director martin barlow said : " this is great news for oriel mostyn and its many followers .
" we have a fantastic opportunity to develop our audience and reputation further and to offer the very best in welsh and international art to the people of wales , in particular the large numbers of people from north wales who visit our exhibitions . "
he added : " we still have a large fundraising challenge but this award gives us confidence that we will be successful . "
administrator mary heathcote said she hoped people in llandudno will appreciate the gold-coloured tower .
" there has been no negative feedback at all , " she said .
she said : " we have managed to bring major exhibitions to wales already - the turner in wales one took place , although admittedly that was 20 years ago . "
peter tyndall , chief executive of the arts council of wales , said oriel mostyn was one of wales ' leading regional contemporary arts galleries .
the gallery 's new exhibition programme will be planned in the year of closure .
if the project goes ahead , the gallery will reopen in spring 2008 .

the spa , which is more than three years overdue and millions of pounds over- budget , was expected to open in june .
but legal documents formalising the handover of the building to its operators have yet to be signed .
a council spokesperson said : " the pools are filled , the showers are ready , the lockers are waiting to be used - we 're counting down the days . "
he added : " the building work is done - we 're just making sure the i 's are dotted and the t 's are crossed . "
the spa was originally planned as a £ 19m millennium project but bitter rows and court battles with contractors saw costs rocket to more than £ 35m .
an nhs spa treatment centre on the site was closed on health grounds in 1978 and since then , attempts to restore the spas have failed because of cost and concerns over the purity of the water 's source .
but in 2000 , the millennium commission gave a grant of £ 7.78m to refurbish five listed buildings within the complex , including the 18th century hot bath and cross bath .
work on the ambitious project began soon afterwards , but the scheme has been plagued by a series of delays .
charlotte hanna , spokeswoman for operators thermae bath spa , said : " we 're at an exciting stage , gearing up to get on and open .
" it is frustrating not to have a date to work towards , but we are looking forward to it . "
an announcement of the plans for the opening date is expected soon .

louis nacke was portrayed -lrb- left -rrb- taking part in the passengers ' revolt " knowing the outcome of the day , i found myself rooting for a different ending , " kenny nacke says .
" hoping for a different ending .
thinking that they can succeed . "
for the 45-year-old maryland police officer , united 93 is not just a movie - it is a portrayal of the last two hours of his brother 's life .
louis j nacke ii - joey to his family - was one of 40 people on the plane , which went down after passengers took on the hijackers before they reached their target .
some critics have complained that after almost five years , it is still too early to portray 9/11 on the big screen .
but united 93 's british director paul greengrass won the blessing of the families of most passengers and crew .
for kenny nacke , the film was a chance to pay tribute to his brother and remind the world not to let something similar happen again .
it did n't make them like they were in fear for their lives - they rose above their fears kenny nacke but his hope for a happy ending was not denial or naive wishful thinking .
" it 's a horrific ending - it needed to be , " he says .
" but until it ends , the way he -lsb- greengrass -rsb- filmed it made you believe that they did n't think they were going to die .
" it made me feel like there was a strong chance that they could win and re-take the plane over and land it safely . "
that portrayal was " an honourable tribute to them " , he says .
" it did n't make them -lsb- look -rsb- like they were in fear for their lives .
they rose above their fears . "
director paul greengrass -lrb- standing -rrb- won over passengers ' families mr nacke has been doing media interviews arranged by film studio universal .
he had his reservations when greengrass and his team first approached the families , objecting to their use of the word " victim " .
" that just irritates the living heck out of me , " he says .
" granted , they are a victim of a crime .
but i think to be truly a victim , you sit idly by and events happen to you .
" they kinda controlled their own destiny .
they forced what happened . "
but greengrass won him over with his willingness to listen , his determination to make the film as accurate as possible and his intention not to focus on a few selected " heroes " .
it 's worth the pain , it 's worth the sorrow to open your eyes that there is an individual out there named joey nacke kenny nacke " they made as factual a movie as they could , " mr nacke says .
" for the families that 's what it 's all about .
" -lsb- greengrass -rsb- was n't going to make a hollywood movie .
he was n't going to glamorise the event or make our loved ones superheroes .
" he made them ordinary individuals - ordinary individuals doing an extraordinary deed . "
in the film , the hijackers are seen trying to fly towards the capitol building in washington dc - one of the biggest bones of contention because their target can only be guessed at .
but the passengers - who have heard about the world trade center attacks on mobile phones - decide to try to regain control and the plane crashes in the struggle .
flight 93 crashed in a field in pennsylvania on 11 september mr nacke 's brother , a 42-year-old toy distribution manager , is played by unknown actor corey johnson .
" i thank universal and paul greengrass for giving me the opportunity to extend my brother 's memory to a different continent , " he says .
" it 's worth the pain .
it 's worth the sorrow to open your eyes , or whoever chooses to read your article , that there is an individual out there named joey nacke and he was the oldest brother of four and he was loved and he was cherished . "
but this film does not give him closure , he says - that will never be possible .
" you just make your peace with it and move on and try to do the best job that you can in seeing that the memory of my brother and those 40 individuals are remembered , cherished forever , for generations to come . "
united 93 opens across the uk on friday .

louis nacke was portrayed -lrb- left -rrb- taking part in the passengers ' revolt " knowing the outcome of the day , i found myself rooting for a different ending , " kenny nacke says .
" hoping for a different ending .
thinking that they can succeed . "
for the 45-year-old maryland police officer , united 93 is not just a movie - it is a portrayal of the last two hours of his brother 's life .
louis j nacke ii - joey to his family - was one of 40 people on the plane , which went down after passengers took on the hijackers before they reached their target .
some critics have complained that after almost five years , it is still too early to portray 9/11 on the big screen .
but united 93 's british director paul greengrass won the blessing of the families of most passengers and crew .
for kenny nacke , the film was a chance to pay tribute to his brother and remind the world not to let something similar happen again .
it did n't make them like they were in fear for their lives - they rose above their fears kenny nacke but his hope for a happy ending was not denial or naive wishful thinking .
" it 's a horrific ending - it needed to be , " he says .
" but until it ends , the way he -lsb- greengrass -rsb- filmed it made you believe that they did n't think they were going to die .
" it made me feel like there was a strong chance that they could win and re-take the plane over and land it safely . "
that portrayal was " an honourable tribute to them " , he says .
" it did n't make them -lsb- look -rsb- like they were in fear for their lives .
they rose above their fears . "
director paul greengrass -lrb- standing -rrb- won over passengers ' families mr nacke has been doing media interviews arranged by film studio universal .
he had his reservations when greengrass and his team first approached the families , objecting to their use of the word " victim " .
" that just irritates the living heck out of me , " he says .
" granted , they are a victim of a crime .
but i think to be truly a victim , you sit idly by and events happen to you .
" they kinda controlled their own destiny .
they forced what happened . "
but greengrass won him over with his willingness to listen , his determination to make the film as accurate as possible and his intention not to focus on a few selected " heroes " .
it 's worth the pain , it 's worth the sorrow to open your eyes that there is an individual out there named joey nacke kenny nacke " they made as factual a movie as they could , " mr nacke says .
" for the families that 's what it 's all about .
" -lsb- greengrass -rsb- was n't going to make a hollywood movie .
he was n't going to glamorise the event or make our loved ones superheroes .
" he made them ordinary individuals - ordinary individuals doing an extraordinary deed . "
in the film , the hijackers are seen trying to fly towards the capitol building in washington dc - one of the biggest bones of contention because their target can only be guessed at .
but the passengers - who have heard about the world trade center attacks on mobile phones - decide to try to regain control and the plane crashes in the struggle .
flight 93 crashed in a field in pennsylvania on 11 september mr nacke 's brother , a 42-year-old toy distribution manager , is played by unknown actor corey johnson .
" i thank universal and paul greengrass for giving me the opportunity to extend my brother 's memory to a different continent , " he says .
" it 's worth the pain .
it 's worth the sorrow to open your eyes , or whoever chooses to read your article , that there is an individual out there named joey nacke and he was the oldest brother of four and he was loved and he was cherished . "
but this film does not give him closure , he says - that will never be possible .
" you just make your peace with it and move on and try to do the best job that you can in seeing that the memory of my brother and those 40 individuals are remembered , cherished forever , for generations to come . "
united 93 opens across the uk on friday .

river engineering expert fred pearce told bbc wales the project will cause severe environmental damage if built .
but another author , scientist james lovelock , said clean energy projects were needed to avoid climate change .
the 10 mile-long tidal barrage could be constructed between lavernock point , near cardiff , to brean down , somerset .
mr pearce was at the hay festival to talk about his book when the rivers run dry , which examines the often negative effect dam-building , irrigation and other human activities have had on water-courses around the world .
in a recent speech , first minister rhodri morgan told a conference that the barrage could be a welsh three gorges , referring to the world 's biggest hydro-electric project nearing completion on the yangtze river in china .
the barrage would stretch 10 miles across the bristol channel mr pearce , who also writes for new scientist magazine , told bbc wales that the comparison was unfortunate .
" it 'll probably cost as much and do as much environmental damage , " he said .
the welsh assembly government wants whitehall to carry out a feasibility study into the barrage and says some big companies are interested in investing in such a scheme .
it says by using the massive movement of tides in the estuary , the project could avoid the need to build several nuclear power stations .
the assembly government is opposed to more nuclear plants in wales .
' wasteful misuse ' there has been support for the idea of a barrage , however , from another author appearing at the festival .
in his book the revenge of gaia , scientist james lovelock said there was an urgent need for major clean energy projects like the barrage if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate change .
he said that money must be made available " for practical renewable energy schemes such as the severn estuary tidal barrage . "
he added : " this might provide a steady five to 10 % of the energy needs of our nation when we stop the present wasteful misuse . "
mr lovelock has been described as " one of the great thinkers of our time . "
his1979 book , gaia , made him a hero among environmentalists for the way it described the earth as something resembling a self-regulating organism that was under threat from human activity .
however , his recent calls for a revival of nuclear power in the uk have lost him friends in the environmental movement .
his calls for a severn barrage could prove equally controversial .

river engineering expert fred pearce told bbc wales the project will cause severe environmental damage if built .
but another author , scientist james lovelock , said clean energy projects were needed to avoid climate change .
the 10 mile-long tidal barrage could be constructed between lavernock point , near cardiff , to brean down , somerset .
mr pearce was at the hay festival to talk about his book when the rivers run dry , which examines the often negative effect dam-building , irrigation and other human activities have had on water-courses around the world .
in a recent speech , first minister rhodri morgan told a conference that the barrage could be a welsh three gorges , referring to the world 's biggest hydro-electric project nearing completion on the yangtze river in china .
the barrage would stretch 10 miles across the bristol channel mr pearce , who also writes for new scientist magazine , told bbc wales that the comparison was unfortunate .
" it 'll probably cost as much and do as much environmental damage , " he said .
the welsh assembly government wants whitehall to carry out a feasibility study into the barrage and says some big companies are interested in investing in such a scheme .
it says by using the massive movement of tides in the estuary , the project could avoid the need to build several nuclear power stations .
the assembly government is opposed to more nuclear plants in wales .
' wasteful misuse ' there has been support for the idea of a barrage , however , from another author appearing at the festival .
in his book the revenge of gaia , scientist james lovelock said there was an urgent need for major clean energy projects like the barrage if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate change .
he said that money must be made available " for practical renewable energy schemes such as the severn estuary tidal barrage . "
he added : " this might provide a steady five to 10 % of the energy needs of our nation when we stop the present wasteful misuse . "
mr lovelock has been described as " one of the great thinkers of our time . "
his1979 book , gaia , made him a hero among environmentalists for the way it described the earth as something resembling a self-regulating organism that was under threat from human activity .
however , his recent calls for a revival of nuclear power in the uk have lost him friends in the environmental movement .
his calls for a severn barrage could prove equally controversial .
