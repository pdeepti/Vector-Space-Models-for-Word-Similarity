the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced .

germany has so far opposed this . " this year we plan to repay in full our debt to the paris club , " vladimir putin told a russo-german business forum that he attended along with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian town of tomsk .
" we hope that germany , among other countries , can profit from our proposal . " putin did not say how much russia 's paris club debt was at present .
the paris club said in march 2005 that the russian debt stood at around $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.2 billion euros -rrb- .
russia has since repaid $ 15 billion , leaving a balance of around $ 25 billion .
the russian finance ministry in october however put the debt at $ 29.8 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is benefiting from rising gas and oil prices russia , flush with cash from soaring energy prices , has already prepaid debts to the international monetary fund and has long sought to retire the paris club debt ahead of schedule . its efforts however have so far been slowed by resistance from some creditor countries demanding that russia pay a premium to compensate them for the lost interest that early debt repayment would entail .
germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe . " the russia side underlined many times that there was no reason for worry , " said a kremlin spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow " gazprom as a company has never broken its commitments , " he added , referring to the state-controlled gas company , which had hinted it could look for customers in asia if europe does not open its market to the russian energy giant . a source in the german delegation confirmed that putin and merkel had stated their commitment to stability in energy supplies , the respect of contracts and the development of energy ties between germany and russia . putin and merkel were expected to focus on the iran nuclear crisis in their talks today before the chancellor heads back to germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin want strategic cooperation despite differences russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel met wednesday in the heart of siberia for talks on how to confront iran 's nuclear ambitions and on ways to ease anxiety about energy supply in europe .

under german law , the time in which she could be charged has lapsed . bleak background the woman has told investigators that she did the babies no harm but wrapped them up and let them die after giving birth alone under the influence of large amounts of alcohol , saying she drank herself into a stupor to dull her labor pains . the prosecution wanted sabine h. to face murder charges but the court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- said the charge must be reduced to manslaughter on the grounds that the crimes took place against a background of alcohol abuse and dire family problems . the accused and her husband , who is believed to have worked for the stasi , the feared former east german secret services , divorced in 2005 after years of marital strife . dna tests have shown that the couple was indeed the parents of all nine dead newborns . they have three surviving children and the husband is said not to have wanted any more .

" this will be difficult because the findings of the investigation were inconclusive on that point , " he told afp . he said his client was painfully aware of the prison sentence she risked and of the intense interest in the case .

" though nato is not directly involved in the iran crisis , the meeting will provide an obvious opportunity to take stock of the situation . " i would guess a lot of them are thinking about what happens if this deadline passes without a change of heart from the iranians , " a senior nato diplomat told the afp news agency . " nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union . " nato stands ready to extend our support and change the foundation of our mission there to include capacity building for a joint operations center , " scheffer said , adding nato would also be willing to help train troops headed to darfur .
" we are not talking about a nato force on the ground in darfur . " a request from the african union would be required before nato could increase its engagement in darfur .
that is currently being blocked by the sudanese government , which is also blocking un diplomats from entering darfur to evaluate conditions for a un peacekeeping force . slowi n g nato expa n sio n prolonging the expansion process for new nato members without ruffling any feathers seems to be scheffer 's plan for dealing with the alliance 's internal affairs . " this is a discussion which is starting now in sofia , " he said , avoiding any particulars on whether croatia , macedonia , albania , ukraine and georgia would be admitted to the alliance .
" it is clear that nato 's door is open , that nato supports reforms , but this is , as far as the aspirants are concerned , the important beginning of a discussion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussions on getting inside nato 's gates are just beginning scheffer added that expected a signal would be sent to the aspirant countries but admitted he did not know what that signal would be before the talks conclude . under pressure from the united states , the ministers will also address spreading the alliance farther to include anti-terrorism cooperation with asian and pacific countries . australia , japan , new zeeland and south korea have all expressed interest in closer ties with the brussels-based alliance , but scheffer said enhanced cooperation with the nations would not turn nato into a global entity . " this is not making nato into a global alliance , but it is making nato into an alliance with global partners because the threats and challenges are of a global nature , " he said . some nato members , including germany , france and poland , had expressed their concern about expanding the north atlantic treaty organization over too large an area . bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

if they want to attack the rights of the iranian people , we will stamp shame and regret on them . " iran insists it has a right to enrich to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make nuclear weapons .
western powers , led by the united states , are convinced iran is seeking either a nuclear bomb or the " strategic capacity " to make one . iran 's refusal to freeze enrichment by friday in line with last month 's un security council demand opens the door to sanctions , despite opposition from russia and china .
the united states has also not ruled out taking military action . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , was scheduled to release a report friday on iranian compliance .

under german law , the time in which she could be charged has lapsed . bleak background the woman has told investigators that she did the babies no harm but wrapped them up and let them die after giving birth alone under the influence of large amounts of alcohol , saying she drank herself into a stupor to dull her labor pains . the prosecution wanted sabine h. to face murder charges but the court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- said the charge must be reduced to manslaughter on the grounds that the crimes took place against a background of alcohol abuse and dire family problems . the accused and her husband , who is believed to have worked for the stasi , the feared former east german secret services , divorced in 2005 after years of marital strife . dna tests have shown that the couple was indeed the parents of all nine dead newborns . they have three surviving children and the husband is said not to have wanted any more .

" this will be difficult because the findings of the investigation were inconclusive on that point , " he told afp . he said his client was painfully aware of the prison sentence she risked and of the intense interest in the case .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in the west of the country .
" we will not bow to injustice and pressure .
if they want to attack the rights of the iranian people , we will stamp shame and regret on them . " iran insists it has a right to enrich to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make nuclear weapons .
western powers , led by the united states , are convinced iran is seeking either a nuclear bomb or the " strategic capacity " to make one . iran 's refusal to freeze enrichment by friday in line with last month 's un security council demand opens the door to sanctions , despite opposition from russia and china .
the united states has also not ruled out taking military action . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , was scheduled to release a report friday on iranian compliance .
senior diplomats from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany are due to discuss the next steps in a meeting in paris on tuesday , although ahmadinejad showed no sign of worry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad insists he only wants to use nuclear power in a peaceful way " they think that by frowning , adopting resolutions and going from one organization to the other , they can hide their horrible face and unjust decisions behind the agency and the security council and make us back down , " he said .
" we have obtained nuclear fuel technology by ourselves , and nobody can deprive us of it . " ahmadinejad also took a fresh swipe at israel by complaining that germany was being exploited by " greedy zionists " more than 60 years after world war ii . " look at the german people .
three generations ago , there was a war .
but today an intelligent people is still a hostage of world war ii , " he said in a speech carried on state television . germany , he said , " still does n't have the right to have independent policies or proper defences . " " every german born is indebted to the arrogant and greedy zionists , " ahmadinejad said , referring to german reparations for the holocaust . " when you visit a country , in every town there is a symbol of national pride , " ahmadinejad said , but added that in germany " every town has something saying to the great german people that their parent and grandparents were murderers . " last-minute talks fail last-minute talks between iran 's nuclear chief gholam reza aghazadeh and iaea director mohamed elbaradei on wednesday failed to make any headway , diplomats said . one diplomat said aghazadeh simply " just rattled around on iran 's previously stated positions .
he did not propose anything new . " the white house has warned the country was facing further international isolation after supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei threatened global retaliation to any american military action . iran has already warned that sanctions could force it to halt cooperation with the iaea or even quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . china , russia oppose action in beijing , chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang issued an appeal for calm . " we indeed think the iranian nuclear issue is at a crucial stage , " he said .
" we hope all parties concerned can keep calm , exercise restraint and create favorable conditions so as to properly resolve this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and china do n't want to take action in the security council russian president vladimir putin also said the iaea needed to continue playing a key role in the crisis - signaling his reluctance to see the matter fully referred to the security council . " it is too early to run ahead and say what decisions we might take together , " he said during a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian city of tomsk .
" the main thing is that any decisions that are made must be made in agreement . " merkel , whose country is iran 's largest european trading partner , also called for a diplomatic resolution to the standoff . nato dinner talk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaking in the bulgarian capital sofia , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer voiced concerns . " although it is not playing the first violin , what happens there -lrb- in iran -rrb- is a very nato-relevant subject , " he said as he prepared to host talks among the alliance 's foreign ministers including us secretary of state condoleezza rice .

" the russians rejected us .

while weber said he still speaks a german dialect , his wife admitted : " i 'm german but i do n't speak german . " hochweiss said she remembers being deported from moscow when she was six years old . " they forced us into a train carriage , my mother and the three children , " she said .
" my father had to work in a hard labor brigade .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?

russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .

they failed to agree on iran . just days after officials for russia 's gas giant gazprom worried europeans by saying that they could shift energy supplies to asian markets , gazprom ceo alexei miller and jürgen hambrecht , the head of german chemicals giant basf , signed a deal to jointly develop the massive yuzhno-russkoye gas field .
the field holds enough gas to cover german demand for five to seven years . in an asset swap agreement , basf subsidiary wintershall will get 25 percent minus one share of voting rights in the gas field 's development company as well as 10 percent with no voting rights .
gazprom in return will increase its stake in wingas , a joint venture with wintershall , from 35 percent to 50 percent minus one share .
wingas sells natural gas in germany .

" the agreement we have just signed demonstrates that russia and germany are able to build upon one another , " hambrecht said .
" it contributes to the further development of a stable and reilable partnership between gazprom and basf . " putin warns europe over energy russian president vladimir putin also hailed the deal as unprecedented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said the eu ca n't blame russians for cozying up to china " this is the first time in contemporary history that russia has allowed a foreign partner into gas production on a gigantic field , which will be exploited for decades , " he said . but putin also reiterated an earlier comment that russia would have to look for new markets if europeans started to explore alternative energy sources . " we regularly hera about the excessive dependence on russia and that russia 's delivery of energy resources to the european market should be limited , " he said .
" but understand us and see it from our position - what should we do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we will start to find other markets . " merkel : differing opinions reflecting on their meeting , german chancellor angela merkel said she and putin had " very open and intensive discussions ... often with differing opinions . " a day before the international atomic energy authority -lrb- iaea -rrb- is expected to issue a vital report on whether iran has met security council demands , merkel and putin also differed on how to proceed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's quite a bit of room between merkel 's and putin 's positions when it comes to iran while merkel said that the security council had to play an important role in dealing with tehran , putin said that the matter should stay with the iaea . " we think that the iaea must continue to play a major , key role and it must not shrug off its responsibilites to resolve such questions and shift them onto the un security council , " he said . russia , along with china , opposes sanctions against iran . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia to repay debt early despite german resistance meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal .

they failed to agree on iran . just days after officials for russia 's gas giant gazprom worried europeans by saying that they could shift energy supplies to asian markets , gazprom ceo alexei miller and jürgen hambrecht , the head of german chemicals giant basf , signed a deal to jointly develop the massive yuzhno-russkoye gas field .
the field holds enough gas to cover german demand for five to seven years . in an asset swap agreement , basf subsidiary wintershall will get 25 percent minus one share of voting rights in the gas field 's development company as well as 10 percent with no voting rights .
gazprom in return will increase its stake in wingas , a joint venture with wintershall , from 35 percent to 50 percent minus one share .
wingas sells natural gas in germany .
both companies will hold 50 percent of another joint venture called wingas europe , which distributes gas in europe outside germany . german energy giant e.on was supposed to sign a similar deal with gazprom , but this has been postponed as the two companies have not finalized negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom , e.on and basf are also jointly builing a new pipeline from russia to germany " perhaps gazprom wants assets that e.on is not willing to give up , " nils machemehl , an analyst at mm warburg , told reuters news service . " the agreement we have just signed demonstrates that russia and germany are able to build upon one another , " hambrecht said .
" it contributes to the further development of a stable and reilable partnership between gazprom and basf . " putin warns europe over energy russian president vladimir putin also hailed the deal as unprecedented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said the eu ca n't blame russians for cozying up to china " this is the first time in contemporary history that russia has allowed a foreign partner into gas production on a gigantic field , which will be exploited for decades , " he said . but putin also reiterated an earlier comment that russia would have to look for new markets if europeans started to explore alternative energy sources . " we regularly hera about the excessive dependence on russia and that russia 's delivery of energy resources to the european market should be limited , " he said .
" but understand us and see it from our position - what should we do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we will start to find other markets . " merkel : differing opinions reflecting on their meeting , german chancellor angela merkel said she and putin had " very open and intensive discussions ... often with differing opinions . " a day before the international atomic energy authority -lrb- iaea -rrb- is expected to issue a vital report on whether iran has met security council demands , merkel and putin also differed on how to proceed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's quite a bit of room between merkel 's and putin 's positions when it comes to iran while merkel said that the security council had to play an important role in dealing with tehran , putin said that the matter should stay with the iaea . " we think that the iaea must continue to play a major , key role and it must not shrug off its responsibilites to resolve such questions and shift them onto the un security council , " he said . russia , along with china , opposes sanctions against iran . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia to repay debt early despite german resistance meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .
germany has so far opposed this .

" nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union . " nato stands ready to extend our support and change the foundation of our mission there to include capacity building for a joint operations center , " scheffer said , adding nato would also be willing to help train troops headed to darfur .
" we are not talking about a nato force on the ground in darfur . " a request from the african union would be required before nato could increase its engagement in darfur .

" this is not making nato into a global alliance , but it is making nato into an alliance with global partners because the threats and challenges are of a global nature , " he said . some nato members , including germany , france and poland , had expressed their concern about expanding the north atlantic treaty organization over too large an area . bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

" nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union . " nato stands ready to extend our support and change the foundation of our mission there to include capacity building for a joint operations center , " scheffer said , adding nato would also be willing to help train troops headed to darfur .
" we are not talking about a nato force on the ground in darfur . " a request from the african union would be required before nato could increase its engagement in darfur .
that is currently being blocked by the sudanese government , which is also blocking un diplomats from entering darfur to evaluate conditions for a un peacekeeping force . slowi n g nato expa n sio n prolonging the expansion process for new nato members without ruffling any feathers seems to be scheffer 's plan for dealing with the alliance 's internal affairs . " this is a discussion which is starting now in sofia , " he said , avoiding any particulars on whether croatia , macedonia , albania , ukraine and georgia would be admitted to the alliance .
" it is clear that nato 's door is open , that nato supports reforms , but this is , as far as the aspirants are concerned , the important beginning of a discussion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussions on getting inside nato 's gates are just beginning scheffer added that expected a signal would be sent to the aspirant countries but admitted he did not know what that signal would be before the talks conclude . under pressure from the united states , the ministers will also address spreading the alliance farther to include anti-terrorism cooperation with asian and pacific countries . australia , japan , new zeeland and south korea have all expressed interest in closer ties with the brussels-based alliance , but scheffer said enhanced cooperation with the nations would not turn nato into a global entity . " this is not making nato into a global alliance , but it is making nato into an alliance with global partners because the threats and challenges are of a global nature , " he said . some nato members , including germany , france and poland , had expressed their concern about expanding the north atlantic treaty organization over too large an area . bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

he wants to win the second world cup title after 1998 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2006 " we greatly value our relationship with germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamal nath : " everybody 's given a fair chance in india " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy . how was your meeting with the new german chancellor angela merkel during the hanover fair ? i 've known angela merkel since the early 1990s .
she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced .

they could have been the victims of reprisals by czechs as the era of german rule came to a close . " you know what happened here at the end of the war , " he said , referring to reprisals against german soldiers and the german-speaking population . the czech republic was one of the last battlegrounds in world war ii , with prague the last major city to be liberated . civilia n s ofte n mixed with soldiers up to a third of the remains could be civilians . " we find soldiers and civilians together in mass graves , " kirchmeier said .
" often it is impossible to identify them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchmeier hopes heightened interest will help find a suitable cemetary the vdk had intended to bury the remains at a prague cemetery but this project was cancelled last october after it was ruled too expensive . " we tried to keep the existence of this temporary factory site secret , for security reasons , and so that we could work in a quiet atmosphere , " kirchmeier said , visibly disconcerted by the sudden publicity surrounding the remains .
" we are not very happy about this . " i n creased i n terest i n war dead one positive aspect though has been a surge in german interest about its war dead , kirchmeier said . " a lot of people have contacted us , " he said .
" they have said , for example , ' my grandfather died in russia , can you give us some information ? '
we are getting a lot of questions like this . " the vdk has responsibility for around two million german war graves from the two world wars in 830 cemeteries across europe . the publicity could also hasten the search for a final burial place for the czech remains , he added . the authority is now weighing up " six or seven offers " in the czech republic . " we hope to find a place within the next two months , but it will take another two years before we can finally bury them , " kirchmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laying germany 's war dead to rest sixty years after the end of world war ii , the remains of soldiers are still found in germany .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

while angela merkel may be happy to return to berlin , at least one family wants to stay put . while their friends and family have long left their adopted land for germany , eduard weber and his wife , nina hochweiss , chose to stay in the red-brick house in siberia they now call home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2006 german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are n't used to seeing growth going up german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .
but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .

a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced . " this is our undertaking towards the german soldiers , " said czech defense ministry spokesman jan pejsek at the factory .
" we are trying to find a solution to this affair .

they could have been the victims of reprisals by czechs as the era of german rule came to a close . " you know what happened here at the end of the war , " he said , referring to reprisals against german soldiers and the german-speaking population . the czech republic was one of the last battlegrounds in world war ii , with prague the last major city to be liberated . civilia n s ofte n mixed with soldiers up to a third of the remains could be civilians . " we find soldiers and civilians together in mass graves , " kirchmeier said .
" often it is impossible to identify them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchmeier hopes heightened interest will help find a suitable cemetary the vdk had intended to bury the remains at a prague cemetery but this project was cancelled last october after it was ruled too expensive .

" we are not very happy about this . " i n creased i n terest i n war dead one positive aspect though has been a surge in german interest about its war dead , kirchmeier said . " a lot of people have contacted us , " he said .
" they have said , for example , ' my grandfather died in russia , can you give us some information ? '
we are getting a lot of questions like this . " the vdk has responsibility for around two million german war graves from the two world wars in 830 cemeteries across europe . the publicity could also hasten the search for a final burial place for the czech remains , he added . the authority is now weighing up " six or seven offers " in the czech republic . " we hope to find a place within the next two months , but it will take another two years before we can finally bury them , " kirchmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laying germany 's war dead to rest sixty years after the end of world war ii , the remains of soldiers are still found in germany .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced . " this is our undertaking towards the german soldiers , " said czech defense ministry spokesman jan pejsek at the factory .
" we are trying to find a solution to this affair . " cause of death ofte n remai n s u n k n ow n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proper burial ceremonies will take place when a final resting place is determined the bodies of soldiers and civilians were found at sites across the czech republic over the last 10 years , the vdk spokesman fritz kirchmeier told afp , adding that 35 mass graves were discovered on czech soil . how the soldiers and civilians died in the chaos of the final days of world war ii is still a mystery in most cases , kirchmeier said .
they could have been the victims of reprisals by czechs as the era of german rule came to a close . " you know what happened here at the end of the war , " he said , referring to reprisals against german soldiers and the german-speaking population . the czech republic was one of the last battlegrounds in world war ii , with prague the last major city to be liberated . civilia n s ofte n mixed with soldiers up to a third of the remains could be civilians . " we find soldiers and civilians together in mass graves , " kirchmeier said .
" often it is impossible to identify them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchmeier hopes heightened interest will help find a suitable cemetary the vdk had intended to bury the remains at a prague cemetery but this project was cancelled last october after it was ruled too expensive . " we tried to keep the existence of this temporary factory site secret , for security reasons , and so that we could work in a quiet atmosphere , " kirchmeier said , visibly disconcerted by the sudden publicity surrounding the remains .
" we are not very happy about this . " i n creased i n terest i n war dead one positive aspect though has been a surge in german interest about its war dead , kirchmeier said . " a lot of people have contacted us , " he said .
" they have said , for example , ' my grandfather died in russia , can you give us some information ? '
we are getting a lot of questions like this . " the vdk has responsibility for around two million german war graves from the two world wars in 830 cemeteries across europe . the publicity could also hasten the search for a final burial place for the czech remains , he added . the authority is now weighing up " six or seven offers " in the czech republic .

" nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.04.2006 russia to repay debt early despite german resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in tomsk meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .
germany has so far opposed this . " this year we plan to repay in full our debt to the paris club , " vladimir putin told a russo-german business forum that he attended along with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian town of tomsk .
" we hope that germany , among other countries , can profit from our proposal . " putin did not say how much russia 's paris club debt was at present .
the paris club said in march 2005 that the russian debt stood at around $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.2 billion euros -rrb- .
russia has since repaid $ 15 billion , leaving a balance of around $ 25 billion .
the russian finance ministry in october however put the debt at $ 29.8 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is benefiting from rising gas and oil prices russia , flush with cash from soaring energy prices , has already prepaid debts to the international monetary fund and has long sought to retire the paris club debt ahead of schedule . its efforts however have so far been slowed by resistance from some creditor countries demanding that russia pay a premium to compensate them for the lost interest that early debt repayment would entail .
germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe . " the russia side underlined many times that there was no reason for worry , " said a kremlin spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow " gazprom as a company has never broken its commitments , " he added , referring to the state-controlled gas company , which had hinted it could look for customers in asia if europe does not open its market to the russian energy giant . a source in the german delegation confirmed that putin and merkel had stated their commitment to stability in energy supplies , the respect of contracts and the development of energy ties between germany and russia . putin and merkel were expected to focus on the iran nuclear crisis in their talks today before the chancellor heads back to germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin want strategic cooperation despite differences russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel met wednesday in the heart of siberia for talks on how to confront iran 's nuclear ambitions and on ways to ease anxiety about energy supply in europe .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- as merkel visits , some germans prefer to stay in siberia germany 's chancellor is making time thursday to visit ethnic germans living in siberia as part of her two-day trip to russia .
while angela merkel may be happy to return to berlin , at least one family wants to stay put .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- project fuels german fears of energy dependency on russia as german and russian leaders meet on wednesday , energy giants from both countries will close a deal on developing a russian gas field .
experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .

we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2006 german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are n't used to seeing growth going up german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .
but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes .

we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .

they failed to agree on iran . just days after officials for russia 's gas giant gazprom worried europeans by saying that they could shift energy supplies to asian markets , gazprom ceo alexei miller and jürgen hambrecht , the head of german chemicals giant basf , signed a deal to jointly develop the massive yuzhno-russkoye gas field .
the field holds enough gas to cover german demand for five to seven years . in an asset swap agreement , basf subsidiary wintershall will get 25 percent minus one share of voting rights in the gas field 's development company as well as 10 percent with no voting rights .
gazprom in return will increase its stake in wingas , a joint venture with wintershall , from 35 percent to 50 percent minus one share .
wingas sells natural gas in germany .
both companies will hold 50 percent of another joint venture called wingas europe , which distributes gas in europe outside germany . german energy giant e.on was supposed to sign a similar deal with gazprom , but this has been postponed as the two companies have not finalized negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom , e.on and basf are also jointly builing a new pipeline from russia to germany " perhaps gazprom wants assets that e.on is not willing to give up , " nils machemehl , an analyst at mm warburg , told reuters news service . " the agreement we have just signed demonstrates that russia and germany are able to build upon one another , " hambrecht said .
" it contributes to the further development of a stable and reilable partnership between gazprom and basf . " putin warns europe over energy russian president vladimir putin also hailed the deal as unprecedented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said the eu ca n't blame russians for cozying up to china " this is the first time in contemporary history that russia has allowed a foreign partner into gas production on a gigantic field , which will be exploited for decades , " he said . but putin also reiterated an earlier comment that russia would have to look for new markets if europeans started to explore alternative energy sources . " we regularly hera about the excessive dependence on russia and that russia 's delivery of energy resources to the european market should be limited , " he said .
" but understand us and see it from our position - what should we do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we will start to find other markets . " merkel : differing opinions reflecting on their meeting , german chancellor angela merkel said she and putin had " very open and intensive discussions ... often with differing opinions . " a day before the international atomic energy authority -lrb- iaea -rrb- is expected to issue a vital report on whether iran has met security council demands , merkel and putin also differed on how to proceed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's quite a bit of room between merkel 's and putin 's positions when it comes to iran while merkel said that the security council had to play an important role in dealing with tehran , putin said that the matter should stay with the iaea .

under german law , the time in which she could be charged has lapsed . bleak background the woman has told investigators that she did the babies no harm but wrapped them up and let them die after giving birth alone under the influence of large amounts of alcohol , saying she drank herself into a stupor to dull her labor pains . the prosecution wanted sabine h. to face murder charges but the court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- said the charge must be reduced to manslaughter on the grounds that the crimes took place against a background of alcohol abuse and dire family problems . the accused and her husband , who is believed to have worked for the stasi , the feared former east german secret services , divorced in 2005 after years of marital strife . dna tests have shown that the couple was indeed the parents of all nine dead newborns . they have three surviving children and the husband is said not to have wanted any more .

" this will be difficult because the findings of the investigation were inconclusive on that point , " he told afp . he said his client was painfully aware of the prison sentence she risked and of the intense interest in the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2006 nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers will discuss how to help the african union combat militias in sudan expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism are on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting thursday , but a looming iran deadline will hang over the talks . the talks in bulgaria on thursday come as iran stands firm ahead of a friday deadline set by the un security council for tehran to freeze uranium enrichment work as a " confidence-building measure . " though nato is not directly involved in the iran crisis , the meeting will provide an obvious opportunity to take stock of the situation . " i would guess a lot of them are thinking about what happens if this deadline passes without a change of heart from the iranians , " a senior nato diplomat told the afp news agency . " nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union . " nato stands ready to extend our support and change the foundation of our mission there to include capacity building for a joint operations center , " scheffer said , adding nato would also be willing to help train troops headed to darfur .
" we are not talking about a nato force on the ground in darfur . " a request from the african union would be required before nato could increase its engagement in darfur .
that is currently being blocked by the sudanese government , which is also blocking un diplomats from entering darfur to evaluate conditions for a un peacekeeping force . slowi n g nato expa n sio n prolonging the expansion process for new nato members without ruffling any feathers seems to be scheffer 's plan for dealing with the alliance 's internal affairs . " this is a discussion which is starting now in sofia , " he said , avoiding any particulars on whether croatia , macedonia , albania , ukraine and georgia would be admitted to the alliance .
" it is clear that nato 's door is open , that nato supports reforms , but this is , as far as the aspirants are concerned , the important beginning of a discussion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussions on getting inside nato 's gates are just beginning scheffer added that expected a signal would be sent to the aspirant countries but admitted he did not know what that signal would be before the talks conclude . under pressure from the united states , the ministers will also address spreading the alliance farther to include anti-terrorism cooperation with asian and pacific countries . australia , japan , new zeeland and south korea have all expressed interest in closer ties with the brussels-based alliance , but scheffer said enhanced cooperation with the nations would not turn nato into a global entity . " this is not making nato into a global alliance , but it is making nato into an alliance with global partners because the threats and challenges are of a global nature , " he said . some nato members , including germany , france and poland , had expressed their concern about expanding the north atlantic treaty organization over too large an area . bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2006 german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are n't used to seeing growth going up german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .
but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .
" however , despite the positive signals on the job market , an increase in employment is not visible .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in the west of the country .
" we will not bow to injustice and pressure .
if they want to attack the rights of the iranian people , we will stamp shame and regret on them . " iran insists it has a right to enrich to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make nuclear weapons .
western powers , led by the united states , are convinced iran is seeking either a nuclear bomb or the " strategic capacity " to make one . iran 's refusal to freeze enrichment by friday in line with last month 's un security council demand opens the door to sanctions , despite opposition from russia and china .
the united states has also not ruled out taking military action . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , was scheduled to release a report friday on iranian compliance .
senior diplomats from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany are due to discuss the next steps in a meeting in paris on tuesday , although ahmadinejad showed no sign of worry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad insists he only wants to use nuclear power in a peaceful way " they think that by frowning , adopting resolutions and going from one organization to the other , they can hide their horrible face and unjust decisions behind the agency and the security council and make us back down , " he said .
" we have obtained nuclear fuel technology by ourselves , and nobody can deprive us of it . " ahmadinejad also took a fresh swipe at israel by complaining that germany was being exploited by " greedy zionists " more than 60 years after world war ii . " look at the german people .
three generations ago , there was a war .
but today an intelligent people is still a hostage of world war ii , " he said in a speech carried on state television . germany , he said , " still does n't have the right to have independent policies or proper defences . " " every german born is indebted to the arrogant and greedy zionists , " ahmadinejad said , referring to german reparations for the holocaust . " when you visit a country , in every town there is a symbol of national pride , " ahmadinejad said , but added that in germany " every town has something saying to the great german people that their parent and grandparents were murderers . " last-minute talks fail last-minute talks between iran 's nuclear chief gholam reza aghazadeh and iaea director mohamed elbaradei on wednesday failed to make any headway , diplomats said . one diplomat said aghazadeh simply " just rattled around on iran 's previously stated positions .
he did not propose anything new . " the white house has warned the country was facing further international isolation after supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei threatened global retaliation to any american military action . iran has already warned that sanctions could force it to halt cooperation with the iaea or even quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . china , russia oppose action in beijing , chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang issued an appeal for calm . " we indeed think the iranian nuclear issue is at a crucial stage , " he said .
" we hope all parties concerned can keep calm , exercise restraint and create favorable conditions so as to properly resolve this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and china do n't want to take action in the security council russian president vladimir putin also said the iaea needed to continue playing a key role in the crisis - signaling his reluctance to see the matter fully referred to the security council . " it is too early to run ahead and say what decisions we might take together , " he said during a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian city of tomsk .
" the main thing is that any decisions that are made must be made in agreement . " merkel , whose country is iran 's largest european trading partner , also called for a diplomatic resolution to the standoff . nato dinner talk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaking in the bulgarian capital sofia , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer voiced concerns . " although it is not playing the first violin , what happens there -lrb- in iran -rrb- is a very nato-relevant subject , " he said as he prepared to host talks among the alliance 's foreign ministers including us secretary of state condoleezza rice .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in the west of the country .
" we will not bow to injustice and pressure .
if they want to attack the rights of the iranian people , we will stamp shame and regret on them . " iran insists it has a right to enrich to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make nuclear weapons .
western powers , led by the united states , are convinced iran is seeking either a nuclear bomb or the " strategic capacity " to make one . iran 's refusal to freeze enrichment by friday in line with last month 's un security council demand opens the door to sanctions , despite opposition from russia and china .
the united states has also not ruled out taking military action . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , was scheduled to release a report friday on iranian compliance .
senior diplomats from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany are due to discuss the next steps in a meeting in paris on tuesday , although ahmadinejad showed no sign of worry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad insists he only wants to use nuclear power in a peaceful way " they think that by frowning , adopting resolutions and going from one organization to the other , they can hide their horrible face and unjust decisions behind the agency and the security council and make us back down , " he said .
" we have obtained nuclear fuel technology by ourselves , and nobody can deprive us of it . " ahmadinejad also took a fresh swipe at israel by complaining that germany was being exploited by " greedy zionists " more than 60 years after world war ii . " look at the german people .
three generations ago , there was a war .
but today an intelligent people is still a hostage of world war ii , " he said in a speech carried on state television . germany , he said , " still does n't have the right to have independent policies or proper defences . " " every german born is indebted to the arrogant and greedy zionists , " ahmadinejad said , referring to german reparations for the holocaust . " when you visit a country , in every town there is a symbol of national pride , " ahmadinejad said , but added that in germany " every town has something saying to the great german people that their parent and grandparents were murderers . " last-minute talks fail last-minute talks between iran 's nuclear chief gholam reza aghazadeh and iaea director mohamed elbaradei on wednesday failed to make any headway , diplomats said . one diplomat said aghazadeh simply " just rattled around on iran 's previously stated positions .
he did not propose anything new . " the white house has warned the country was facing further international isolation after supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei threatened global retaliation to any american military action . iran has already warned that sanctions could force it to halt cooperation with the iaea or even quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . china , russia oppose action in beijing , chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang issued an appeal for calm . " we indeed think the iranian nuclear issue is at a crucial stage , " he said .
" we hope all parties concerned can keep calm , exercise restraint and create favorable conditions so as to properly resolve this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and china do n't want to take action in the security council russian president vladimir putin also said the iaea needed to continue playing a key role in the crisis - signaling his reluctance to see the matter fully referred to the security council . " it is too early to run ahead and say what decisions we might take together , " he said during a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian city of tomsk .
" the main thing is that any decisions that are made must be made in agreement . " merkel , whose country is iran 's largest european trading partner , also called for a diplomatic resolution to the standoff . nato dinner talk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaking in the bulgarian capital sofia , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer voiced concerns . " although it is not playing the first violin , what happens there -lrb- in iran -rrb- is a very nato-relevant subject , " he said as he prepared to host talks among the alliance 's foreign ministers including us secretary of state condoleezza rice .

while angela merkel may be happy to return to berlin , at least one family wants to stay put . while their friends and family have long left their adopted land for germany , eduard weber and his wife , nina hochweiss , chose to stay in the red-brick house in siberia they now call home . " my brothers , my sisters , their children - everyone 's gone , " said weber , 69 , one of 900 russians of german origin still living in kozhevnikovo , a tidy farming village surrounded by a birch forest that 's situated about 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from tomsk , where merkel and russian president vladimir putin are meeting . germany remains far away for weber and hochweiss , who tend a vegetable garden and keep pigs and poultry to supplement their combined pension of just over 200 euros -lrb- $ 249 -rrb- per month . " that 's the homeland of my ancestors , " said eduard , a former state farm engineer who visited germany for the first time in 1998 .
" my homeland is russia .

" i used to live in saratov , " weber said .
" my father was a manager at a collective farm .
we had to leave in 24 hours with some things in a bundle , " eduard said . for the family home he lost and the years when he was forced to " live on frozen potatoes , " eduard said he has received compensation from the russian government of 250 euros . struggli n g to adjust i n germa n y about 2.5 million ethnic germans emigrated from russia during the 1980s and 1990s .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced . " this is our undertaking towards the german soldiers , " said czech defense ministry spokesman jan pejsek at the factory .
" we are trying to find a solution to this affair . " cause of death ofte n remai n s u n k n ow n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proper burial ceremonies will take place when a final resting place is determined the bodies of soldiers and civilians were found at sites across the czech republic over the last 10 years , the vdk spokesman fritz kirchmeier told afp , adding that 35 mass graves were discovered on czech soil . how the soldiers and civilians died in the chaos of the final days of world war ii is still a mystery in most cases , kirchmeier said .
they could have been the victims of reprisals by czechs as the era of german rule came to a close . " you know what happened here at the end of the war , " he said , referring to reprisals against german soldiers and the german-speaking population . the czech republic was one of the last battlegrounds in world war ii , with prague the last major city to be liberated . civilia n s ofte n mixed with soldiers up to a third of the remains could be civilians . " we find soldiers and civilians together in mass graves , " kirchmeier said .
" often it is impossible to identify them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchmeier hopes heightened interest will help find a suitable cemetary the vdk had intended to bury the remains at a prague cemetery but this project was cancelled last october after it was ruled too expensive . " we tried to keep the existence of this temporary factory site secret , for security reasons , and so that we could work in a quiet atmosphere , " kirchmeier said , visibly disconcerted by the sudden publicity surrounding the remains .
" we are not very happy about this . " i n creased i n terest i n war dead one positive aspect though has been a surge in german interest about its war dead , kirchmeier said . " a lot of people have contacted us , " he said .
" they have said , for example , ' my grandfather died in russia , can you give us some information ? '
we are getting a lot of questions like this . " the vdk has responsibility for around two million german war graves from the two world wars in 830 cemeteries across europe . the publicity could also hasten the search for a final burial place for the czech remains , he added . the authority is now weighing up " six or seven offers " in the czech republic . " we hope to find a place within the next two months , but it will take another two years before we can finally bury them , " kirchmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laying germany 's war dead to rest sixty years after the end of world war ii , the remains of soldiers are still found in germany .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced . " this is our undertaking towards the german soldiers , " said czech defense ministry spokesman jan pejsek at the factory .
" we are trying to find a solution to this affair . " cause of death ofte n remai n s u n k n ow n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proper burial ceremonies will take place when a final resting place is determined the bodies of soldiers and civilians were found at sites across the czech republic over the last 10 years , the vdk spokesman fritz kirchmeier told afp , adding that 35 mass graves were discovered on czech soil . how the soldiers and civilians died in the chaos of the final days of world war ii is still a mystery in most cases , kirchmeier said .
they could have been the victims of reprisals by czechs as the era of german rule came to a close . " you know what happened here at the end of the war , " he said , referring to reprisals against german soldiers and the german-speaking population . the czech republic was one of the last battlegrounds in world war ii , with prague the last major city to be liberated . civilia n s ofte n mixed with soldiers up to a third of the remains could be civilians . " we find soldiers and civilians together in mass graves , " kirchmeier said .
" often it is impossible to identify them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchmeier hopes heightened interest will help find a suitable cemetary the vdk had intended to bury the remains at a prague cemetery but this project was cancelled last october after it was ruled too expensive . " we tried to keep the existence of this temporary factory site secret , for security reasons , and so that we could work in a quiet atmosphere , " kirchmeier said , visibly disconcerted by the sudden publicity surrounding the remains .
" we are not very happy about this . " i n creased i n terest i n war dead one positive aspect though has been a surge in german interest about its war dead , kirchmeier said . " a lot of people have contacted us , " he said .
" they have said , for example , ' my grandfather died in russia , can you give us some information ? '
we are getting a lot of questions like this . " the vdk has responsibility for around two million german war graves from the two world wars in 830 cemeteries across europe . the publicity could also hasten the search for a final burial place for the czech remains , he added . the authority is now weighing up " six or seven offers " in the czech republic .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2006 " we greatly value our relationship with germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamal nath : " everybody 's given a fair chance in india " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy . how was your meeting with the new german chancellor angela merkel during the hanover fair ? i 've known angela merkel since the early 1990s .
she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

" though nato is not directly involved in the iran crisis , the meeting will provide an obvious opportunity to take stock of the situation . " i would guess a lot of them are thinking about what happens if this deadline passes without a change of heart from the iranians , " a senior nato diplomat told the afp news agency . " nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union . " nato stands ready to extend our support and change the foundation of our mission there to include capacity building for a joint operations center , " scheffer said , adding nato would also be willing to help train troops headed to darfur .
" we are not talking about a nato force on the ground in darfur . " a request from the african union would be required before nato could increase its engagement in darfur .
that is currently being blocked by the sudanese government , which is also blocking un diplomats from entering darfur to evaluate conditions for a un peacekeeping force . slowi n g nato expa n sio n prolonging the expansion process for new nato members without ruffling any feathers seems to be scheffer 's plan for dealing with the alliance 's internal affairs . " this is a discussion which is starting now in sofia , " he said , avoiding any particulars on whether croatia , macedonia , albania , ukraine and georgia would be admitted to the alliance .
" it is clear that nato 's door is open , that nato supports reforms , but this is , as far as the aspirants are concerned , the important beginning of a discussion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussions on getting inside nato 's gates are just beginning scheffer added that expected a signal would be sent to the aspirant countries but admitted he did not know what that signal would be before the talks conclude . under pressure from the united states , the ministers will also address spreading the alliance farther to include anti-terrorism cooperation with asian and pacific countries . australia , japan , new zeeland and south korea have all expressed interest in closer ties with the brussels-based alliance , but scheffer said enhanced cooperation with the nations would not turn nato into a global entity . " this is not making nato into a global alliance , but it is making nato into an alliance with global partners because the threats and challenges are of a global nature , " he said . some nato members , including germany , france and poland , had expressed their concern about expanding the north atlantic treaty organization over too large an area . bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

germany has so far opposed this . " this year we plan to repay in full our debt to the paris club , " vladimir putin told a russo-german business forum that he attended along with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian town of tomsk .
" we hope that germany , among other countries , can profit from our proposal . " putin did not say how much russia 's paris club debt was at present .
the paris club said in march 2005 that the russian debt stood at around $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.2 billion euros -rrb- .
russia has since repaid $ 15 billion , leaving a balance of around $ 25 billion .
the russian finance ministry in october however put the debt at $ 29.8 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is benefiting from rising gas and oil prices russia , flush with cash from soaring energy prices , has already prepaid debts to the international monetary fund and has long sought to retire the paris club debt ahead of schedule . its efforts however have so far been slowed by resistance from some creditor countries demanding that russia pay a premium to compensate them for the lost interest that early debt repayment would entail .
germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe . " the russia side underlined many times that there was no reason for worry , " said a kremlin spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow " gazprom as a company has never broken its commitments , " he added , referring to the state-controlled gas company , which had hinted it could look for customers in asia if europe does not open its market to the russian energy giant . a source in the german delegation confirmed that putin and merkel had stated their commitment to stability in energy supplies , the respect of contracts and the development of energy ties between germany and russia . putin and merkel were expected to focus on the iran nuclear crisis in their talks today before the chancellor heads back to germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin want strategic cooperation despite differences russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel met wednesday in the heart of siberia for talks on how to confront iran 's nuclear ambitions and on ways to ease anxiety about energy supply in europe .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced .

they could have been the victims of reprisals by czechs as the era of german rule came to a close . " you know what happened here at the end of the war , " he said , referring to reprisals against german soldiers and the german-speaking population . the czech republic was one of the last battlegrounds in world war ii , with prague the last major city to be liberated . civilia n s ofte n mixed with soldiers up to a third of the remains could be civilians . " we find soldiers and civilians together in mass graves , " kirchmeier said .

" they have said , for example , ' my grandfather died in russia , can you give us some information ? '
we are getting a lot of questions like this . " the vdk has responsibility for around two million german war graves from the two world wars in 830 cemeteries across europe . the publicity could also hasten the search for a final burial place for the czech remains , he added . the authority is now weighing up " six or seven offers " in the czech republic .

germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .

they failed to agree on iran . just days after officials for russia 's gas giant gazprom worried europeans by saying that they could shift energy supplies to asian markets , gazprom ceo alexei miller and jürgen hambrecht , the head of german chemicals giant basf , signed a deal to jointly develop the massive yuzhno-russkoye gas field .
the field holds enough gas to cover german demand for five to seven years . in an asset swap agreement , basf subsidiary wintershall will get 25 percent minus one share of voting rights in the gas field 's development company as well as 10 percent with no voting rights .
gazprom in return will increase its stake in wingas , a joint venture with wintershall , from 35 percent to 50 percent minus one share .
wingas sells natural gas in germany .
both companies will hold 50 percent of another joint venture called wingas europe , which distributes gas in europe outside germany . german energy giant e.on was supposed to sign a similar deal with gazprom , but this has been postponed as the two companies have not finalized negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom , e.on and basf are also jointly builing a new pipeline from russia to germany " perhaps gazprom wants assets that e.on is not willing to give up , " nils machemehl , an analyst at mm warburg , told reuters news service . " the agreement we have just signed demonstrates that russia and germany are able to build upon one another , " hambrecht said .
" it contributes to the further development of a stable and reilable partnership between gazprom and basf . " putin warns europe over energy russian president vladimir putin also hailed the deal as unprecedented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said the eu ca n't blame russians for cozying up to china " this is the first time in contemporary history that russia has allowed a foreign partner into gas production on a gigantic field , which will be exploited for decades , " he said . but putin also reiterated an earlier comment that russia would have to look for new markets if europeans started to explore alternative energy sources . " we regularly hera about the excessive dependence on russia and that russia 's delivery of energy resources to the european market should be limited , " he said .
" but understand us and see it from our position - what should we do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we will start to find other markets . " merkel : differing opinions reflecting on their meeting , german chancellor angela merkel said she and putin had " very open and intensive discussions ... often with differing opinions . " a day before the international atomic energy authority -lrb- iaea -rrb- is expected to issue a vital report on whether iran has met security council demands , merkel and putin also differed on how to proceed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's quite a bit of room between merkel 's and putin 's positions when it comes to iran while merkel said that the security council had to play an important role in dealing with tehran , putin said that the matter should stay with the iaea . " we think that the iaea must continue to play a major , key role and it must not shrug off its responsibilites to resolve such questions and shift them onto the un security council , " he said . russia , along with china , opposes sanctions against iran . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia to repay debt early despite german resistance meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2006 nato foreign ministers discuss darfur , expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers will discuss how to help the african union combat militias in sudan expansion of the military alliance and cooperation with other states to fight terrorism are on the agenda for nato foreign ministers during their meeting thursday , but a looming iran deadline will hang over the talks . the talks in bulgaria on thursday come as iran stands firm ahead of a friday deadline set by the un security council for tehran to freeze uranium enrichment work as a " confidence-building measure . " though nato is not directly involved in the iran crisis , the meeting will provide an obvious opportunity to take stock of the situation . " i would guess a lot of them are thinking about what happens if this deadline passes without a change of heart from the iranians , " a senior nato diplomat told the afp news agency . " nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union . " nato stands ready to extend our support and change the foundation of our mission there to include capacity building for a joint operations center , " scheffer said , adding nato would also be willing to help train troops headed to darfur .
" we are not talking about a nato force on the ground in darfur . " a request from the african union would be required before nato could increase its engagement in darfur .
that is currently being blocked by the sudanese government , which is also blocking un diplomats from entering darfur to evaluate conditions for a un peacekeeping force . slowi n g nato expa n sio n prolonging the expansion process for new nato members without ruffling any feathers seems to be scheffer 's plan for dealing with the alliance 's internal affairs . " this is a discussion which is starting now in sofia , " he said , avoiding any particulars on whether croatia , macedonia , albania , ukraine and georgia would be admitted to the alliance .
" it is clear that nato 's door is open , that nato supports reforms , but this is , as far as the aspirants are concerned , the important beginning of a discussion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussions on getting inside nato 's gates are just beginning scheffer added that expected a signal would be sent to the aspirant countries but admitted he did not know what that signal would be before the talks conclude . under pressure from the united states , the ministers will also address spreading the alliance farther to include anti-terrorism cooperation with asian and pacific countries . australia , japan , new zeeland and south korea have all expressed interest in closer ties with the brussels-based alliance , but scheffer said enhanced cooperation with the nations would not turn nato into a global entity . " this is not making nato into a global alliance , but it is making nato into an alliance with global partners because the threats and challenges are of a global nature , " he said . some nato members , including germany , france and poland , had expressed their concern about expanding the north atlantic treaty organization over too large an area . bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .

a young team of world and european champions .
then it all fell apart in 2002 and failed to get much better in 2004 .
could 2006 see france return to the top of the heap ? world cup qualifiers the french team 's qualification was more grueling than glamorous .
france started off as the favorite in group 4 .
but the world champions from 1998 made a bit of a rough job stumbling through the qualifiers .
only when the " retired " stars zidane , makelele and thuram could be convinced to slip over their international jerseys again did things fall into place .
with a 4:0 home victory against cyprus , the french team 's qualification was perfect . stars zinedine zidane is the shining light of french soccer and has been elected world player of the year three times .
in august 2004 , he retired from the international team .
but one year later , he returned to the field when the french team was threatening to fail the world cup qualifiers .
his elegant technique and brilliant play is supposed to now also lead the " equipe tricolore " to success at the world cup in germany .
the cutting edge of the team will be provided by one of the world 's best strikers , thierry henry . trainer trainer raymond domenech has high goals .

germany has so far opposed this . " this year we plan to repay in full our debt to the paris club , " vladimir putin told a russo-german business forum that he attended along with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian town of tomsk .
" we hope that germany , among other countries , can profit from our proposal . " putin did not say how much russia 's paris club debt was at present .
the paris club said in march 2005 that the russian debt stood at around $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.2 billion euros -rrb- .

germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe .

the remains , which were moved to a military training base west of prague on wednesday , were then stashed away for eight years in the factory while german authorities worked to relocate them . the cardboard coffins were " discovered " in the northern czech industrial city of usti nad labem by the local press last month , sparking a political outcry in the czech republic as well as germany , with the mass-market bild newspaper calling the situation a " scandal . " the czech army and the german war graves authority , volksbu n d deutsche kriegsgräberfürsorge -lrb- vdk -rrb- , signed an agreement monday allowing the remains to be stored at the military base until 2008 - although a final resting spot has not yet been announced . " this is our undertaking towards the german soldiers , " said czech defense ministry spokesman jan pejsek at the factory .
" we are trying to find a solution to this affair . " cause of death ofte n remai n s u n k n ow n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proper burial ceremonies will take place when a final resting place is determined the bodies of soldiers and civilians were found at sites across the czech republic over the last 10 years , the vdk spokesman fritz kirchmeier told afp , adding that 35 mass graves were discovered on czech soil . how the soldiers and civilians died in the chaos of the final days of world war ii is still a mystery in most cases , kirchmeier said .
they could have been the victims of reprisals by czechs as the era of german rule came to a close . " you know what happened here at the end of the war , " he said , referring to reprisals against german soldiers and the german-speaking population . the czech republic was one of the last battlegrounds in world war ii , with prague the last major city to be liberated . civilia n s ofte n mixed with soldiers up to a third of the remains could be civilians . " we find soldiers and civilians together in mass graves , " kirchmeier said .

" i would guess a lot of them are thinking about what happens if this deadline passes without a change of heart from the iranians , " a senior nato diplomat told the afp news agency . " nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union .

" this is not making nato into a global alliance , but it is making nato into an alliance with global partners because the threats and challenges are of a global nature , " he said . some nato members , including germany , france and poland , had expressed their concern about expanding the north atlantic treaty organization over too large an area . bernd riegert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the stronger the eu forces become , the better " in an interview with dw-world.de , victoria nuland , us permanent representative to nato , spoke about the ongoing activities of the north atlantic treaty organization as well as plans for its future expansion .

" though nato is not directly involved in the iran crisis , the meeting will provide an obvious opportunity to take stock of the situation . " i would guess a lot of them are thinking about what happens if this deadline passes without a change of heart from the iranians , " a senior nato diplomat told the afp news agency . " nato is concerned by the issue , but it is not playing a leading role , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said . scheffer , who will be leading the nato talks , already has enough on his plate with the official agenda for the informal sofia meeting , including discussion of darfur , as well as preparations for a nato summit in the latvian capital riga in november . nato support for darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer made it clear that nato would not send soldiers to sudan the alliance has said it is ready to increase its logistical support for an african union-led peacekeeping force in the violence-scarred sudanese region , as well as for a un force expected to replace it later in the year . intense discussions are underway between the governments of nato 's 26 member states over how exactly this can be done without actually sending combat troops into the region .
united nations secretary general kofi annan requested nato expand its support to the african union . " nato stands ready to extend our support and change the foundation of our mission there to include capacity building for a joint operations center , " scheffer said , adding nato would also be willing to help train troops headed to darfur .
" we are not talking about a nato force on the ground in darfur . " a request from the african union would be required before nato could increase its engagement in darfur .
that is currently being blocked by the sudanese government , which is also blocking un diplomats from entering darfur to evaluate conditions for a un peacekeeping force . slowi n g nato expa n sio n prolonging the expansion process for new nato members without ruffling any feathers seems to be scheffer 's plan for dealing with the alliance 's internal affairs . " this is a discussion which is starting now in sofia , " he said , avoiding any particulars on whether croatia , macedonia , albania , ukraine and georgia would be admitted to the alliance .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .

india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .

russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .

germany has so far opposed this . " this year we plan to repay in full our debt to the paris club , " vladimir putin told a russo-german business forum that he attended along with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian town of tomsk .
" we hope that germany , among other countries , can profit from our proposal . " putin did not say how much russia 's paris club debt was at present .
the paris club said in march 2005 that the russian debt stood at around $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.2 billion euros -rrb- .

germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe . " the russia side underlined many times that there was no reason for worry , " said a kremlin spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow " gazprom as a company has never broken its commitments , " he added , referring to the state-controlled gas company , which had hinted it could look for customers in asia if europe does not open its market to the russian energy giant . a source in the german delegation confirmed that putin and merkel had stated their commitment to stability in energy supplies , the respect of contracts and the development of energy ties between germany and russia . putin and merkel were expected to focus on the iran nuclear crisis in their talks today before the chancellor heads back to germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin want strategic cooperation despite differences russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel met wednesday in the heart of siberia for talks on how to confront iran 's nuclear ambitions and on ways to ease anxiety about energy supply in europe .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes . " as we expected , the usual spring upturn has come later this year because of the cold march , " agency head frank-jürgen weise said .

but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge . exports and domestic demand , coupled with new investment and low interest rates are giving europe 's largest economy a " heavy push , " according to a report from the group of six research institutes announced in berlin on thursday . " in the spring of 2006 , the german economy is in the middle of a strong upturn , " the institutes wrote .
while in autumn of last year they expected the german economy to expand by merely 1.2 percent , they now see growth climbing to 1.8 percent . joachim scheide , chief economist at the kiel-based institute of global economics says germany is growing in the wake of robust global expansion and a jump in domestic consumption partly spurred on by the policies of chancellor angela merkel . " we see that the current conditions continue to be good and that the indicators are booming especially as far as services are concerned .
we also see a pick-up in new orders and industrial production , " scheide said . " the general mood is also positive because of a set of new measures by the government .
so investment is stimulated by government programs and there are advanced purchases of goods because of the planned hike in vat at the beginning of next year . " the data forecasts a 2.9 percent , below the european union ' limit of 3 percent of the gdp .
germany has been over the limit since 2002 . the institutes , however , also warned that despite the 1.8 percent growth , a virtual doubling as compared to last year , it may not be the massive turnaround many in germany are hoping for , adding that they expect the gross domestic product to fall to 1.2 percent in 2007 . changes to coalition tax plans suggested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are buying expensive goods before merkel raises the value-added tax while praising the government for giving budgetary discipline a high priority , the researchers said more needed to be done to lower spending , calling higher taxes " the wrong path to take . " the report also recommended chancellor angela merkel alter her plan to increase the value-added tax by 3 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of next year . the report , written by members of the ifw in kiel , the diw in berlin , the hwwa in hamburg , the ifo in munich , the iwh in halle and the rwi in essen , suggested a two-step solution to ease businesses ' tax burden with an initial increase of 2 percent in 2007 and an additional 1 percent in 2008 . improvements in domestic consumer confidence , long a german predicament , were partly attributable to the planned vat rise , with households bringing forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the increase .
spending is likely to decline again after the tax jump , the institutes warned . " the economy will lose momentum notably next year , " they wrote .
" domestic demand will be dampened by a much more restrictive fiscal policy . " no major relief for labor market yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institutes do n't expect a major drop in the number of unemployed reaching for a number the economic upsurge , however , is not predicted to bring a spate of new jobs with it .
a moderate drop in unemployment of about 300,000 to 4.58 percent is expected by the end of the year , a number predicted to drop moderately to 4.44 million in 2007 , according to the report . earlier on thursday , the federal labor agency announced a drop in unemployment as 187,000 people were hired in march , bringing the jobless rate down 4.79 million or 12 percent , but proved to be less optimistic than the six institutes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.04.2006 russia to repay debt early despite german resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel in tomsk meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .
germany has so far opposed this . " this year we plan to repay in full our debt to the paris club , " vladimir putin told a russo-german business forum that he attended along with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian town of tomsk .
" we hope that germany , among other countries , can profit from our proposal . " putin did not say how much russia 's paris club debt was at present .
the paris club said in march 2005 that the russian debt stood at around $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.2 billion euros -rrb- .
russia has since repaid $ 15 billion , leaving a balance of around $ 25 billion .
the russian finance ministry in october however put the debt at $ 29.8 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is benefiting from rising gas and oil prices russia , flush with cash from soaring energy prices , has already prepaid debts to the international monetary fund and has long sought to retire the paris club debt ahead of schedule . its efforts however have so far been slowed by resistance from some creditor countries demanding that russia pay a premium to compensate them for the lost interest that early debt repayment would entail .
germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe . " the russia side underlined many times that there was no reason for worry , " said a kremlin spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow " gazprom as a company has never broken its commitments , " he added , referring to the state-controlled gas company , which had hinted it could look for customers in asia if europe does not open its market to the russian energy giant . a source in the german delegation confirmed that putin and merkel had stated their commitment to stability in energy supplies , the respect of contracts and the development of energy ties between germany and russia . putin and merkel were expected to focus on the iran nuclear crisis in their talks today before the chancellor heads back to germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin want strategic cooperation despite differences russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel met wednesday in the heart of siberia for talks on how to confront iran 's nuclear ambitions and on ways to ease anxiety about energy supply in europe .

under german law , the time in which she could be charged has lapsed . bleak background the woman has told investigators that she did the babies no harm but wrapped them up and let them die after giving birth alone under the influence of large amounts of alcohol , saying she drank herself into a stupor to dull her labor pains . the prosecution wanted sabine h. to face murder charges but the court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- said the charge must be reduced to manslaughter on the grounds that the crimes took place against a background of alcohol abuse and dire family problems . the accused and her husband , who is believed to have worked for the stasi , the feared former east german secret services , divorced in 2005 after years of marital strife . dna tests have shown that the couple was indeed the parents of all nine dead newborns . they have three surviving children and the husband is said not to have wanted any more .
the woman also has a two-year-old child by another man . neighbor discovered remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remains were discovered in a garage in brieskow-finkenheerd she was arrested last year after a neighbor of her parents in the small town of brieskow-finkenheerd came across the remains of the babies in july while cleaning up their garage . according to prosecutor annette bargenda , sabine h. kept two of the babies in a freezer for years before placing them in a flower pot , which she kept on her balcony for a while before moving it to her parents ' property . bargenda said the accused repeatedly fell pregnant because she refused to use contraception out of religious conviction . it was discovered while she was in preventive custody that she is suffering from a serious form of cancer . her lawyer , matthias schöneburg , said the court will have to prove that the babies were alive at birth . " this will be difficult because the findings of the investigation were inconclusive on that point , " he told afp . he said his client was painfully aware of the prison sentence she risked and of the intense interest in the case . " but she is relieved that the trial is starting and that she will know her fate in a month 's time , " he said . a verdict is expected at the end of may . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de details about baby killings emerge a woman from eastern germany who allegedly murdered her nine newborn babies has given details on the deaths to authorities investigating the suspected killings , a german prosecutor said saturday .

germany has so far opposed this . " this year we plan to repay in full our debt to the paris club , " vladimir putin told a russo-german business forum that he attended along with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian town of tomsk .
" we hope that germany , among other countries , can profit from our proposal . " putin did not say how much russia 's paris club debt was at present .
the paris club said in march 2005 that the russian debt stood at around $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.2 billion euros -rrb- .
russia has since repaid $ 15 billion , leaving a balance of around $ 25 billion .
the russian finance ministry in october however put the debt at $ 29.8 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is benefiting from rising gas and oil prices russia , flush with cash from soaring energy prices , has already prepaid debts to the international monetary fund and has long sought to retire the paris club debt ahead of schedule . its efforts however have so far been slowed by resistance from some creditor countries demanding that russia pay a premium to compensate them for the lost interest that early debt repayment would entail .
germany , which converted around $ 7 billion of russian debt into government bonds , has in particular resisted russia 's offers to prepay the paris club debt . putin said however that last august russia reimbursed a $ 15 billion chunk of debt to the paris club , including around $ 6 billion to germany . " it appears this strengthened trust among german business groups in their russian partners , " putin said .
it was unclear if putin 's proposal signaled that germany had endorsed the debt prepayment initiative . putin : russia will stick to gas deliveries putin meanwhile reassured merkel that russia would stand by its commitments to supply gas to europe . " the russia side underlined many times that there was no reason for worry , " said a kremlin spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow " gazprom as a company has never broken its commitments , " he added , referring to the state-controlled gas company , which had hinted it could look for customers in asia if europe does not open its market to the russian energy giant . a source in the german delegation confirmed that putin and merkel had stated their commitment to stability in energy supplies , the respect of contracts and the development of energy ties between germany and russia . putin and merkel were expected to focus on the iran nuclear crisis in their talks today before the chancellor heads back to germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin want strategic cooperation despite differences russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel met wednesday in the heart of siberia for talks on how to confront iran 's nuclear ambitions and on ways to ease anxiety about energy supply in europe .

they failed to agree on iran . just days after officials for russia 's gas giant gazprom worried europeans by saying that they could shift energy supplies to asian markets , gazprom ceo alexei miller and jürgen hambrecht , the head of german chemicals giant basf , signed a deal to jointly develop the massive yuzhno-russkoye gas field .
the field holds enough gas to cover german demand for five to seven years . in an asset swap agreement , basf subsidiary wintershall will get 25 percent minus one share of voting rights in the gas field 's development company as well as 10 percent with no voting rights .
gazprom in return will increase its stake in wingas , a joint venture with wintershall , from 35 percent to 50 percent minus one share .
wingas sells natural gas in germany .
both companies will hold 50 percent of another joint venture called wingas europe , which distributes gas in europe outside germany . german energy giant e.on was supposed to sign a similar deal with gazprom , but this has been postponed as the two companies have not finalized negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom , e.on and basf are also jointly builing a new pipeline from russia to germany " perhaps gazprom wants assets that e.on is not willing to give up , " nils machemehl , an analyst at mm warburg , told reuters news service . " the agreement we have just signed demonstrates that russia and germany are able to build upon one another , " hambrecht said .
" it contributes to the further development of a stable and reilable partnership between gazprom and basf . " putin warns europe over energy russian president vladimir putin also hailed the deal as unprecedented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said the eu ca n't blame russians for cozying up to china " this is the first time in contemporary history that russia has allowed a foreign partner into gas production on a gigantic field , which will be exploited for decades , " he said . but putin also reiterated an earlier comment that russia would have to look for new markets if europeans started to explore alternative energy sources . " we regularly hera about the excessive dependence on russia and that russia 's delivery of energy resources to the european market should be limited , " he said .
" but understand us and see it from our position - what should we do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we will start to find other markets . " merkel : differing opinions reflecting on their meeting , german chancellor angela merkel said she and putin had " very open and intensive discussions ... often with differing opinions . " a day before the international atomic energy authority -lrb- iaea -rrb- is expected to issue a vital report on whether iran has met security council demands , merkel and putin also differed on how to proceed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's quite a bit of room between merkel 's and putin 's positions when it comes to iran while merkel said that the security council had to play an important role in dealing with tehran , putin said that the matter should stay with the iaea . " we think that the iaea must continue to play a major , key role and it must not shrug off its responsibilites to resolve such questions and shift them onto the un security council , " he said . russia , along with china , opposes sanctions against iran . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia to repay debt early despite german resistance meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " ahmadinejad said in a speech in the west of the country .
" we will not bow to injustice and pressure .
if they want to attack the rights of the iranian people , we will stamp shame and regret on them . " iran insists it has a right to enrich to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make nuclear weapons .
western powers , led by the united states , are convinced iran is seeking either a nuclear bomb or the " strategic capacity " to make one . iran 's refusal to freeze enrichment by friday in line with last month 's un security council demand opens the door to sanctions , despite opposition from russia and china .
the united states has also not ruled out taking military action . the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , was scheduled to release a report friday on iranian compliance .
senior diplomats from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany are due to discuss the next steps in a meeting in paris on tuesday , although ahmadinejad showed no sign of worry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad insists he only wants to use nuclear power in a peaceful way " they think that by frowning , adopting resolutions and going from one organization to the other , they can hide their horrible face and unjust decisions behind the agency and the security council and make us back down , " he said .
" we have obtained nuclear fuel technology by ourselves , and nobody can deprive us of it . " ahmadinejad also took a fresh swipe at israel by complaining that germany was being exploited by " greedy zionists " more than 60 years after world war ii . " look at the german people .
three generations ago , there was a war .
but today an intelligent people is still a hostage of world war ii , " he said in a speech carried on state television . germany , he said , " still does n't have the right to have independent policies or proper defences . " " every german born is indebted to the arrogant and greedy zionists , " ahmadinejad said , referring to german reparations for the holocaust . " when you visit a country , in every town there is a symbol of national pride , " ahmadinejad said , but added that in germany " every town has something saying to the great german people that their parent and grandparents were murderers . " last-minute talks fail last-minute talks between iran 's nuclear chief gholam reza aghazadeh and iaea director mohamed elbaradei on wednesday failed to make any headway , diplomats said . one diplomat said aghazadeh simply " just rattled around on iran 's previously stated positions .
he did not propose anything new . " the white house has warned the country was facing further international isolation after supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei threatened global retaliation to any american military action . iran has already warned that sanctions could force it to halt cooperation with the iaea or even quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . china , russia oppose action in beijing , chinese foreign ministry spokesman qin gang issued an appeal for calm . " we indeed think the iranian nuclear issue is at a crucial stage , " he said .
" we hope all parties concerned can keep calm , exercise restraint and create favorable conditions so as to properly resolve this issue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and china do n't want to take action in the security council russian president vladimir putin also said the iaea needed to continue playing a key role in the crisis - signaling his reluctance to see the matter fully referred to the security council . " it is too early to run ahead and say what decisions we might take together , " he said during a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel in the siberian city of tomsk .
" the main thing is that any decisions that are made must be made in agreement . " merkel , whose country is iran 's largest european trading partner , also called for a diplomatic resolution to the standoff . nato dinner talk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer speaking in the bulgarian capital sofia , nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer voiced concerns . " although it is not playing the first violin , what happens there -lrb- in iran -rrb- is a very nato-relevant subject , " he said as he prepared to host talks among the alliance 's foreign ministers including us secretary of state condoleezza rice .

she became environment minister in 1993 .
i was india 's environment minister at the time and we worked together in those days .
so when i met her here in hanover this time , we were reminiscing about those old days .
germany , like other european countries , is now looking more at india because india today symbolizes multiculturalism , religious diversity and democracy .
more importantly , it 's a country which has had growth with democracy .
chancellor merkel did say that this was a very important thing in the world today and that india is a stabilizing force . how important is germany as a trade partner for india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel and indian dancers at the hanover fair as one of our largest trading partners in europe , we greatly value our relationship with germany .
our bilateral trade has been growing at 20 percent on average over the last years .
big german companies already have a presence in india .
what we need to do now is to have a greater engagement with small-scale and mid-sized companies , who sometimes are not very aware of the opportunities of the indian market .
the second thing we need is to extend our trade basket .
the content of our bilateral trade basket must have more mass and more diversity in it . in germany , india is often perceived as taking away jobs from germans .
should germans be worried ? europe has a technological edge over asia .
in the new economic architecture , germany and other european countries need to restructure themselves to use their strengths in a more sustainable manner .
previously automobiles were made in europe .
today they may still be produced in europe , but they are also increasingly made in india .
at the same time , our low labor costs have led to german companies making more profits .
india and germany need to work in a partnership together towards a new economic architecture so that europe 's innovation strengths are once again made profitable . german companies have focused more on china than on india .
why do you think india still lags behind china ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh with chinese premier wen jiabao india and china are two different models - it 's not india versus china , it 's india and china .
india 's a free market economy , a democracy .
also , india embarked on its reform process in 1991 , almost 15 years behind china .
today we 're one of the fastest growing free-market democracies in the world , our inflation is in check .
all the economic indices are working well .
while china 's growth is export-market driven , india 's is fuelled by strong domestic demand . for german and other foreign investors , poor infrastructure in india still remains a huge deterrent .
when will that change ? it 's true that infrastructure is a huge problem in india and we are looking at german investments there .
india has largely focused on rural infrastructure in the past , but now urban infrastructure is our greatest priority and we have taken a number of steps to address the issue .
we 're working on the largest road project in the world linking up india 's biggest cities , we 've identified five ultra-mega power projects , we 're tackling our airports and frankfurt airport has already won the bid to modernize delhi airport .
similarly , we need to double the capacity of our ports - which we are in the process of doing - in order to sustain the level of our trade . are you concerned by protectionist instincts in europe as indian companies increasingly flex their muscle and expand abroad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india only wants foreign investment that creates jobs the greatest champions of globalization now want to get protectionist because they 're not globally competitive .
of course every country wants to protect its jobs .
india too wants foreign direct investment only where it creates incremental economic activity .
at the same time we have to realize that the new economic architecture is going to be driven by different ingredients than it was in the past .
in today 's world , cross-border mergers and takeovers are increasingly a business of shareholders and governments should keep out of the way . india too has been accused by foreign investors of being protectionist , especially when it comes to retail trade . german retail giant metro was one of the first to enter wholesale trade in india .
they 've had a few problems , but metro has done a good job .
we have to change some of our laws .
but we want foreign investment in retail to be incremental - it should not replace jobs , it should add them .
we want foreign retail companies to look at bigger stores so it does n't displace the small neighborhood retailers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the eurofighter become part of india 's military equipment ?
germany has said it 's interested in selling military planes to india .
does it stand a chance against the russians ? everybody 's given a fair chance in india .
we have to see that our defense requirements are met in the best way in terms of technology and price .
russia has no special real edge .
defense equipment is a long , drawn-out process , german shipbuilders too have a chance in supplying the indian navy - they have been doing so in the past and will continue to do so . india wants to boost its share of nuclear power to secure its growing energy needs and wants german help with nuclear technology .
how has germany reacted on the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany help india with nuclear technology ?
i think we got a good response from chancellor merkel who has pointed out that she is n't against supplying us with nuclear technology fundamentally .
germany knows that india will be a very big energy-guzzler and it will think twice about whether to let it go the hydro-carbon route or the nuclear route in the overall interest of the world .
after all , it 's all very well to say ' no nuclear , ' but let 's not forget that when india goes from 125,000 megawatts to 250,000 megawatts of electricity , we 'll have to consider its impact on global climate change .
germany is well aware of that . sonia phalnikar interviewed kamal nath in delhi and in hanover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany hopes to help india spread the light india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .
delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector .

he believes the hedgehog population in wales has fallen up to 20 % in the past five years .
mr williams , who is fronting a new series of the bbc wales programme iolo 's welsh safari , wants to draw up a spot-check survey of the species .
he said : " i want people to tell me about hedgehogs they know about , have they declined or are they doing well ? "
the tv presenter said the popularity of so-called garden makeovers , including the fashion for decking , is thought to be one of the reasons hedgehogs are finding it harder to thrive in urban areas .
mr williams , who has presented various nature series , including birdman and wild wales , said : " we do n't understand why there are fewer of them .
" we think we 're using a lot more chemicals than we used to , we 're a lot tidier around our gardens , using decking , etc .
hedgehogs do n't like all of that , so they have declined .
hedgehog numbers are in decline due to habitat loss " believe it or not , i have not seen a live hedgehog for almost two years now .
but that may not be the same everybody , and that 's what the programme wants to find out .
" some people may know of a hedgehog population that 's doing well , others may have had hedgehogs in their area in the past but noticed that they 're not there now .
" if we can build up a picture of how they and doing , where they are doing well and where they 're not , maybe people can do something about it . "
the appeal is the first of five in the series aimed at highlighting the diversity of wales ' wildlife , as well as the dangers it faces .
viewers are invited to e-mail their information to wales.nature @ bbc.co.uk or phone 0870 3334585 .
iolo 's welsh safari is screened on bbc one wales on wednesday 3 may at 1900 bst .

calls for home secretary charles clarke 's resignation over the foreign criminals affair - as it emerged he had known of the problem for months but failed to stop it - would have been bad enough .
but he was also greeted by the revelation - with a series of full colour photographs - that the deputy prime minister , john prescott , had had an affair which had left his wife " devastated " .
and then health secretary patricia hewitt was heckled by frontline health workers for the second time in three days - having to abandon her prepared speech amid a rowdy reception from the royal college of nursing conference in bournemouth .
and all this as the cash-for-peerages row continues to rumble throughout westminster and speculation over the timing of the prime minister 's departure from number 10 refuses to die down .
the sense of a government that is struggling to keep control of events , with the prime minister attempting to fight one forest fire after another , is hard to escape .
the latest events have already been described by some as the government 's ' black wednesday ' .
the image of a government struggling to keep control was one tory leader david cameron played up during question time , claiming the government was too bothered about watching its back to deal properly with incompetent ministers .
the latest affairs have certainly proved yet another distraction at a time when the prime minister is attempting to concentrate on fighting the local elections and , more urgently for him , securing his legacy reforms in health and education .
hands up firstly , as far as the home secretary is concerned , his position took a significant turn for the worse in the space of just a few hours .
tory spokesman david davis , who had only last night held back from demanding mr clarke 's head , declared during a commons statement that his position was now untenable .
probably worse , mr clarke confirmed he told the prime minister of the affair before christmas and even offered to resign yesterday - suggesting he accepts this may well be a resignation issue .
that has succeeded in dragging tony blair into the row and he will now face continuing questions over his own role in it .
and , while mr clarke may still be attracting the prime minister 's support , it seems he may only have been left in his job so he can sort out the mess .
it was also noted that the prime minister did not stay in the commons after question time to listen to mr clarke 's statement .
mr clarke himself , meanwhile , appears to have adopted a version of the self-flagellation strategy , touring every media outlet and making a full commons statement admitting the mistake , putting his hands up and insisting it is his duty to stay and sort it out .
it is a tried and tested strategy which may or may not have the desired effect .
full backing but the opposition parties now have him firmly in their sights with , unusually , both the tories and liberal democrats demanding his resignation .
and it is far from certain that he will be able to weather this storm in the longer term - there is still a government re-shuffle expected some time this summer , for example .
on another front , john prescott 's private life has been opened up to further scrutiny after he admitted to the affair with one of his secretaries .
that will widely be seen as a purely private matter and the prime minister has offered his full backing .
it is , none the less , yet another distraction and will see some drawing fresh parallels with the allegations of sleaze which labour used to help damage the last tory government .
ms hewitt 's experience , being slow handclapped and booed and heckled by nurses , can not have done much to strengthen her position seeing through health reforms which mr blair hopes will be one of his legacies .
as these separate forest fires continue to flare up , the prime minister will find his task of concentrating on the job in hand increasingly difficult .

hands up firstly , as far as the home secretary is concerned , his position took a significant turn for the worse in the space of just a few hours .
mr prescott has admitted to an affair tory spokesman david davis , who had only last night held back from demanding mr clarke 's head , declared during a commons statement that his position was now untenable .
probably worse , mr clarke confirmed he told the prime minister of the affair before christmas and even offered to resign yesterday - suggesting he accepts this may well be a resignation issue .
that has succeeded in dragging tony blair into the row and he will now face continuing questions over his own role in it .
and , while mr clarke may still be attracting the prime minister 's support , it seems he may only have been left in his job so he can sort out the mess .
it was also noted that the prime minister did not stay in the commons after question time to listen to mr clarke 's statement .
mr clarke himself , meanwhile , appears to have adopted a version of the self-flagellation strategy , touring every media outlet and making a full commons statement admitting the mistake , putting his hands up and insisting it is his duty to stay and sort it out .
it is a tried and tested strategy which may or may not have the desired effect .
full backing but the opposition parties now have him firmly in their sights with , unusually , both the tories and liberal democrats demanding his resignation .
and it is far from certain that he will be able to weather this storm in the longer term - there is still a government re-shuffle expected some time this summer , for example .
mr davis has stepped up attack on clarke on another front , john prescott 's private life has been opened up to further scrutiny after he admitted to the affair with one of his secretaries .
that will widely be seen as a purely private matter and the prime minister has offered his full backing .
it is , none the less , yet another distraction and will see some drawing fresh parallels with the allegations of sleaze which labour used to help damage the last tory government .
ms hewitt 's experience , being slow handclapped and booed and heckled by nurses , can not have done much to strengthen her position seeing through health reforms which mr blair hopes will be one of his legacies .
as these separate forest fires continue to flare up , the prime minister will find his task of concentrating on the job in hand increasingly difficult .

mr clarke offered to resign calls for home secretary charles clarke 's resignation over the foreign criminals affair - as it emerged he had known of the problem for months but failed to stop it - would have been bad enough .
but he was also greeted by the revelation - with a series of full colour photographs - that the deputy prime minister , john prescott , had had an affair which had left his wife " devastated " .
and then health secretary patricia hewitt was heckled by frontline health workers for the second time in three days - having to abandon her prepared speech amid a rowdy reception from the royal college of nursing conference in bournemouth .
and all this as the cash-for-peerages row continues to rumble throughout westminster and speculation over the timing of the prime minister 's departure from number 10 refuses to die down .
the sense of a government that is struggling to keep control of events , with the prime minister attempting to fight one forest fire after another , is hard to escape .
the latest events have already been described by some as the government 's ' black wednesday ' .
the image of a government struggling to keep control was one tory leader david cameron played up during question time , claiming the government was too bothered about watching its back to deal properly with incompetent ministers .
the latest affairs have certainly proved yet another distraction at a time when the prime minister is attempting to concentrate on fighting the local elections and , more urgently for him , securing his legacy reforms in health and education .
hands up firstly , as far as the home secretary is concerned , his position took a significant turn for the worse in the space of just a few hours .
mr prescott has admitted to an affair tory spokesman david davis , who had only last night held back from demanding mr clarke 's head , declared during a commons statement that his position was now untenable .
probably worse , mr clarke confirmed he told the prime minister of the affair before christmas and even offered to resign yesterday - suggesting he accepts this may well be a resignation issue .
that has succeeded in dragging tony blair into the row and he will now face continuing questions over his own role in it .
and , while mr clarke may still be attracting the prime minister 's support , it seems he may only have been left in his job so he can sort out the mess .
it was also noted that the prime minister did not stay in the commons after question time to listen to mr clarke 's statement .
mr clarke himself , meanwhile , appears to have adopted a version of the self-flagellation strategy , touring every media outlet and making a full commons statement admitting the mistake , putting his hands up and insisting it is his duty to stay and sort it out .
it is a tried and tested strategy which may or may not have the desired effect .
full backing but the opposition parties now have him firmly in their sights with , unusually , both the tories and liberal democrats demanding his resignation .
and it is far from certain that he will be able to weather this storm in the longer term - there is still a government re-shuffle expected some time this summer , for example .
mr davis has stepped up attack on clarke on another front , john prescott 's private life has been opened up to further scrutiny after he admitted to the affair with one of his secretaries .

" it 's just becoming increasingly part of the deal with premieres , and possibly that 's because cruise is setting this example in his super a-list position , " says helen o 'hara from empire magazine .
" will smith is another who does hugely long walkabouts around the entire crowd .
in fact , one time he was in london recently , he also put on a concert for the crowd , and i think even tom cruise would have to do quite a few more hours to beat that . "
but how do other celebrities behave when invited to interact - and how easy is it for people to meet their favourite stars ?
' one shot ' one of the attractions of film premieres is the rare access they provide to hollywood stars .
music fans can wait at stage doors or attend world tours , but as ms o 'hara points out , with actors , " you 've got one shot per film to see them " .
will smith is considered to go out of his way to meet his public a number of companies organise autograph fairs and celebrity conventions to enable fans to pay to meet their favourite stars , especially tv actors .
five stars from the real-time drama 24 are promised at a convention in london in may , for instance , while brian cooney , an organiser at wolf events in the uk , is working towards shows with cast members from sci-fi series alias , battlestar galactica and stargate sg-1 .
" if they 're a theatre actor , they get applause , but if they 're a tv actor , somebody yells ' cut ' and they never know what people think of their work , " he says .
" when they turn up at an event , it gives them the opportunity to get the feedback to what they 've done , so it 's very personal . "
mr cooney also says access to celebrities can vary by country .
" i 've been told by people who 've recently been to a us event that we totally spoil them .
sean connery would devote time towards the james bond fan club " here , the actors tend to have photo opportunities with the fans , they will overrun their talk times and exceed their signing times excessively because they want to get through everybody . "
support of celebrities david black , who chairs the 2,000-member james bond international fan club , also believes stars and directors acknowledge his organisation 's efforts .
" my predecessor did invite sean connery to something , and he actually did bother to phone up .
certainly i know i 've seen letters here from some of the directors , who do appreciate the fans ' point of view and thank us for writing the magazine , so the audience is remembered . "
however , there can be disappointment among fans when their favourite celebrities cut short appearances on the red carpet - even if they have a good excuse .
" i do n't know of any stars who would do that as a general rule but i think there are stars who have done it on occasion for whatever reason , " says ms o 'hara .
" usually it 's tiredness , because they 've either just flown in from the states or have done interviews all day and ca n't face three hours of walkabouts .
" also there 's the weather , especially in britain .
if it 's pouring with rain , there are some people who wo n't do it and scurry on inside the cinema , " she adds .
" but having said that , i think it has become part of the game that they do make the effort at least . "
the british weather can deter stars from lingering on the red carpet stars are ' perceptive ' mr cooney agrees that most of the celebrities he deals with are perceptive enough to understand they will receive more invitations if they 're outgoing and friendly , because " they will get a reputation for being a good guest " .
there are the odd actors " who want to do their allotted time and then head for the door " , he says , but he tends to avoid approaching those demanding high appearance fees or who will put in only minimum effort .
however , mr black suggests that there is a certain air of mystery about film stars being aloof and unavailable - and thinks perhaps it should stay that way .
" maybe people do n't want their movie stars to be an everyday , humdrum person who 's shopping in woolworths , " he says .
" maybe they would rather be at a bit of a distance .
maybe tom cruise is breaking with tradition by coming back in and talking to the people . "

" it 's just becoming increasingly part of the deal with premieres , and possibly that 's because cruise is setting this example in his super a-list position , " says helen o 'hara from empire magazine .
" will smith is another who does hugely long walkabouts around the entire crowd .
in fact , one time he was in london recently , he also put on a concert for the crowd , and i think even tom cruise would have to do quite a few more hours to beat that . "
but how do other celebrities behave when invited to interact - and how easy is it for people to meet their favourite stars ?
' one shot ' one of the attractions of film premieres is the rare access they provide to hollywood stars .
music fans can wait at stage doors or attend world tours , but as ms o 'hara points out , with actors , " you 've got one shot per film to see them " .
will smith is considered to go out of his way to meet his public a number of companies organise autograph fairs and celebrity conventions to enable fans to pay to meet their favourite stars , especially tv actors .
five stars from the real-time drama 24 are promised at a convention in london in may , for instance , while brian cooney , an organiser at wolf events in the uk , is working towards shows with cast members from sci-fi series alias , battlestar galactica and stargate sg-1 .
" if they 're a theatre actor , they get applause , but if they 're a tv actor , somebody yells ' cut ' and they never know what people think of their work , " he says .
" when they turn up at an event , it gives them the opportunity to get the feedback to what they 've done , so it 's very personal . "
mr cooney also says access to celebrities can vary by country .
" i 've been told by people who 've recently been to a us event that we totally spoil them .
sean connery would devote time towards the james bond fan club " here , the actors tend to have photo opportunities with the fans , they will overrun their talk times and exceed their signing times excessively because they want to get through everybody . "
support of celebrities david black , who chairs the 2,000-member james bond international fan club , also believes stars and directors acknowledge his organisation 's efforts .
" my predecessor did invite sean connery to something , and he actually did bother to phone up .
certainly i know i 've seen letters here from some of the directors , who do appreciate the fans ' point of view and thank us for writing the magazine , so the audience is remembered . "
however , there can be disappointment among fans when their favourite celebrities cut short appearances on the red carpet - even if they have a good excuse .
" i do n't know of any stars who would do that as a general rule but i think there are stars who have done it on occasion for whatever reason , " says ms o 'hara .
" usually it 's tiredness , because they 've either just flown in from the states or have done interviews all day and ca n't face three hours of walkabouts .
" also there 's the weather , especially in britain .
if it 's pouring with rain , there are some people who wo n't do it and scurry on inside the cinema , " she adds .
" but having said that , i think it has become part of the game that they do make the effort at least . "
the british weather can deter stars from lingering on the red carpet stars are ' perceptive ' mr cooney agrees that most of the celebrities he deals with are perceptive enough to understand they will receive more invitations if they 're outgoing and friendly , because " they will get a reputation for being a good guest " .
there are the odd actors " who want to do their allotted time and then head for the door " , he says , but he tends to avoid approaching those demanding high appearance fees or who will put in only minimum effort .
however , mr black suggests that there is a certain air of mystery about film stars being aloof and unavailable - and thinks perhaps it should stay that way .
" maybe people do n't want their movie stars to be an everyday , humdrum person who 's shopping in woolworths , " he says .
" maybe they would rather be at a bit of a distance .
maybe tom cruise is breaking with tradition by coming back in and talking to the people . "

just over half of companies take no steps to secure data held on these devices , found a uk government-backed security survey .
now security firms are developing ways to help firms control access to the confidential data held on the gadgets .
they are also working on ways to stop the devices being used by viruses as a way to bypass other digital defences .
data deluge figures from the information security breaches survey , which is backed by the department of trade and industry , reveals how firms are struggling to control the growing use of usb flash memory sticks .
the survey found that 33 % of firms tell staff not to use such devices but rarely do anything to change the configuration of pcs and laptops to stop people moving data around with usb sticks .
memory sticks make it easy to move lots of data around only 10 % of those companies interviewed for the survey encrypt the confidential data stored on these portable devices .
dennis szerszen , spokesman for security software firm secure wave , said in some sense the risk portable storage systems pose has been around since the emergence of the floppy disk .
" but , " he told the bbc news website , " that was just 360 kilobytes of risk not four gigabytes that can be transferred in five minutes . "
the popularity of mp3 players and digital cameras was also driving the development of a culture that is happy to carry around lots of data with them .
few companies were mandating use of usb sticks but their usefulness was leading many people to carry and use them , said mr szerszen .
as a result , many usb sticks and other portable media devices now carried both private and business data .
vital business information , such as drug recipes or blueprints could easily be stored on a usb stick , he said .
recently it was discovered that usb sticks full of us military secrets were being sold on market stalls in afghanistan .
mr szerszen said secure wave has signed a deal with flash memory firm lexar so that certain potentially dangerous uses of the hardware are logged and flagged by its security software .
swapping sticks different ways to manage and monitor usb flash devices so they stay secure were on show at the information security trade fair held at olympia in london from 25-27 april .
some security measures encrypt data put on removable drives such as flash memory sticks and others just keep an eye on what is being transferred back and forth .
matt fisher , spokesman for centennial software , said usb sticks could also become an attack vector for viruses and other malicious programs largely because they are swapped between many different computers .
" everyone expects a virus to come through the -lsb- e-mail -rsb- gateway , " he said , " no one expects them to come in on a usb stick . "
an informal survey by centennial showed that 66 % of people mislay usb sticks and that 60 % of those devices have business information on them .
mr fisher said firms needed a way to manage the information being stored on these devices to ensure they keep copies of important data and to guard against it going missing by accident or malice .

just over half of companies take no steps to secure data held on these devices , found a uk government-backed security survey .
now security firms are developing ways to help firms control access to the confidential data held on the gadgets .
they are also working on ways to stop the devices being used by viruses as a way to bypass other digital defences .
data deluge figures from the information security breaches survey , which is backed by the department of trade and industry , reveals how firms are struggling to control the growing use of usb flash memory sticks .
the survey found that 33 % of firms tell staff not to use such devices but rarely do anything to change the configuration of pcs and laptops to stop people moving data around with usb sticks .
memory sticks make it easy to move lots of data around only 10 % of those companies interviewed for the survey encrypt the confidential data stored on these portable devices .
dennis szerszen , spokesman for security software firm secure wave , said in some sense the risk portable storage systems pose has been around since the emergence of the floppy disk .
" but , " he told the bbc news website , " that was just 360 kilobytes of risk not four gigabytes that can be transferred in five minutes . "
the popularity of mp3 players and digital cameras was also driving the development of a culture that is happy to carry around lots of data with them .
few companies were mandating use of usb sticks but their usefulness was leading many people to carry and use them , said mr szerszen .
as a result , many usb sticks and other portable media devices now carried both private and business data .
vital business information , such as drug recipes or blueprints could easily be stored on a usb stick , he said .
recently it was discovered that usb sticks full of us military secrets were being sold on market stalls in afghanistan .
mr szerszen said secure wave has signed a deal with flash memory firm lexar so that certain potentially dangerous uses of the hardware are logged and flagged by its security software .
swapping sticks different ways to manage and monitor usb flash devices so they stay secure were on show at the information security trade fair held at olympia in london from 25-27 april .
some security measures encrypt data put on removable drives such as flash memory sticks and others just keep an eye on what is being transferred back and forth .
matt fisher , spokesman for centennial software , said usb sticks could also become an attack vector for viruses and other malicious programs largely because they are swapped between many different computers .

mrs arbour , who is in ethiopia visiting prisons , said conditions she had seen were " rudimentary " and " harsh " .
she said it was not right that detainees had been held in custody for a year without bail .
opposition leaders and journalists are among 129 people who have been denied bail after being accused of genocide .
' in decline ' mrs arbour also said she was surprised that such serious charges , which also include treason , were brought after a series of opposition protests following allegations of election fraud a year ago .
on tuesday , a group of western diplomats based in addis ababa called on the government to release all elected leaders , so they could help with the post-election reconciliation process .
their trial is expected to resume next week .
several thousand people were arrested after the protests , in which more than 80 people were killed , after security forces opened fire .
" it is worrying that at best we are in -lsb- a -rsb- state of stagnation , especially regarding political and civil rights which are in decline after months and years of hope , " she told the afp news agency .
during her visit to kaliti prison , mrs arbour met some of the detained coalition for unity and democracy -lrb- cud -rrb- leaders .
" i was particularly struck and distressed to see in the women 's quarter of the prison ... children from infants to five-year-olds , whose mothers are incarcerated , running around in prison , " she said .
mrs arbour also held talks with prime minister meles zenawi but said she had received no promises of leniency if the opposition figures , civil rights activists and media workers are convicted of crimes which can be punished by death .
mr meles has denied the charges of election fraud and blames the opposition for starting the violent protests , in which members of his tigray community were allegedly targeted .
his government also points out that his government introduce multi-party elections to ethiopia after years of military rule .
in the elections , the opposition made huge gains but say they were cheated out of victory .

while british authorities agonise over what to do with the legacy of half a century of nuclear power , finland is one of a handful of countries which has embarked on the journey towards a " final " waste solution .
enter the 6.5m-high , 5m-wide -lrb- 20ft-high , 16ft-wide -rrb- onkalo tunnel , and you would drive down a spiralling track which will eventually stretch 5km -lrb- 3miles -rrb- through solid rock , reaching a depth of 500m -lrb- 1,600ft -rrb- .
the first travellers to go down the tunnel will be investigators aiming to demonstrate that the rock is structurally sound enough to proceed with the disposal of spent fuel rods containing plutonium and other unpleasant materials .
if they were to turn up a positive result , and if government agencies grant the necessary licences , the first canisters of spent fuel would begin rolling down the tunnel about 15 years from now .
as things stand , finland is on course to become the first country in the world to entomb its most troublesome nuclear waste in a designated final resting place .
click here to see a visual representation of deep disposal ' multiple barriers ' the onkalo facility is run by the company posiva , and the system it uses is a swedish concept called kbs3 , which sweden 's proposed repository would also implement .
the onkalo tunnel will spiral to a depth of 500m the other country close to solving its problem , the us , is exploring a different technology at its yucca mountain site .
" the safety concept is based on so-called ' multiple barriers ' , " says timo aikas , posiva 's vice-president in charge of engineering .
" one barrier is of course the solid stable crystalline rock .
the remaining barriers are engineered barriers , the most important of which is long corrosion-resistant copper canisters , inside which we put the actual fuel rods . "
in this vision , the bottom of the onkalo tunnel would sprout a grid of horizontal shafts .
canisters containing the spent fuel rods would be deposited into holes in the bottom of each shaft .
the canisters would nest in a bed of bentonite clay , which swells when it absorbs water .
this comes with twin benefits ; cushioning the cargo from geological movement , and ensuring there are no voids where substantial quantities of water can penetrate , corroding the canisters and carrying away their radioactive contents .
as each canister goes in , the tunnels would be filled up again with yet more clay and rock .
i would not want this marketed as ' waste issue solved ' , because it 's not kaisa kosonen , greenpeace by 2100 , the repository would be complete , access routes would be filled and sealed .
what to do next would be a decision for finns of that era ; but the concept is designed to allow them , if they want , to cover the tunnel mouth , landscape it and walk away , leaving no entrance into the rock and no sign of the material buried underneath .
a granite curtain would have descended on the first civilian nuclear epoch .
through the ice age some of the radionuclides - atoms with unstable nuclei that undergo radioactive decay - in spent fuel rods remain radioactive for more than 100,000 years .
in that time , could not even the tiny quantities of water which the bentonite allows through penetrate the copper canister shells , allowing dangerously active isotopes to escape ?
timo aikas believes not .
" we have seen that the copper canister will not be corroded away , " he says .
" we have native copper in the finnish and swedish bedrock , which means we have good conditions for such things .
we know from corrosion testing that 1.5cm -lsb- thickness -rsb- of copper would be enough from the corrosion standpoint for times longer than 100,000 years , but we have 5cm -lrb- two inches -rrb- copper . "
the time period is so mind-bendingly long that it will almost certainly take the world through another ice age ; which , if history is a guide , would bury finland and sweden under 2-3km of ice .
fuel rods are placed inside a steel cylinder cased in copper the huge pressures created by this ice will certainly deform even bedrock , compressing the copper canisters and fuel rods which lie inside -lrb- the rods are contained within channels bored into a steel cylinder -rrb- .
so concerned have european authorities been about this that the european commission 's institute for energy in the netherlands commissioned pressure tests on the steel cylinders .
" the maximum -lsb- ice -rsb- thickness is 3km , which equates to a pressure of 30 megapascals -lrb- mpa -rrb- , " says the engineer in charge , kalle nielsson .
combined with pressure from groundwater and the tight embrace of bentonite clay , the cylinders would experience a total pressure of 45 mpa , which corresponds to the pressure you would have 4,500m -lrb- 15,000ft -rrb- down in the ocean .
in tests , the cylinders stood up to a pressure three times that value before failing .
" i would say that it 's safe , " is kalle nielsson 's conclusion .
" and we have made a probabilistic calculation - ' what is the probability that it would fail at this 45 mpa ? ' - and it is less than one out of a million canisters that would fail .
so i would say as a concept that it 's safe . "
far-sighted funds technology is only one part of the finnish solution ; the other vital component is finance .
" our current cost estimate for this ' funeral ' is about 3bn euros , " says timo aikas .
when you make a decision concerning this kind of thing , you have to have trust timo aikas three billion euros is a significant sum of money .
is this another example , then , of the state having to pay vast sums to clean up a nuclear industry which has in the past generated profit for private ends ?
the signs point in a different direction .
the advent of commercial nuclear power to finland in the late 1970s saw the establishment of a fund to pay for the eventual clean-up .
" every year , we have re-calculated the fund based on the amount of spent fuel accumulated , " says timo aikas , " and at the moment the fund is approximately 1.4bn euros . "
the money has come from generating companies through a small levy on the price of nuclear electricity .
it is , perhaps , the sort of measure which current british leaders looking at a waste disposal facility bill in the region of £ 10bn -lrb- 14bn euros -rrb- would wish their predecessors had chosen to implement .
rocky site even if the kbs3 concept is sound , even if finland has the money to implement it , there is a question over whether eurajoki is the best place to put it into action .
greenpeace , which has been spearheading a campaign against the new olkiluoto-3 nuclear reactor taking shape just a kilometre from the onkalo site , is concerned that the local geology may not be the soundest available .
construction work on finland 's new reactor proceeds nearby " when the site selection started in finland , the nuclear industry said they would find the best geological site , " says energy campaigner kaisa kosonen .
" and , eventually , they chose the site on sociological reasons , because eventually eurajoki was the first municipality to say ' ok , we can take it ' , and there was n't an active nuclear opposition in this area . "
that lack of local opposition may be down to the fact that nuclear reactors have stood in the area for three decades , gaining acceptance for an industry which has maintained a good local safety record and brought employment .
" it boils down basically to trust , " comments timo aikas .
" when you make a decision concerning this kind of thing , which takes us to 2100 when the final sealing takes place , there will always be uncertainty .
so you have to have trust . "
kaisa kosonen urges caution ; the case for onkalo , she says , is not proven .
" i would like to see much more research done and not having this hasty process , " she says .
" and i would not want this marketed as ' waste issue solved ' , because it 's not . "
but timo aikas believes his system and his team deserve the trust they have found in eurajoki , and that onkalo will prove as safe a resting place for highly active radionuclides as can be found , barring any surprises with the local geology .
and he urges other countries , britain included , to take a decision and find a solution .
" nuclear waste does n't go away , " he reflects .
" and if we just keep it in stores above ground we just push the problem to the next generation .
it 's much more responsible now to develop solutions on how to take care of it . "

" the maximum -lsb- ice -rsb- thickness is 3km , which equates to a pressure of 30 megapascals -lrb- mpa -rrb- , " says the engineer in charge , kalle nielsson .
combined with pressure from groundwater and the tight embrace of bentonite clay , the cylinders would experience a total pressure of 45 mpa , which corresponds to the pressure you would have 4,500m -lrb- 15,000ft -rrb- down in the ocean .
in tests , the cylinders stood up to a pressure three times that value before failing .
" i would say that it 's safe , " is kalle nielsson 's conclusion .
" and we have made a probabilistic calculation - ' what is the probability that it would fail at this 45 mpa ? ' - and it is less than one out of a million canisters that would fail .
so i would say as a concept that it 's safe . "
far-sighted funds technology is only one part of the finnish solution ; the other vital component is finance .
" our current cost estimate for this ' funeral ' is about 3bn euros , " says timo aikas .
when you make a decision concerning this kind of thing , you have to have trust timo aikas three billion euros is a significant sum of money .
is this another example , then , of the state having to pay vast sums to clean up a nuclear industry which has in the past generated profit for private ends ?
the signs point in a different direction .
the advent of commercial nuclear power to finland in the late 1970s saw the establishment of a fund to pay for the eventual clean-up .
" every year , we have re-calculated the fund based on the amount of spent fuel accumulated , " says timo aikas , " and at the moment the fund is approximately 1.4bn euros . "
the money has come from generating companies through a small levy on the price of nuclear electricity .
it is , perhaps , the sort of measure which current british leaders looking at a waste disposal facility bill in the region of £ 10bn -lrb- 14bn euros -rrb- would wish their predecessors had chosen to implement .
rocky site even if the kbs3 concept is sound , even if finland has the money to implement it , there is a question over whether eurajoki is the best place to put it into action .
greenpeace , which has been spearheading a campaign against the new olkiluoto-3 nuclear reactor taking shape just a kilometre from the onkalo site , is concerned that the local geology may not be the soundest available .
construction work on finland 's new reactor proceeds nearby " when the site selection started in finland , the nuclear industry said they would find the best geological site , " says energy campaigner kaisa kosonen .
" and , eventually , they chose the site on sociological reasons , because eventually eurajoki was the first municipality to say ' ok , we can take it ' , and there was n't an active nuclear opposition in this area . "
that lack of local opposition may be down to the fact that nuclear reactors have stood in the area for three decades , gaining acceptance for an industry which has maintained a good local safety record and brought employment .
" it boils down basically to trust , " comments timo aikas .
" when you make a decision concerning this kind of thing , which takes us to 2100 when the final sealing takes place , there will always be uncertainty .
so you have to have trust . "
kaisa kosonen urges caution ; the case for onkalo , she says , is not proven .
" i would like to see much more research done and not having this hasty process , " she says .
" and i would not want this marketed as ' waste issue solved ' , because it 's not . "
but timo aikas believes his system and his team deserve the trust they have found in eurajoki , and that onkalo will prove as safe a resting place for highly active radionuclides as can be found , barring any surprises with the local geology .
and he urges other countries , britain included , to take a decision and find a solution .
" nuclear waste does n't go away , " he reflects .
" and if we just keep it in stores above ground we just push the problem to the next generation .
it 's much more responsible now to develop solutions on how to take care of it . "

while british authorities agonise over what to do with the legacy of half a century of nuclear power , finland is one of a handful of countries which has embarked on the journey towards a " final " waste solution .
enter the 6.5m-high , 5m-wide -lrb- 20ft-high , 16ft-wide -rrb- onkalo tunnel , and you would drive down a spiralling track which will eventually stretch 5km -lrb- 3miles -rrb- through solid rock , reaching a depth of 500m -lrb- 1,600ft -rrb- .
the first travellers to go down the tunnel will be investigators aiming to demonstrate that the rock is structurally sound enough to proceed with the disposal of spent fuel rods containing plutonium and other unpleasant materials .
if they were to turn up a positive result , and if government agencies grant the necessary licences , the first canisters of spent fuel would begin rolling down the tunnel about 15 years from now .
as things stand , finland is on course to become the first country in the world to entomb its most troublesome nuclear waste in a designated final resting place .
click here to see a visual representation of deep disposal ' multiple barriers ' the onkalo facility is run by the company posiva , and the system it uses is a swedish concept called kbs3 , which sweden 's proposed repository would also implement .
the onkalo tunnel will spiral to a depth of 500m the other country close to solving its problem , the us , is exploring a different technology at its yucca mountain site .
" the safety concept is based on so-called ' multiple barriers ' , " says timo aikas , posiva 's vice-president in charge of engineering .
" one barrier is of course the solid stable crystalline rock .
the remaining barriers are engineered barriers , the most important of which is long corrosion-resistant copper canisters , inside which we put the actual fuel rods . "
in this vision , the bottom of the onkalo tunnel would sprout a grid of horizontal shafts .
canisters containing the spent fuel rods would be deposited into holes in the bottom of each shaft .
the canisters would nest in a bed of bentonite clay , which swells when it absorbs water .
this comes with twin benefits ; cushioning the cargo from geological movement , and ensuring there are no voids where substantial quantities of water can penetrate , corroding the canisters and carrying away their radioactive contents .
as each canister goes in , the tunnels would be filled up again with yet more clay and rock .
i would not want this marketed as ' waste issue solved ' , because it 's not kaisa kosonen , greenpeace by 2100 , the repository would be complete , access routes would be filled and sealed .
what to do next would be a decision for finns of that era ; but the concept is designed to allow them , if they want , to cover the tunnel mouth , landscape it and walk away , leaving no entrance into the rock and no sign of the material buried underneath .
a granite curtain would have descended on the first civilian nuclear epoch .
through the ice age some of the radionuclides - atoms with unstable nuclei that undergo radioactive decay - in spent fuel rods remain radioactive for more than 100,000 years .
in that time , could not even the tiny quantities of water which the bentonite allows through penetrate the copper canister shells , allowing dangerously active isotopes to escape ?
timo aikas believes not .
" we have seen that the copper canister will not be corroded away , " he says .
" we have native copper in the finnish and swedish bedrock , which means we have good conditions for such things .
we know from corrosion testing that 1.5cm -lsb- thickness -rsb- of copper would be enough from the corrosion standpoint for times longer than 100,000 years , but we have 5cm -lrb- two inches -rrb- copper . "
the time period is so mind-bendingly long that it will almost certainly take the world through another ice age ; which , if history is a guide , would bury finland and sweden under 2-3km of ice .

the money has come from generating companies through a small levy on the price of nuclear electricity .
it is , perhaps , the sort of measure which current british leaders looking at a waste disposal facility bill in the region of £ 10bn -lrb- 14bn euros -rrb- would wish their predecessors had chosen to implement .
rocky site even if the kbs3 concept is sound , even if finland has the money to implement it , there is a question over whether eurajoki is the best place to put it into action .
greenpeace , which has been spearheading a campaign against the new olkiluoto-3 nuclear reactor taking shape just a kilometre from the onkalo site , is concerned that the local geology may not be the soundest available .
" when the site selection started in finland , the nuclear industry said they would find the best geological site , " says energy campaigner kaisa kosonen .
" and , eventually , they chose the site on sociological reasons , because eventually eurajoki was the first municipality to say ' ok , we can take it ' , and there was n't an active nuclear opposition in this area . "
that lack of local opposition may be down to the fact that nuclear reactors have stood in the area for three decades , gaining acceptance for an industry which has maintained a good local safety record and brought employment .
" it boils down basically to trust , " comments timo aikas .
" when you make a decision concerning this kind of thing , which takes us to 2100 when the final sealing takes place , there will always be uncertainty .
so you have to have trust . "
kaisa kosonen urges caution ; the case for onkalo , she says , is not proven .
" i would like to see much more research done and not having this hasty process , " she says .
" and i would not want this marketed as ' waste issue solved ' , because it 's not . "
but timo aikas believes his system and his team deserve the trust they have found in eurajoki , and that onkalo will prove as safe a resting place for highly active radionuclides as can be found , barring any surprises with the local geology .
and he urges other countries , britain included , to take a decision and find a solution .
" nuclear waste does n't go away , " he reflects .
" and if we just keep it in stores above ground we just push the problem to the next generation .
it 's much more responsible now to develop solutions on how to take care of it . "

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- newsnight home -pipe- why wo n't media lens appear on newsnight ?
bbc news / newsnight home graphics version bbc sport home newsnight -pipe- newsnight review -pipe- newsnight scotland -pipe- thursday , 27 april 2006 , 09:57 gmt 10:57 uk why wo n't media lens appear on newsnight ?
after an outbreak of harmony last week , newsnight has found itself on the receiving end of the media watchers media lens ' displeasure once again .
this time it 's over an invitation to the website 's editors to appear on newsnight .
follow the flame war here on the media lens message board you can also follow the debate taking place on paul mason 's blog , or you can add your own views using our form below .
the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
the e-mails published reflect the balance of opinion received .
as someone who visits the medialens site i was a little disappointed by the editor 's decision to reject an invitation to go on newsnight .
they have shown themselves to be excellent analysts of the multitude of flaws and biases in the bbc coverage of international news and i believe that they represent a growing number of people who are turning away from networks like the bbc because it continually presents a version of events that flatters the british government and ignores the very great suffering of its victims .
michael hardiman , são luis , maranhão the editors of medialens and les roberts are academics used to intellectual debate rather than the rhetoric and bluster used by experienced politicians and journalists who appear regularly on tv .
they could be forgiven for being reticent about appearing on newsnight when the topic of discussion is loaded and already presumes iranian guilt by attempting to discuss the " iranian terror network " .
you have to understand their critique of the media to realise that the " debate " would simply reinforce the existing establishment bias of the bbc rather than shedding light on a serious subject .
the british and us governments already demonise iran when that country still allows full inspections by the iaea and has never committed a war of aggression against another country .
the bbc and other media outlets are airing propaganda for the benefit of the belligerent us and uk regimes .
dr m tasab , manchester for what it 's worth , i think that this decision -lrb- rightly -rrb- comes down to personal choice .
if you understand the arena , the limitations and how you are likely to be manipulated , you can come to an honest conclusion on whether you feel you could go on and still give a reasonable account of yourself and your views .
if not , or you have significant doubts , you do n't go on .
both conclusions are valid .
andy brunt , hebden bridge you could n't make it up - hilarious .
" media watchdogs " claim they are ignored by mainstream media .
mainstream media invite them onto show to expound this view .
" media watchdogs " refuse .
it 's catch 22 , they harass media outlets via email campaigns that are impervious to reasoned argument , to the point they get ignored by the media , then blame the media for ignoring them .
they refuse to have their views examined in debate because deep down they know that actually they 're based on pure prejudice , paranoia and bias , not rationality .
they lose the argument and then claim " ambush " .
the problem is that the paranoid left are stuck in a feedback loop , everyone ignores them apart from the " true believers " who share their paranoia , so all they usually get back is self-perpetuating praise from like-minded people .
rob jenks , manchester maybe it 's due to the fact that there is no real debate in the mainstream media and they ca n't be bothered going through the motions ?
don mackeen , glasgow we -lrb- contributors to the ml messageboard -rrb- do not take anyone 's opinions as our own without investigation , questions , critical analysis .
that 's hardly a flame war - in fact , it seems a rarity on the ml board for things to degenerate to such a state .
some people there -lrb- myself included -rrb- wish the editors of ml * would * appear on newsnight , despite their -lrb- most likely credible -rrb- misgivings , on the offchance that they will get a chance to do something good .
i can see both sides - and i think everyone else there can too .
there is no question newsnight systemically avoids the real issues at the core of such things as the invasion of iraq , and take steps to ensure that others ca n't easily point these out on their shows .
jeremy paxman asks " hard questions " of his interviewees , but almost never the questions -lrb- concerning such as iraq -rrb- which need to be asked .
he and his colleagues work within a framework of questions which can be asked , and those which can not .
derek lane , crawley the two davids of medialens were obviously very wise not to appear on newsnight if this is the way you intend to behave toward them .
there is no " flame war " , just an exchange of reasonable e-mails .
do you treat everyone who refuses to appear on your programme in this immature manner ?
sue sampson , nottingham i expect newsnight to be an objective forum for serious debate .
seeing an article on the front page of your website entitled " why wo n't medialens appear on newsnight " makes it seem more like a forum for whining playground nonsense .
i have no particular knowledge of medialens but judging from the tit for tat brand of journalism that is apparently flowing between your respective publications it appears that you both have axes to grind .
i think it would be infinitively preferable if you kept such diatribes off-line and spent license fee payers money online on more serious analysis .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- newsnight home -pipe- why wo n't media lens appear on newsnight ?
bbc news / newsnight home graphics version bbc sport home newsnight -pipe- newsnight scotland -pipe- thursday , 27 april 2006 , 09:57 gmt 10:57 uk why wo n't media lens appear on newsnight ?
after an outbreak of harmony last week , newsnight has found itself on the receiving end of the media watchers media lens ' displeasure once again .
this time it 's over an invitation to the website 's editors to appear on newsnight .
follow the flame war here on the media lens message board you can also follow the debate taking place on paul mason 's blog , or you can add your own views using our form below .
the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites .
the e-mails published reflect the balance of opinion received .
as someone who visits the medialens site i was a little disappointed by the editor 's decision to reject an invitation to go on newsnight .
they have shown themselves to be excellent analysts of the multitude of flaws and biases in the bbc coverage of international news and i believe that they represent a growing number of people who are turning away from networks like the bbc because it continually presents a version of events that flatters the british government and ignores the very great suffering of its victims .
michael hardiman , são luis , maranhão the editors of medialens and les roberts are academics used to intellectual debate rather than the rhetoric and bluster used by experienced politicians and journalists who appear regularly on tv .
they could be forgiven for being reticent about appearing on newsnight when the topic of discussion is loaded and already presumes iranian guilt by attempting to discuss the " iranian terror network " .
you have to understand their critique of the media to realise that the " debate " would simply reinforce the existing establishment bias of the bbc rather than shedding light on a serious subject .
the british and us governments already demonise iran when that country still allows full inspections by the iaea and has never committed a war of aggression against another country .
the bbc and other media outlets are airing propaganda for the benefit of the belligerent us and uk regimes .
dr m tasab , manchester for what it 's worth , i think that this decision -lrb- rightly -rrb- comes down to personal choice .
if you understand the arena , the limitations and how you are likely to be manipulated , you can come to an honest conclusion on whether you feel you could go on and still give a reasonable account of yourself and your views .
if not , or you have significant doubts , you do n't go on .
both conclusions are valid .
andy brunt , hebden bridge you could n't make it up - hilarious .
" media watchdogs " claim they are ignored by mainstream media .
mainstream media invite them onto show to expound this view .
" media watchdogs " refuse .
it 's catch 22 , they harass media outlets via email campaigns that are impervious to reasoned argument , to the point they get ignored by the media , then blame the media for ignoring them .
they refuse to have their views examined in debate because deep down they know that actually they 're based on pure prejudice , paranoia and bias , not rationality .
they lose the argument and then claim " ambush " .
the problem is that the paranoid left are stuck in a feedback loop , everyone ignores them apart from the " true believers " who share their paranoia , so all they usually get back is self-perpetuating praise from like-minded people .
rob jenks , manchester maybe it 's due to the fact that there is no real debate in the mainstream media and they ca n't be bothered going through the motions ?
don mackeen , glasgow we -lrb- contributors to the ml messageboard -rrb- do not take anyone 's opinions as our own without investigation , questions , critical analysis .
that 's hardly a flame war - in fact , it seems a rarity on the ml board for things to degenerate to such a state .
some people there -lrb- myself included -rrb- wish the editors of ml * would * appear on newsnight , despite their -lrb- most likely credible -rrb- misgivings , on the offchance that they will get a chance to do something good .
i can see both sides - and i think everyone else there can too .
there is no question newsnight systemically avoids the real issues at the core of such things as the invasion of iraq , and take steps to ensure that others ca n't easily point these out on their shows .
jeremy paxman asks " hard questions " of his interviewees , but almost never the questions -lrb- concerning such as iraq -rrb- which need to be asked .
he and his colleagues work within a framework of questions which can be asked , and those which can not .
derek lane , crawley the two davids of medialens were obviously very wise not to appear on newsnight if this is the way you intend to behave toward them .
there is no " flame war " , just an exchange of reasonable e-mails .
do you treat everyone who refuses to appear on your programme in this immature manner ?
sue sampson , nottingham i expect newsnight to be an objective forum for serious debate .
seeing an article on the front page of your website entitled " why wo n't medialens appear on newsnight " makes it seem more like a forum for whining playground nonsense .
i have no particular knowledge of medialens but judging from the tit for tat brand of journalism that is apparently flowing between your respective publications it appears that you both have axes to grind .
i think it would be infinitively preferable if you kept such diatribes off-line and spent license fee payers money online on more serious analysis .

michael hardiman , são luis , maranhão the editors of medialens and les roberts are academics used to intellectual debate rather than the rhetoric and bluster used by experienced politicians and journalists who appear regularly on tv .
they could be forgiven for being reticent about appearing on newsnight when the topic of discussion is loaded and already presumes iranian guilt by attempting to discuss the " iranian terror network " .
you have to understand their critique of the media to realise that the " debate " would simply reinforce the existing establishment bias of the bbc rather than shedding light on a serious subject .
the british and us governments already demonise iran when that country still allows full inspections by the iaea and has never committed a war of aggression against another country .
the bbc and other media outlets are airing propaganda for the benefit of the belligerent us and uk regimes .
dr m tasab , manchester for what it 's worth , i think that this decision -lrb- rightly -rrb- comes down to personal choice .
if you understand the arena , the limitations and how you are likely to be manipulated , you can come to an honest conclusion on whether you feel you could go on and still give a reasonable account of yourself and your views .

both conclusions are valid .
andy brunt , hebden bridge you could n't make it up - hilarious .
" media watchdogs " claim they are ignored by mainstream media .
mainstream media invite them onto show to expound this view .
" media watchdogs " refuse .
it 's catch 22 , they harass media outlets via email campaigns that are impervious to reasoned argument , to the point they get ignored by the media , then blame the media for ignoring them .
they refuse to have their views examined in debate because deep down they know that actually they 're based on pure prejudice , paranoia and bias , not rationality .
they lose the argument and then claim " ambush " .
the problem is that the paranoid left are stuck in a feedback loop , everyone ignores them apart from the " true believers " who share their paranoia , so all they usually get back is self-perpetuating praise from like-minded people .

there is no question newsnight systemically avoids the real issues at the core of such things as the invasion of iraq , and take steps to ensure that others ca n't easily point these out on their shows .

the first two rideouts , to bonchester bridge and cogsmill in early may , have been cancelled after strangles was confirmed at a local stables .
master of ceremonies for the common riding , john hope , described the move as a " precautionary measure " .
a local veterinary practice said the disease could be contained if suitable precautions were taken .
mr hope said the only sensible move would be to cancel the first rideouts .
" there have been two outbreaks of strangles confirmed in hawick , " he said .
" however , the outbreak is confined to one group of stables . "
veterinary advice " if there are no further outbreaks then we can re-look at the situation and hopefully we can carry on with the rest of the rideouts and the common riding itself .
" it is a precautionary measure . "
a spokesman for one local veterinary practice said outbreaks of strangles were not uncommon in the uk at this time of the year .
however , if suitable precautions were taken , it could be contained and there should be little threat to the wider calendar of events across the region .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : premier league tv rights bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies thursday , 27 april 2006 , 10:29 gmt 11:29 uk q & a : premier league tv rights broadcasters have been putting in their bids for the rights to show premier league football matches , ahead of the deadline later on thursday .
the winners of the six different match packages will be able to show matches for three years starting in 2007 .
why has this round of bidding attracted such attention ?
it comes after a long-running dispute between the fa premier league and the european commission over competition issues .
the commission said that by allowing one broadcaster to secure all the live tv rights the league was in breach of competition rules .
the commission had threatened to take legal action against the premier league if it failed to agree new arrangements giving other broadcasters a slice of live tv coverage of matches .
how was the situation resolved ?
the league has created six packages of " balanced " content , which is being auctioned off to broadcasters .
under the deal , no broadcaster is allowed to secure all six packages .
the packages will also have to " showcase the premier league as a whole " meaning that clubs from throughout the league will have to feature in live matches and not just the likes of chelsea , arsenal , manchester united and liverpool .
what exactly do the six packages contain ?
the six packages are : package a : 23 matches shown at 1600 on sunday package b : 23 matches shown at 1330 on sunday package c : a minimum of 12 matches at 2000 on monday , the rest either at 1330 on sunday or 1715 on saturday or other times package d : a minimum of 18 matches at 1715 on saturday , the rest either at 1330 on sunday , 2000 on monday or other times package e : 23 matches shown at 1245 on saturday package f : seven to 13 matches on midweek evenings / bank holidays , 10 to 16 at 1245 on saturday and 1600 on sunday .
who is in the running to snap up the packages ?
obviously bskyb - which currently holds the rights to all live premiership matches - will be in the running .
last week irish broadcaster setanta said it would bid for two packages at the " lower end of the scale " .
cable firm ntl , bt group , and itv have also been named as potential bidders .
the auction process will also be " technologically neutral " , allowing the possibility of games being broadcast over the internet .
however , analysts believe bskyb is still likely to take the majority of the six packages .
how much will the deal pump into football ?
when bskyb won the current packages of live matches running until 2007 , it paid £ 1.024bn -lrb- $ 1.77bn -rrb- to the premier league in 2003 .
analysts believe the current three-year rights will bring a total of about £ 1.1bn , up about 10 % from the last contract .
once the live uk rights are determined the premier league will then look to sell off its mobile phone rights and overseas rights .
last time round the premier league raised £ 1.6bn in total from all its rights , and will be looking to exceed this figure this time .
when will a decision be known ?
the premier league says an announcement will be made some time between the deadline day of thursday , 27 april , and 19 august , the date the new season starts .
a decision should be known sooner rather than later .
delays are only likely to be caused if none of the bids meet the undisclosed reserved prices for each package .
then a second round of bidding would have to be instigated .
however , it is surely in the interests of the league and broadcasters to get the issue resolved as soon as possible .

the winners of the six different match packages will be able to show matches for three years starting in 2007 .
why has this round of bidding attracted such attention ?
it comes after a long-running dispute between the fa premier league and the european commission over competition issues .
the commission said that by allowing one broadcaster to secure all the live tv rights the league was in breach of competition rules .
the commission had threatened to take legal action against the premier league if it failed to agree new arrangements giving other broadcasters a slice of live tv coverage of matches .
how was the situation resolved ?
the league has created six packages of " balanced " content , which is being auctioned off to broadcasters .
under the deal , no broadcaster is allowed to secure all six packages .
the packages will also have to " showcase the premier league as a whole " meaning that clubs from throughout the league will have to feature in live matches and not just the likes of chelsea , arsenal , manchester united and liverpool .
what exactly do the six packages contain ?
the six packages are : package a : 23 matches shown at 1600 on sunday package b : 23 matches shown at 1330 on sunday package c : a minimum of 12 matches at 2000 on monday , the rest either at 1330 on sunday or 1715 on saturday or other times package d : a minimum of 18 matches at 1715 on saturday , the rest either at 1330 on sunday , 2000 on monday or other times package e : 23 matches shown at 1245 on saturday package f : seven to 13 matches on midweek evenings / bank holidays , 10 to 16 at 1245 on saturday and 1600 on sunday .
who is in the running to snap up the packages ?
obviously bskyb - which currently holds the rights to all live premiership matches - will be in the running .
last week irish broadcaster setanta said it would bid for two packages at the " lower end of the scale " .
cable firm ntl , bt group , and itv have also been named as potential bidders .
the auction process will also be " technologically neutral " , allowing the possibility of games being broadcast over the internet .
however , analysts believe bskyb is still likely to take the majority of the six packages .
how much will the deal pump into football ?
when bskyb won the current packages of live matches running until 2007 , it paid £ 1.024bn -lrb- $ 1.77bn -rrb- to the premier league in 2003 .
analysts believe the current three-year rights will bring a total of about £ 1.1bn , up about 10 % from the last contract .
once the live uk rights are determined the premier league will then look to sell off its mobile phone rights and overseas rights .
last time round the premier league raised £ 1.6bn in total from all its rights , and will be looking to exceed this figure this time .
when will a decision be known ?
the premier league says an announcement will be made some time between the deadline day of thursday , 27 april , and 19 august , the date the new season starts .
a decision should be known sooner rather than later .
delays are only likely to be caused if none of the bids meet the undisclosed reserved prices for each package .
then a second round of bidding would have to be instigated .
however , it is surely in the interests of the league and broadcasters to get the issue resolved as soon as possible .

this page is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
the comments published on this page reflect the balance of views we received .
" shame on you ! "
these words were spoken by the old lady as she picked up splintered and torn orange banners at the end of an appalling show of brute force by the police against a non-violent demonstration .
i felt ashamed that i knew little of the struggle for freedom and democracy that we take so much for granted .
thank you bbc for this enlightening and thought-provoking documentary .
sharon burns , manchester i 'd just like to say that this is one of the best documentaries i 've seen in a long time .
sair r , manchester i lived in azerbaijan for 7 years and i can definitely tell you that the situation is much differenet from the one shown .
the programme is very biased towards the opposition .
john earnes , london an inspiring piece that takes you to highs , hopes , and then punches you in the stomach with the sickening abuse of power .
my hopes are with the people of azerbaijan .
their fight for liberty and freedom was not in vain as the truth has shown through , and will take a thousand souls on this side of the world to new heights of enlightenment .
the people are with you .
fight for freedom !
tobias pattle , braintree hugely insightful programme that highlighted the issues confronting -lrb- young -rrb- people in azerbaijan .
history has shown that demonstrations and togetherness of society can overthrow oppressive regimes - i really hope the protestors in azerbaijan can continue to build in strength and numbers to eventually overthrow the government as has been seen elsewhere in eastern europe .
they should not give up - the more people that come around to their beliefs , the better the chance of overthrowing the existing regime .
andy tate , london having been born in hungary myself , i can emphasise with these very unfortunate people .
although i read about widespread vote rigging in the papers last year , the scale of shamelessness by the " governing " party , the absolutely unjust political system and the lack of freedom was still shocking .
the west should be ashamed of itself .
what 's more important : money or freedom ?
most westerners are lucky enough never to have experienced authoritarian regimes .
thomas , london i just want to commend you on producing such an inspiring show .
it was a well-balanced documentary that helped people see just how easy it is for a government with such an intimidating police force and massive media machine working behind it , to control elections and the people in general .
thank you for daring to show some reality that people do n't often get to see .
and well done to your camera man for managing to stay alive throughout the whole film .
anyway , keep up the good work .
joe , uk i just wanted to say what an excellent programme i watched this evening .
how to plan a revolution demonstrated the complete lack of democracy in azerbaijan and the complicity of the us .
although george bush claims to support the move to democracy in this area it is obviously only in the countries that suit the us .
i will be watching carefully to see what happens in azerbaijan and thank the bbc for bringing this serious issue to my attention .
sally hornung , dorking i was shocked and yet sadly unsurprised as i watched this programme and saw the western leaders turn away from a fight for freedom and democracy that does n't suit their needs .
i can only applaud the resilience and bravery of those that fight for true democracy and freedom in azerbaijan .
a fantastic , thought-provoking documentary on an underreported injustice .
well done this world .
ruth sullivan , london this is a shocking and depressing documentary about a vicious regime shamelessly violating every human right that we take for granted in this country .
it also exposes the hypocrisy of the uk and the us government in picking and choosing the countries that they want to accuse of " undemocratic " behaviour , while staying quiet about the repressive regimes that they feel they can benefit from .
i just wish i could do something .
mark waghorn , london as i watched this , i could n't help wondering exactly why the police allowed such unrestricted filming .
some explanation would have been helpful .
it also seemed that all of the opposition supporters spoke only russian , while all the government supporters spoke a mixture of russian and azeri .
this may have just been a coincidence during post-production , or it may have had some political significance .
again , explanation would have been helpful .
programmes earlier in the series have been excellent , but i 'm afraid this one left me feeling i had n't been told the whole story .
ian kemmish , biggleswade western powers should not stand by and allow this situation to continue in azerbaijan .
our government has the influence , power and support to make a difference for these people who want democracy .
the freedom block are protesting peacefully now but faced with that degree of violence from the government i would imagine it is only a matter of time before their protest becomes violent , and who could blame them !
western powers could put a stop to this and it is the just and moral thing to do !
lee ransom , southampton what an eye-opener the programme was !
i watched with my husband and 19-year-old son and we were appalled at the disgusting behaviour of the president and his entourage .
well done to the freedom protesters ! !
if we could lodge our support we most certainly would .
mrs & mr k.dwyer , walsall excellent programme .
comparing the footage shown here with the police chiefs ' reports is enough to make you cry .
this is one issue with " good guys " and i feel ashamed not to have known more , and worse , to know that most people , including me , will do nothing .
pete brett , cambridge it is a tribute to the ever-changing modern world of global communications that this story can be brought to all our minds .
that we can not forget that out in the wider world there are those still fighting to get what we are so apathetically failing to demonstrate each general election : the right to pick your own destiny .
john c , edinburgh first of all i 'd like to comment on what an excellent piece of work making this programme .
what a disgrace it is that so-called democratic governments can get away with what they do .
more action needs to be done by the un to eradicate these problems in azerbaijan and similar countries across the world .
it would also hopefully stop another iraq war in the making .
john , middlesborough my heart goes out to those people in azerbaijan who , under the current regime , will never experience the freedoms we have here in the uk .
the police had no right to break up a non-violent protest - there was no resistance so it was uncalled for .
i believe the west should aid azerbaijan and it needs to be done soon .
democracy is not just a system of government but an ideal which results in freedom .
oliver burton , nottingham a fantastic programme. a moving and disturbing document of injustice in a so-called democracy .
how will the international community respond to this ?
how will justice be bought to the people of azerbaijan ?
chris simpson , southampton absolutely appalling .
why is more not done to support democracy in azerbaijan as democracy is being supported in iraq and afghanistan ! !
mehr , manchester azerbaijan is likely to be a difficult and interesting country over the coming years .
oil production of 1 million barrels a day - more than 15 times the world 's oil demand - will not only bring in a lot of money , but some challenging paradoxes .
first , how is the ruling elite going to stop enough of that money filtering down to the people ?
second , how is the west -lrb- notably the us -rrb- going to allow the instability that is democracy , to take place in all but a sham ?
i am optimistic - the changes that have happened in georgia must spill over the border into azerbaijan , it 's just a matter of time .
but i feel for the poor people who suffer under the maladminstration and ineptitude that is the current government .
we have to continue speaking out the truth in that country , and help them whenever we can .

the freedom block are protesting peacefully now but faced with that degree of violence from the government i would imagine it is only a matter of time before their protest becomes violent , and who could blame them !
western powers could put a stop to this and it is the just and moral thing to do !
lee ransom , southampton what an eye-opener the programme was !
i watched with my husband and 19-year-old son and we were appalled at the disgusting behaviour of the president and his entourage .
well done to the freedom protesters ! !
if we could lodge our support we most certainly would .
mrs & mr k.dwyer , walsall excellent programme .
comparing the footage shown here with the police chiefs ' reports is enough to make you cry .
this is one issue with " good guys " and i feel ashamed not to have known more , and worse , to know that most people , including me , will do nothing .
pete brett , cambridge it is a tribute to the ever-changing modern world of global communications that this story can be brought to all our minds .
that we can not forget that out in the wider world there are those still fighting to get what we are so apathetically failing to demonstrate each general election : the right to pick your own destiny .
john c , edinburgh first of all i 'd like to comment on what an excellent piece of work making this programme .
what a disgrace it is that so-called democratic governments can get away with what they do .
more action needs to be done by the un to eradicate these problems in azerbaijan and similar countries across the world .
it would also hopefully stop another iraq war in the making .
john , middlesborough my heart goes out to those people in azerbaijan who , under the current regime , will never experience the freedoms we have here in the uk .
the police had no right to break up a non-violent protest - there was no resistance so it was uncalled for .
i believe the west should aid azerbaijan and it needs to be done soon .
democracy is not just a system of government but an ideal which results in freedom .
oliver burton , nottingham a fantastic programme. a moving and disturbing document of injustice in a so-called democracy .
how will the international community respond to this ?
how will justice be bought to the people of azerbaijan ?
chris simpson , southampton absolutely appalling .
why is more not done to support democracy in azerbaijan as democracy is being supported in iraq and afghanistan ! !
mehr , manchester azerbaijan is likely to be a difficult and interesting country over the coming years .
oil production of 1 million barrels a day - more than 15 times the world 's oil demand - will not only bring in a lot of money , but some challenging paradoxes .
first , how is the ruling elite going to stop enough of that money filtering down to the people ?
second , how is the west -lrb- notably the us -rrb- going to allow the instability that is democracy , to take place in all but a sham ?
i am optimistic - the changes that have happened in georgia must spill over the border into azerbaijan , it 's just a matter of time .
but i feel for the poor people who suffer under the maladminstration and ineptitude that is the current government .
we have to continue speaking out the truth in that country , and help them whenever we can .

thank you for your comments .
the comments published on this page reflect the balance of views we received .
" shame on you ! "
these words were spoken by the old lady as she picked up splintered and torn orange banners at the end of an appalling show of brute force by the police against a non-violent demonstration .
i felt ashamed that i knew little of the struggle for freedom and democracy that we take so much for granted .
thank you bbc for this enlightening and thought-provoking documentary .
sharon burns , manchester i 'd just like to say that this is one of the best documentaries i 've seen in a long time .
sair r , manchester i lived in azerbaijan for 7 years and i can definitely tell you that the situation is much differenet from the one shown .
the programme is very biased towards the opposition .
john earnes , london an inspiring piece that takes you to highs , hopes , and then punches you in the stomach with the sickening abuse of power .
my hopes are with the people of azerbaijan .
their fight for liberty and freedom was not in vain as the truth has shown through , and will take a thousand souls on this side of the world to new heights of enlightenment .
the people are with you .
fight for freedom !
tobias pattle , braintree hugely insightful programme that highlighted the issues confronting -lrb- young -rrb- people in azerbaijan .
history has shown that demonstrations and togetherness of society can overthrow oppressive regimes - i really hope the protestors in azerbaijan can continue to build in strength and numbers to eventually overthrow the government as has been seen elsewhere in eastern europe .
they should not give up - the more people that come around to their beliefs , the better the chance of overthrowing the existing regime .
andy tate , london having been born in hungary myself , i can emphasise with these very unfortunate people .
although i read about widespread vote rigging in the papers last year , the scale of shamelessness by the " governing " party , the absolutely unjust political system and the lack of freedom was still shocking .
the west should be ashamed of itself .
what 's more important : money or freedom ?
most westerners are lucky enough never to have experienced authoritarian regimes .
thomas , london i just want to commend you on producing such an inspiring show .
it was a well-balanced documentary that helped people see just how easy it is for a government with such an intimidating police force and massive media machine working behind it , to control elections and the people in general .
thank you for daring to show some reality that people do n't often get to see .
and well done to your camera man for managing to stay alive throughout the whole film .
anyway , keep up the good work .
joe , uk i just wanted to say what an excellent programme i watched this evening .
how to plan a revolution demonstrated the complete lack of democracy in azerbaijan and the complicity of the us .
although george bush claims to support the move to democracy in this area it is obviously only in the countries that suit the us .
i will be watching carefully to see what happens in azerbaijan and thank the bbc for bringing this serious issue to my attention .
sally hornung , dorking i was shocked and yet sadly unsurprised as i watched this programme and saw the western leaders turn away from a fight for freedom and democracy that does n't suit their needs .
i can only applaud the resilience and bravery of those that fight for true democracy and freedom in azerbaijan .
a fantastic , thought-provoking documentary on an underreported injustice .
well done this world .
ruth sullivan , london this is a shocking and depressing documentary about a vicious regime shamelessly violating every human right that we take for granted in this country .
it also exposes the hypocrisy of the uk and the us government in picking and choosing the countries that they want to accuse of " undemocratic " behaviour , while staying quiet about the repressive regimes that they feel they can benefit from .
i just wish i could do something .
mark waghorn , london as i watched this , i could n't help wondering exactly why the police allowed such unrestricted filming .
some explanation would have been helpful .
it also seemed that all of the opposition supporters spoke only russian , while all the government supporters spoke a mixture of russian and azeri .
this may have just been a coincidence during post-production , or it may have had some political significance .
again , explanation would have been helpful .
programmes earlier in the series have been excellent , but i 'm afraid this one left me feeling i had n't been told the whole story .
ian kemmish , biggleswade western powers should not stand by and allow this situation to continue in azerbaijan .

ruth sullivan , london this is a shocking and depressing documentary about a vicious regime shamelessly violating every human right that we take for granted in this country .
it also exposes the hypocrisy of the uk and the us government in picking and choosing the countries that they want to accuse of " undemocratic " behaviour , while staying quiet about the repressive regimes that they feel they can benefit from .
i just wish i could do something .
mark waghorn , london as i watched this , i could n't help wondering exactly why the police allowed such unrestricted filming .
some explanation would have been helpful .
it also seemed that all of the opposition supporters spoke only russian , while all the government supporters spoke a mixture of russian and azeri .
this may have just been a coincidence during post-production , or it may have had some political significance .
again , explanation would have been helpful .
programmes earlier in the series have been excellent , but i 'm afraid this one left me feeling i had n't been told the whole story .
ian kemmish , biggleswade western powers should not stand by and allow this situation to continue in azerbaijan .
our government has the influence , power and support to make a difference for these people who want democracy .
the freedom block are protesting peacefully now but faced with that degree of violence from the government i would imagine it is only a matter of time before their protest becomes violent , and who could blame them !
western powers could put a stop to this and it is the just and moral thing to do !
lee ransom , southampton what an eye-opener the programme was !
i watched with my husband and 19-year-old son and we were appalled at the disgusting behaviour of the president and his entourage .
well done to the freedom protesters ! !
if we could lodge our support we most certainly would .
mrs & mr k.dwyer , walsall excellent programme .
comparing the footage shown here with the police chiefs ' reports is enough to make you cry .
this is one issue with " good guys " and i feel ashamed not to have known more , and worse , to know that most people , including me , will do nothing .
pete brett , cambridge it is a tribute to the ever-changing modern world of global communications that this story can be brought to all our minds .
that we can not forget that out in the wider world there are those still fighting to get what we are so apathetically failing to demonstrate each general election : the right to pick your own destiny .
john c , edinburgh first of all i 'd like to comment on what an excellent piece of work making this programme .
what a disgrace it is that so-called democratic governments can get away with what they do .
more action needs to be done by the un to eradicate these problems in azerbaijan and similar countries across the world .
it would also hopefully stop another iraq war in the making .
john , middlesborough my heart goes out to those people in azerbaijan who , under the current regime , will never experience the freedoms we have here in the uk .
the police had no right to break up a non-violent protest - there was no resistance so it was uncalled for .
i believe the west should aid azerbaijan and it needs to be done soon .
democracy is not just a system of government but an ideal which results in freedom .
oliver burton , nottingham a fantastic programme. a moving and disturbing document of injustice in a so-called democracy .
how will the international community respond to this ?
how will justice be bought to the people of azerbaijan ?
chris simpson , southampton absolutely appalling .
why is more not done to support democracy in azerbaijan as democracy is being supported in iraq and afghanistan ! !
mehr , manchester azerbaijan is likely to be a difficult and interesting country over the coming years .
oil production of 1 million barrels a day - more than 15 times the world 's oil demand - will not only bring in a lot of money , but some challenging paradoxes .
first , how is the ruling elite going to stop enough of that money filtering down to the people ?
second , how is the west -lrb- notably the us -rrb- going to allow the instability that is democracy , to take place in all but a sham ?
i am optimistic - the changes that have happened in georgia must spill over the border into azerbaijan , it 's just a matter of time .
but i feel for the poor people who suffer under the maladminstration and ineptitude that is the current government .
we have to continue speaking out the truth in that country , and help them whenever we can .

as we mark africa malaria day on 25 april 2006 , what can we do to stop ourselves becoming infected with the disease ?
malaria is one of the world 's most deadly diseases .
it kills three times more children in africa than hiv and aids .
effective ways to stop malaria spreading include spraying homes with the controversial insecticide ddt as is done annually in parts of south africa , and the mass distribution of mosquito nets as recently happened in niger .
what do you think is the best way to stop malaria ?
what do you do at home to prevent your family becoming infected ?
what is your view on the use of ddt ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your comments : i can not believe that anyone still believes ddt is harmful .
south africa has successfully applied ddt in the kwazulu-natal province and reduced malaria cases from 40.000 to 3000 in 2002 .
i grew up in the cameroon in the 1960s in a house that was sprayed once a year with ddt before the ban and i am still healthy .
bee ebene , london i agree with the contributor from ghana .
when we keep our environment clean there is less of a problem with malaria .
my problem with mosquito nets is that they were developed without considering the weather in west africa .
in fact you can suffocate to death when you sleep under them on a very hot day .
patience arthur , accra , ghana first and foremost , i would like to strongly disagree with the comment from a fellow african living in finland .
to say " the west can never develop the proper remedy for malaria because its not a western problem " is to be defeatist .
after all did n't the west develop vaccines that eradicated smallpox and kept many other epidemics at bay ?
zumbi musiba , dar-es-salaam tanzania we have lost the sense of social responsibility holly hanson , uganda i was glad to hear richard tren , director of africa fighting malaria , who was on the radio debate on wednesday say that malaria is a public health problem .
i am currently writing a history of the city of kampala , and i have been struck by the contrast between the situation in the early 1950s , when malaria control was defined as a responsibility of the city council and health care was provided free , and the present , where responsibility is being placed on individuals .
kampala is a much larger city now , with much less control over housing , but we also have lost the sense of social responsibility .
holly hanson , kampala , uganda patient fees stop people -lrb- especially the poor -rrb- from using health services .
therefore one simple action to fight malaria should be to remove fees for nets , consultations , lab tests and effective anti-malarial drugs .
this policy is working well in south africa , uganda , zambia and malawi .
it should be replicated across the continent rob yates , kinshasa , democratic republic congo i 've had malaria at least 50 or more times in my life .
it is a deadly diseases .
in fact more deadly than hiv / aids , but less resources are dedicated to eradicating malaria than hiv / aids and bird flu .
is the poor funding and slow pace of research into eradicating the disease due to the fact that it is absent in western countries ?
to stop malaria , we must invest more resources into research , education , advocacy and action for change .
prince jusu nallo , sierra leone / canada mosquitoes comes from the rubbish we throw in gutters and dust bins .
they are uncared for , hence we get too much mosquitoes .
i advise all of us to try and keep our homes clean and even on the streets , we should learn to throw rubbish in public bins and not all over the streets .
fatmata baby sesay , conakry - guinea african leaders should challenge the african researchers to find local remedies kolawole raheem , finland african leaders should challenge the african researchers to find local remedies , to be supported by western medicine , where needed .
the west can never get the proper medicine to prevent or cure malaria in africa .
it is not their disease and their pharmaceutical companies are only interested in money !
kolawole raheem , finland the pharmaceutical industry should move rapidly in developing vaccine for malaria .
in the meantime , effective anti-malarial drugs , insecticide-treated bed nets , mosquito repellents -lrb- sprays , creams , ointments -rrb- should be made available , affordable and accessible to all vulnerable communities .
african governments should reach out rural areas where malaria is reaping havoc .
the western world has a moral obligation to prevent malaria-related deaths in africa .
thedious mapulanga , lusaka , zambia malaria was for all practical purposes under control throughout the world before ddt was incorrectly banned for the use of mosquito control .
the world bank has erred by placing a condition on loans that ddt is not to be used for mosquito control .
carl boehme , boise , idaho the same amount of investment that is allocated to fight aids should be available to fight malaria nkede lawrence , cameroon all african leaders have their heads on the aids pandemic , maybe because it 's more lucrative in terms of financial assistance .
the same amount of investment that is allocated to fight aids should be available to fight malaria .
this is an important issue because it 's mostly children who are most vulnerable .
nkede lawrence , yaounde , cameroon " prevention is always better than cure " .
we should keep our environment clean , avoid stagnant waters that breed mosquitoes , allow light passage into our rooms , use medicated nets and mosquito repellents such as the coils , paints , sprays and creams .
moreover , we should report symptoms to qualified medical personnel as soon as possible .
ibn jamel ibrahim , kumasi , ghana my 19 year old step-daughter died just under three months ago from cerebral malaria contracted whilst visiting her father in uganda for christmas .
the medical professionals all diagnosed flu .
the dangers of malaria are not fully recognised in the west - malaria is a killer , people must be made more aware .
john wehner , devon , england many people hold the belief that malaria does not kill africans .
they see it as a normal thing for a person to suffer malaria from time to time .
a change in this attitude will go a long way in stopping the problem in africa .
oluchi agatha okeke , lagos , nigeria why can these therapies not form the basis for producing an effective vaccine against this killer abdulai musa , lagos at the time of writing i am finishing a course of malaria treatment - the second in one month .
so too is my seven-year-old daughter .
why can these therapies not form the basis for producing an effective vaccine against this killer ?
abdulai musa , lagos , nigeria it is surprising that the sanitation in towns and cities is not being talked about perhaps because of the costs .
drains must be properly engineered , farms must be far off from dwellings .
dr chigbo okonkwo , united kingdom while living in tanzania i got malaria .
when visiting indonesia i found out that many believe that eating boiled papaya leaves will cure malaria .
personally i think that it is the bitterness of the leaves which enters the blood stream , that helps repeal the mosquitoes just as i heard that eating bananas will do the contrary : the sweetness attracts them .
chris gibson , rome , italy ddt is a no no , unless you want to risk the health of unborn children bob , maragoli , kenya in my homestead , we clear any stagnant water by digging channels that empty such " basins " that water collects , we also use nets and coils .
ddt is a no no , unless you want to risk the health of unborn children .
we also encourage people visiting to take malaria medicine prior and during their visits .
bob , maragoli , kenya in the days of ddt malaria was virtually eradicated worldwide john gill , south africa we have to allow the use of ddt , there is not one single provable instance of death due to the use of ddt .
in the days of ddt malaria was virtually eradicated worldwide .
john gill , cape town , south africa malaria was eradicated in the united states more than 50 years ago .
it is time the developed world united to rid africa of malaria by utilizing the same measures used in the u.s. and europe to control mosquitoes .
these measures include controlling breeding grounds , improving drainage , and using insecticide spray .
ddt is safe when used properly and should be available to african nations .
in the meantime , mosquito nets should be given to all mothers .
kelly dahlberg , memphis , usa perhaps one of the major universities -lrb- or a combination of -rrb- could mutate a sterile male mosquito to mate with the females , thereby slowing down the tremendous insect infestation .
dominador tomate , california , usa african countries should subsidised medicines and mosquito nets .
for example kenya subsidised treated nets which used to cost about ksh .
400 -lrb- about us $ 5.70 -rrb- to ksh .
50 -lrb- about us $ 0.70 -rrb- .
it was only for pregnant mothers and young children under five years of age and was n't enough .
the government should also do the same with malaria medicines .
rono peter , nairobi , kenya .
in my country nurses do n't like to give free nets offered by the government to pregnant women , they will instead ask for payment , hence poor women go without these nets .
eric mbumbouh , bamenda , cameroon it 's scary .
ronald ross won the 2nd ever nobel prize for medicine in 1902 for his work on this killer disease and it 's vector , the anopheles mosquito .
here we are over 100 years later still trying to eradicate a killer that kills more , but gets less publicity , than aids and even bird flu which has so far killed a mere handful of humans .
why ?
do n't we care ?
or are we just too wrapped up in supposed threats to westerners ?
alastair ross , aberdeenshire , scotland i think we must find ways to eradicate mosquitoes .
it 's such a great pain to suffer from malaria .
a.siddiq tanko , accra , ghana i always wear long-sleeved shirts sudhir bisht , nigeria first and foremost , i try to ensure that sunlight enters all the nooks and corners of my house by keeping all windows open for at least 1 hour every day .
mosquitoes thrive on dampness and darkness and exposure to sunlight drives them away .
similarly one must close all doors and windows much before the sunlight leaves the house .
i also always wear long-sleeved shirts and avoid wearing knickers or shorts .
it has been 16 long months in lagos and i have been successful in keeping malaria at bay .
so far that is !
sudhir bisht , lagos , nigeria i believe in getting rid of all the still waters that mosquitoes breed and introducing fish in ponds ; cutting of grass and fumigating all forest areas ; educating the people of the symptoms so early treatment is sought .
davidson , zimbabwe the only prevention for malaria is a change in our attitude .
we should clear and avoid stagnant waters around us , and stop stuffing our gutters with all kinds of garbage and leaving rubbish unattended to all over the place .
in short , we should all practice good hygiene to prevent catching any disease at all .
abubakar ibrahim , accra , ghana my grandmother always makes sure she has collected enough dry dung for the fire peter tuach , usa my family never worries about malaria because my grandmother knows how to deal with the situation .
she always makes sure that she collects enough dry dung for the fire that chase mosquitoes away from entering into our house .
peter tuach , minnesota , usa i grew up having malaria fever practically once in every month of the year !
before i left nigeria , the vogue was the use of certain preventive drugs on regular basis , like weekly or monthly .
somehow i just feel preventive medication is not the best , medication as a rule makes the liver work extra time .
yemi , middlesbrough , uk in my view the best way to stop malaria is the combined use of treated nets and insecticide .
i suggest this because net can only be used in bed and not around the house like the veranda .
the insecticide can be used both in and outside the house .
in the last three years my family has relied on both methods and it has not failed us .
stella omubo-pepple , port harcourt , nigeria there is no option but ddt while countries do not focus on finding a way to get rid of our muddy swamp urgo shanka , usa knowing the bad aspects of ddt for future generation we still use it .
when we use ddt to protect what is in front of us , we tend to forget there will not be a normal future .
i hate to accept there is no option but ddt while countries do not focus on finding a way to get rid of our muddy swamps .
urgo shanka , st. paul , usa if a vaccine is not developed , we have to mobilise the whole universe to eradicate still water by providing an underground drainage system .
taiwo olateju , edinburgh , scotland i do everything possible to avoid ddt omorodion osula , usa we use mosquito nets and coils which emits smoke to kill the mosquitoes .
i do everything possible to avoid ddt .
it could be harmful to one 's health on the long run .

effective ways to stop malaria spreading include spraying homes with the controversial insecticide ddt as is done annually in parts of south africa , and the mass distribution of mosquito nets as recently happened in niger .
what do you think is the best way to stop malaria ?
what do you do at home to prevent your family becoming infected ?
what is your view on the use of ddt ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your comments : i can not believe that anyone still believes ddt is harmful .
south africa has successfully applied ddt in the kwazulu-natal province and reduced malaria cases from 40.000 to 3000 in 2002 .
i grew up in the cameroon in the 1960s in a house that was sprayed once a year with ddt before the ban and i am still healthy .
bee ebene , london i agree with the contributor from ghana .
when we keep our environment clean there is less of a problem with malaria .
my problem with mosquito nets is that they were developed without considering the weather in west africa .
in fact you can suffocate to death when you sleep under them on a very hot day .
patience arthur , accra , ghana first and foremost , i would like to strongly disagree with the comment from a fellow african living in finland .
to say " the west can never develop the proper remedy for malaria because its not a western problem " is to be defeatist .
after all did n't the west develop vaccines that eradicated smallpox and kept many other epidemics at bay ?
zumbi musiba , dar-es-salaam tanzania we have lost the sense of social responsibility holly hanson , uganda i was glad to hear richard tren , director of africa fighting malaria , who was on the radio debate on wednesday say that malaria is a public health problem .
i am currently writing a history of the city of kampala , and i have been struck by the contrast between the situation in the early 1950s , when malaria control was defined as a responsibility of the city council and health care was provided free , and the present , where responsibility is being placed on individuals .
kampala is a much larger city now , with much less control over housing , but we also have lost the sense of social responsibility .
holly hanson , kampala , uganda patient fees stop people -lrb- especially the poor -rrb- from using health services .
therefore one simple action to fight malaria should be to remove fees for nets , consultations , lab tests and effective anti-malarial drugs .
this policy is working well in south africa , uganda , zambia and malawi .
it should be replicated across the continent rob yates , kinshasa , democratic republic congo i 've had malaria at least 50 or more times in my life .
it is a deadly diseases .
in fact more deadly than hiv / aids , but less resources are dedicated to eradicating malaria than hiv / aids and bird flu .
is the poor funding and slow pace of research into eradicating the disease due to the fact that it is absent in western countries ?
to stop malaria , we must invest more resources into research , education , advocacy and action for change .
prince jusu nallo , sierra leone / canada mosquitoes comes from the rubbish we throw in gutters and dust bins .
they are uncared for , hence we get too much mosquitoes .
i advise all of us to try and keep our homes clean and even on the streets , we should learn to throw rubbish in public bins and not all over the streets .
fatmata baby sesay , conakry - guinea african leaders should challenge the african researchers to find local remedies kolawole raheem , finland african leaders should challenge the african researchers to find local remedies , to be supported by western medicine , where needed .
the west can never get the proper medicine to prevent or cure malaria in africa .
it is not their disease and their pharmaceutical companies are only interested in money !
kolawole raheem , finland the pharmaceutical industry should move rapidly in developing vaccine for malaria .
in the meantime , effective anti-malarial drugs , insecticide-treated bed nets , mosquito repellents -lrb- sprays , creams , ointments -rrb- should be made available , affordable and accessible to all vulnerable communities .
african governments should reach out rural areas where malaria is reaping havoc .
the western world has a moral obligation to prevent malaria-related deaths in africa .
thedious mapulanga , lusaka , zambia malaria was for all practical purposes under control throughout the world before ddt was incorrectly banned for the use of mosquito control .
the world bank has erred by placing a condition on loans that ddt is not to be used for mosquito control .
carl boehme , boise , idaho the same amount of investment that is allocated to fight aids should be available to fight malaria nkede lawrence , cameroon all african leaders have their heads on the aids pandemic , maybe because it 's more lucrative in terms of financial assistance .
the same amount of investment that is allocated to fight aids should be available to fight malaria .
this is an important issue because it 's mostly children who are most vulnerable .
nkede lawrence , yaounde , cameroon " prevention is always better than cure " .
we should keep our environment clean , avoid stagnant waters that breed mosquitoes , allow light passage into our rooms , use medicated nets and mosquito repellents such as the coils , paints , sprays and creams .
moreover , we should report symptoms to qualified medical personnel as soon as possible .
ibn jamel ibrahim , kumasi , ghana my 19 year old step-daughter died just under three months ago from cerebral malaria contracted whilst visiting her father in uganda for christmas .
the medical professionals all diagnosed flu .
the dangers of malaria are not fully recognised in the west - malaria is a killer , people must be made more aware .
john wehner , devon , england many people hold the belief that malaria does not kill africans .
they see it as a normal thing for a person to suffer malaria from time to time .
a change in this attitude will go a long way in stopping the problem in africa .
oluchi agatha okeke , lagos , nigeria why can these therapies not form the basis for producing an effective vaccine against this killer abdulai musa , lagos at the time of writing i am finishing a course of malaria treatment - the second in one month .
so too is my seven-year-old daughter .
why can these therapies not form the basis for producing an effective vaccine against this killer ?
abdulai musa , lagos , nigeria it is surprising that the sanitation in towns and cities is not being talked about perhaps because of the costs .
drains must be properly engineered , farms must be far off from dwellings .
dr chigbo okonkwo , united kingdom while living in tanzania i got malaria .
when visiting indonesia i found out that many believe that eating boiled papaya leaves will cure malaria .
personally i think that it is the bitterness of the leaves which enters the blood stream , that helps repeal the mosquitoes just as i heard that eating bananas will do the contrary : the sweetness attracts them .
chris gibson , rome , italy ddt is a no no , unless you want to risk the health of unborn children bob , maragoli , kenya in my homestead , we clear any stagnant water by digging channels that empty such " basins " that water collects , we also use nets and coils .
ddt is a no no , unless you want to risk the health of unborn children .
we also encourage people visiting to take malaria medicine prior and during their visits .
bob , maragoli , kenya in the days of ddt malaria was virtually eradicated worldwide john gill , south africa we have to allow the use of ddt , there is not one single provable instance of death due to the use of ddt .
in the days of ddt malaria was virtually eradicated worldwide .
john gill , cape town , south africa malaria was eradicated in the united states more than 50 years ago .
it is time the developed world united to rid africa of malaria by utilizing the same measures used in the u.s. and europe to control mosquitoes .
these measures include controlling breeding grounds , improving drainage , and using insecticide spray .
ddt is safe when used properly and should be available to african nations .
in the meantime , mosquito nets should be given to all mothers .
kelly dahlberg , memphis , usa perhaps one of the major universities -lrb- or a combination of -rrb- could mutate a sterile male mosquito to mate with the females , thereby slowing down the tremendous insect infestation .
dominador tomate , california , usa african countries should subsidised medicines and mosquito nets .
for example kenya subsidised treated nets which used to cost about ksh .
400 -lrb- about us $ 5.70 -rrb- to ksh .
50 -lrb- about us $ 0.70 -rrb- .
it was only for pregnant mothers and young children under five years of age and was n't enough .
the government should also do the same with malaria medicines .
rono peter , nairobi , kenya .
in my country nurses do n't like to give free nets offered by the government to pregnant women , they will instead ask for payment , hence poor women go without these nets .
eric mbumbouh , bamenda , cameroon it 's scary .
ronald ross won the 2nd ever nobel prize for medicine in 1902 for his work on this killer disease and it 's vector , the anopheles mosquito .
here we are over 100 years later still trying to eradicate a killer that kills more , but gets less publicity , than aids and even bird flu which has so far killed a mere handful of humans .
why ?
do n't we care ?
or are we just too wrapped up in supposed threats to westerners ?
alastair ross , aberdeenshire , scotland i think we must find ways to eradicate mosquitoes .
it 's such a great pain to suffer from malaria .
a.siddiq tanko , accra , ghana i always wear long-sleeved shirts sudhir bisht , nigeria first and foremost , i try to ensure that sunlight enters all the nooks and corners of my house by keeping all windows open for at least 1 hour every day .
mosquitoes thrive on dampness and darkness and exposure to sunlight drives them away .
similarly one must close all doors and windows much before the sunlight leaves the house .
i also always wear long-sleeved shirts and avoid wearing knickers or shorts .
it has been 16 long months in lagos and i have been successful in keeping malaria at bay .
so far that is !
sudhir bisht , lagos , nigeria i believe in getting rid of all the still waters that mosquitoes breed and introducing fish in ponds ; cutting of grass and fumigating all forest areas ; educating the people of the symptoms so early treatment is sought .
davidson , zimbabwe the only prevention for malaria is a change in our attitude .
we should clear and avoid stagnant waters around us , and stop stuffing our gutters with all kinds of garbage and leaving rubbish unattended to all over the place .
in short , we should all practice good hygiene to prevent catching any disease at all .
abubakar ibrahim , accra , ghana my grandmother always makes sure she has collected enough dry dung for the fire peter tuach , usa my family never worries about malaria because my grandmother knows how to deal with the situation .
she always makes sure that she collects enough dry dung for the fire that chase mosquitoes away from entering into our house .
peter tuach , minnesota , usa i grew up having malaria fever practically once in every month of the year !
before i left nigeria , the vogue was the use of certain preventive drugs on regular basis , like weekly or monthly .
somehow i just feel preventive medication is not the best , medication as a rule makes the liver work extra time .
yemi , middlesbrough , uk in my view the best way to stop malaria is the combined use of treated nets and insecticide .
i suggest this because net can only be used in bed and not around the house like the veranda .
the insecticide can be used both in and outside the house .
in the last three years my family has relied on both methods and it has not failed us .
stella omubo-pepple , port harcourt , nigeria there is no option but ddt while countries do not focus on finding a way to get rid of our muddy swamp urgo shanka , usa knowing the bad aspects of ddt for future generation we still use it .
when we use ddt to protect what is in front of us , we tend to forget there will not be a normal future .
i hate to accept there is no option but ddt while countries do not focus on finding a way to get rid of our muddy swamps .
urgo shanka , st. paul , usa if a vaccine is not developed , we have to mobilise the whole universe to eradicate still water by providing an underground drainage system .
taiwo olateju , edinburgh , scotland i do everything possible to avoid ddt omorodion osula , usa we use mosquito nets and coils which emits smoke to kill the mosquitoes .
i do everything possible to avoid ddt .
it could be harmful to one 's health on the long run .

oluchi agatha okeke , lagos , nigeria " why can these therapies not form the basis for producing an effective vaccine against this killer " abdulai musa , lagos at the time of writing i am finishing a course of malaria treatment - the second in one month .
so too is my seven-year-old daughter .
why can these therapies not form the basis for producing an effective vaccine against this killer ?
abdulai musa , lagos , nigeria it is surprising that the sanitation in towns and cities is not being talked about perhaps because of the costs .
drains must be properly engineered , farms must be far off from dwellings .
dr chigbo okonkwo , united kingdom while living in tanzania i got malaria .
when visiting indonesia i found out that many believe that eating boiled papaya leaves will cure malaria .
personally i think that it is the bitterness of the leaves which enters the blood stream , that helps repeal the mosquitoes just as i heard that eating bananas will do the contrary : the sweetness attracts them .
chris gibson , rome , italy " ddt is a no no , unless you want to risk the health of unborn children " bob , maragoli , kenya in my homestead , we clear any stagnant water by digging channels that empty such " basins " that water collects , we also use nets and coils .
ddt is a no no , unless you want to risk the health of unborn children .
we also encourage people visiting to take malaria medicine prior and during their visits .
bob , maragoli , kenya " in the days of ddt malaria was virtually eradicated worldwide " john gill , south africa we have to allow the use of ddt , there is not one single provable instance of death due to the use of ddt .
in the days of ddt malaria was virtually eradicated worldwide .
john gill , cape town , south africa malaria was eradicated in the united states more than 50 years ago .
it is time the developed world united to rid africa of malaria by utilizing the same measures used in the u.s. and europe to control mosquitoes .
these measures include controlling breeding grounds , improving drainage , and using insecticide spray .
ddt is safe when used properly and should be available to african nations .
in the meantime , mosquito nets should be given to all mothers .
kelly dahlberg , memphis , usa perhaps one of the major universities -lrb- or a combination of -rrb- could mutate a sterile male mosquito to mate with the females , thereby slowing down the tremendous insect infestation .
dominador tomate , california , usa african countries should subsidised medicines and mosquito nets .
for example kenya subsidised treated nets which used to cost about ksh .
400 -lrb- about us $ 5.70 -rrb- to ksh .
50 -lrb- about us $ 0.70 -rrb- .
it was only for pregnant mothers and young children under five years of age and was n't enough .
the government should also do the same with malaria medicines .
rono peter , nairobi , kenya .
in my country nurses do n't like to give free nets offered by the government to pregnant women , they will instead ask for payment , hence poor women go without these nets .
eric mbumbouh , bamenda , cameroon it 's scary .
ronald ross won the 2nd ever nobel prize for medicine in 1902 for his work on this killer disease and it 's vector , the anopheles mosquito .
here we are over 100 years later still trying to eradicate a killer that kills more , but gets less publicity , than aids and even bird flu which has so far killed a mere handful of humans .
why ?
do n't we care ?
or are we just too wrapped up in supposed threats to westerners ?
alastair ross , aberdeenshire , scotland i think we must find ways to eradicate mosquitoes .
it 's such a great pain to suffer from malaria .
a.siddiq tanko , accra , ghana " i always wear long-sleeved shirts " sudhir bisht , nigeria first and foremost , i try to ensure that sunlight enters all the nooks and corners of my house by keeping all windows open for at least 1 hour every day .
mosquitoes thrive on dampness and darkness and exposure to sunlight drives them away .
similarly one must close all doors and windows much before the sunlight leaves the house .
i also always wear long-sleeved shirts and avoid wearing knickers or shorts .
it has been 16 long months in lagos and i have been successful in keeping malaria at bay .
so far that is !
sudhir bisht , lagos , nigeria i believe in getting rid of all the still waters that mosquitoes breed and introducing fish in ponds ; cutting of grass and fumigating all forest areas ; educating the people of the symptoms so early treatment is sought .
davidson , zimbabwe the only prevention for malaria is a change in our attitude .
we should clear and avoid stagnant waters around us , and stop stuffing our gutters with all kinds of garbage and leaving rubbish unattended to all over the place .
in short , we should all practice good hygiene to prevent catching any disease at all .
abubakar ibrahim , accra , ghana " my grandmother always makes sure she has collected enough dry dung for the fire " peter tuach , usa my family never worries about malaria because my grandmother knows how to deal with the situation .
she always makes sure that she collects enough dry dung for the fire that chase mosquitoes away from entering into our house .
peter tuach , minnesota , usa i grew up having malaria fever practically once in every month of the year !
before i left nigeria , the vogue was the use of certain preventive drugs on regular basis , like weekly or monthly .
somehow i just feel preventive medication is not the best , medication as a rule makes the liver work extra time .
yemi , middlesbrough , uk in my view the best way to stop malaria is the combined use of treated nets and insecticide .
i suggest this because net can only be used in bed and not around the house like the veranda .
the insecticide can be used both in and outside the house .
in the last three years my family has relied on both methods and it has not failed us .
stella omubo-pepple , port harcourt , nigeria " there is no option but ddt while countries do not focus on finding a way to get rid of our muddy swamp " urgo shanka , usa knowing the bad aspects of ddt for future generation we still use it .
when we use ddt to protect what is in front of us , we tend to forget there will not be a normal future .
i hate to accept there is no option but ddt while countries do not focus on finding a way to get rid of our muddy swamps .
urgo shanka , st. paul , usa if a vaccine is not developed , we have to mobilise the whole universe to eradicate still water by providing an underground drainage system .
taiwo olateju , edinburgh , scotland " i do everything possible to avoid ddt " omorodion osula , usa we use mosquito nets and coils which emits smoke to kill the mosquitoes .
i do everything possible to avoid ddt .
it could be harmful to one 's health on the long run .

more than 200 islanders turned out to a public meeting on wednesday night where development plans were outlined .
developers hope to buy the site from the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- and tempt tourists with a hotel and distillery .
' crucial moment ' highland-based entrepreneur frank strang and blackwood distillers chief executive caroline whitfield outlined their plans for the empty base at the meeting in partnership with shetland islands council .
mr strang , of military asset management -lrb- mam -rrb- , has a track record of creating new business opportunities out of disused military bases .
as a businessman you see and taste the opportunities frank strang military asset management his plan is to invest several million pounds into converting parts of the base into a whisky distillery .
the rest of the camp would then gradually be turned into an upmarket hotel with tourist facilities and office space .
the proposals were backed by the majority of those at the meeting .
unst community council chairman gordon thomson said : " this is a crucial moment for the community .
people are behind this proposal , but still find it a wee bit difficult to grasp since it is such a radical chance .
" i think the round of applause after the meeting was a very positive sign .
" we need to get going with things as soon as possible . "
mr strang said : " we live in an age now where people want to get away from the cities and can afford to come to places like unst .
" when i came to unst i fell immediately under the spell of the island .
as a businessman you see and taste the opportunities .
design teams " having been involved in tourism a long time ago i know what it is going to take .
but this place will sell itself .
there is something special about it . "
detailed plans are now being drawn up by design teams with a view to work starting on the new distillery later this year .
ms whitfield said : " we are going to attract people who have never thought before of coming to unst . "
the community is expected to meet again within the next few weeks to further discuss the changes on the cards for the island .
