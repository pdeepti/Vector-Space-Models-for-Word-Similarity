bremen are top dogs ahead of bayern munich and schalke . hosts nuremberg were left shaking their heads on sunday after a poor decision by referee markus merk helped bielefeld earn a 1-all draw .
jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .
the draw dropped nuremberg to sixth place in the table . sunday 's other match between hosts cottbus and dortmund got off to a furious start with both sides scoring in the first three minutes .
dortmund then took command on goals by markus brzenska and alexander frei .
cottbus got one back on a late penalty , but that was little more than window dressing .
dortmund 's 3-2 win moves them up to seventh in the standings , while in cottbus the fight against relegation is underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego and naldo hooked up for a big 6-0 win on saturday , bremen moved atop the league with a 6-0 hammering of bochum on saturday while hertha berlin crashed 4-2 to champions bayern munich . bremen playmaker diego was the man of that first match , scoring the fourth himself in the 77th and feeding aaron hunt -lrb- eighth -rrb- , jurica vranjes -lrb- 75th -rrb- and clemens fritz -lrb- 88th -rrb- .

roy makaay , claudio pizarro and willy sagnol staked the hosts to a 3-nil lead before hertha 's malik fathi and marco pantelic drew hertha close .
podolski 's match clincher was his first league goal since a summer move from cologne . " it was great to see how the forwards were playing , " said munich coach felix magath . " you could see that the three can play together .
it was a joy to watch the team over certain periods . " but last season 's champions still trail bremen on goal-difference in the standings as both have 13 points along with schalke .
hertha , who had led the league before the weekend , drop back to nineth in the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart celebrated their first home win of the season schalke won 2-1 against 10-man hamburg , continuing the early collapse of what many thought would be one of the teams to watch this season and increasing the pressure on hamburg trainer thomas doll to get the team out of 17th place soon . stuttgart got their first home victory of the season , 3-0 over 10-man bayer leverkusen , borussia mönchengladbach defeated wolfsburg 3-1 .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union . " i disagree very clearly with president bush when he says that turkey must join europe for security policy reasons , " stoiber said .
" i say , bring nicaragua into the us and then we can talk about it . " " take off your headscarves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said that turkey 's eu membership depends on resolving ties to cyprus the conservative leader appealed to the muslims in germany to distance themselves from terror and violence and to integrate into daily german culture .
about 3.5 million muslims live in germany , 2.5 million of whom are turkish . stoiber 's appeal coincided with statements from german politicians with turkish roots who called for muslim women in germany to stop wearing headscarves . " you live here , so take off your headscarves , " parliamentarian ekin deligöz -lrb- green party -rrb- told bild am sonntag . stoiber lashed out at spd at the csu party convention saturday , edmund stoiber accused the social democrats , which make up the governing coalition together with the cdu and csu , of blocking reforms and being disloyal to chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck is party leader for the spd " we could achieve considerably more progress in berlin if the spd did n't put the brakes on so many issues , " said the bavarian premier , mentioning in particular the hartz iv labor market reform , the renewal of corporate tax and the energy policy . he was particularly critical of kurt beck , spd chairman and governor of north rhine- westphalia , saying his small state had much higher debts than the large state of bavaria . " mr. beck should do his homework before setting his sights higher , " said stoiber , referring to beck 's potential candidacy for the chancellorship in 2009 . csu losing public support members of the spd responded defensively to stoiber 's criticism . " we will continue to experience in the future that stoiber is the greatest security risk for the grand coalition , " said florian pronold , deputy state leader for the spd in bavaria .
" with his escape from berlin and his fickleness in the health reform , stoiber himself is responsible for the fact that he and his party have lost significance . " indeed , public support for the csu has dropped under the symbolic 50 percent mark in bavaria , where the conservative catholic party has governed alone since the mid-1960s . in addition , a poll by zdf television published friday showed that only 24 percent of germans believe stoiber and merkel have a good working relationship , while 43 percent see merkel and beck 's working relationship as positive . stoiber , who lost the 2002 general election , has carved out a reputation as being fickle by repeatedly criticizing health reform proposals from the cdu and spd .
he faces re-election in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politician 's blasphemy plan gets cool reception bavaria 's conservative premier stoiber recently proposed tightening germany 's blasphemy laws .

bremen are top dogs ahead of bayern munich and schalke . hosts nuremberg were left shaking their heads on sunday after a poor decision by referee markus merk helped bielefeld earn a 1-all draw .
jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .
the draw dropped nuremberg to sixth place in the table . sunday 's other match between hosts cottbus and dortmund got off to a furious start with both sides scoring in the first three minutes .
dortmund then took command on goals by markus brzenska and alexander frei .
cottbus got one back on a late penalty , but that was little more than window dressing .

roy makaay , claudio pizarro and willy sagnol staked the hosts to a 3-nil lead before hertha 's malik fathi and marco pantelic drew hertha close .
podolski 's match clincher was his first league goal since a summer move from cologne . " it was great to see how the forwards were playing , " said munich coach felix magath . " you could see that the three can play together .
it was a joy to watch the team over certain periods . " but last season 's champions still trail bremen on goal-difference in the standings as both have 13 points along with schalke .
hertha , who had led the league before the weekend , drop back to nineth in the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart celebrated their first home win of the season schalke won 2-1 against 10-man hamburg , continuing the early collapse of what many thought would be one of the teams to watch this season and increasing the pressure on hamburg trainer thomas doll to get the team out of 17th place soon . stuttgart got their first home victory of the season , 3-0 over 10-man bayer leverkusen , borussia mönchengladbach defeated wolfsburg 3-1 .

bremen are top dogs ahead of bayern munich and schalke . hosts nuremberg were left shaking their heads on sunday after a poor decision by referee markus merk helped bielefeld earn a 1-all draw .
jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .
the draw dropped nuremberg to sixth place in the table . sunday 's other match between hosts cottbus and dortmund got off to a furious start with both sides scoring in the first three minutes .
dortmund then took command on goals by markus brzenska and alexander frei .
cottbus got one back on a late penalty , but that was little more than window dressing .
dortmund 's 3-2 win moves them up to seventh in the standings , while in cottbus the fight against relegation is underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego and naldo hooked up for a big 6-0 win on saturday , bremen moved atop the league with a 6-0 hammering of bochum on saturday while hertha berlin crashed 4-2 to champions bayern munich . bremen playmaker diego was the man of that first match , scoring the fourth himself in the 77th and feeding aaron hunt -lrb- eighth -rrb- , jurica vranjes -lrb- 75th -rrb- and clemens fritz -lrb- 88th -rrb- .
michael schulz and naldo scored the other bremen goals in the 60th and 90th , respectively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans hope that they 're on their way to another title german international lukas podolski finally scored for munich in the win over hertha .
roy makaay , claudio pizarro and willy sagnol staked the hosts to a 3-nil lead before hertha 's malik fathi and marco pantelic drew hertha close .
podolski 's match clincher was his first league goal since a summer move from cologne . " it was great to see how the forwards were playing , " said munich coach felix magath . " you could see that the three can play together .
it was a joy to watch the team over certain periods . " but last season 's champions still trail bremen on goal-difference in the standings as both have 13 points along with schalke .
hertha , who had led the league before the weekend , drop back to nineth in the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart celebrated their first home win of the season schalke won 2-1 against 10-man hamburg , continuing the early collapse of what many thought would be one of the teams to watch this season and increasing the pressure on hamburg trainer thomas doll to get the team out of 17th place soon . stuttgart got their first home victory of the season , 3-0 over 10-man bayer leverkusen , borussia mönchengladbach defeated wolfsburg 3-1 .

but in berlin , the first pornography film festival is changing that . they 're not exactly the sorts of movies you 'll find down at the local multiplex .
there is " sexual sushi " and " trannyfags , " " bulldogs in the whitehouse " and " naked over the fence . "
but most are showing in mainstream cinemas around berlin this week during a film festival focusing squarely on the erotic . " pornography itself is not a problem , it 's only made into one , " jürgen brüning , a filmmaker and producer and organizer of the first " pornfilmfestival " told dpa news service .
" we want the festival to help get rid of pornography 's filthy image . " not that the festival is exactly kid friendly ; there will be lots of sex on show .
but brüning and other participants are interested in looking at all the different aspects of sex on celluloid , from the hard-core version focusing on a only few body parts all the way to films that have a full narrative arc - it 's just that these do n't fade to black when the physical interaction starts getting hot and heavy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally scheduled for four days , the festival has stretched out to a month " the basic question posed at this festival is : ' what is pornography ?

about 50 percent of the films in the show are simply discussions about sexuality . " broad spectrum while there might be little on offer during the festival 's four days of screenings that will appeal to many catholic bishops , there is a wide palette of movies that cover most of the sexual spectrum . " american stag " documents the development of adult film industry in the united states ; a series called " dutch pearls " features controversial 70s-era films from the netherlands , including a work by paul verhoeven , now a well-known hollywood director .
a collection of movies from japan will strike many from the west as dancing on the outer edges of sexuality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian porn is one of the more exotic servings on offer curator brüning tried to strike a balance of films that would appeal to both straight and gay audiences , as well as those somewhere in between .
he also wanted to screen works that would appeal to both men and women , who often have different views on what is erotic . " most of the pornography aimed at heterosexual men is not very woman-friendly , " said laura meritt , an author , shop owner and self-proclaimed sex activist who is taking part in the festival .
" we want to show that there are different ways to show sex on the screen , because right now , there 's a lot of crap out there . " unexpected success the amount of interest in the festival has surprised its organizers , höfner said .
what started off as a volunteer-run , four-day festival with no budget scheduled to start on oct .
18 was eventually expanded to the entire month of october , as seminars , workshops and additional films around sex and sexuality were added at various venues around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from raunch to erotica - the spectrum is covered individuals well known in the alternative porn industry , such as performance artist annie sprinkle from san francisco or canadian punk porn film director bruce labruce have come for screenings , workshops and performances . according to höfner , there have been no complaints about the festival from parties who feel bringing pornography to the movie theater around the corner is a step too far .

that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine river and pan for gold .
with a little luck , they bring slivers of the precious metal home with them . neuenburg , a city on the rhine river , has the mood of a gold rush town on saturdays .
that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine to learn the art of panning for gold . with a little luck , at the end of the day they bring precious metal back home with them . a little known fact : there really is gold in germany 's rhine .
you 're not likely to find coins or goblets , " but one is guaranteed to find at least little flecks of gold , " said hobby gold prospector franz-josef andorf . in neuenburg , andorf teaches a class for locals and tourists interested in gold panning . a golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this gold nugget was found in switzerland " this is a totally thrilling feeling , " said helga maier-garlipp , who is taking her first course with andorf .
she 's lucky : standing at the bank of the rhine , her hand holds several wafer-thin gold flecks . the rhine deposits more gold in neuenburg than in the rest of germany , mayor joachim schuster says with pride .
the precious metal comes from a geological formation in switzerland and gets moved down several rivers to the rhine .
the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 16.10.2006 german soccer referee suspended in anti-semitism incident großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite awareness campaigns , racism 's still a problem for german soccer the berlin soccer association has permanently barred a referee after accusations that he did nothing to prevent fans from chanting anti-semitic slogans at an amateur match . the decision comes after a match on sept .
26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .

that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine to learn the art of panning for gold . with a little luck , at the end of the day they bring precious metal back home with them . a little known fact : there really is gold in germany 's rhine .
you 're not likely to find coins or goblets , " but one is guaranteed to find at least little flecks of gold , " said hobby gold prospector franz-josef andorf . in neuenburg , andorf teaches a class for locals and tourists interested in gold panning . a golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this gold nugget was found in switzerland " this is a totally thrilling feeling , " said helga maier-garlipp , who is taking her first course with andorf .
she 's lucky : standing at the bank of the rhine , her hand holds several wafer-thin gold flecks . the rhine deposits more gold in neuenburg than in the rest of germany , mayor joachim schuster says with pride .
the precious metal comes from a geological formation in switzerland and gets moved down several rivers to the rhine .
the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .
the class is not meant for professional treasure seekers . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rejuvenating the rhine river a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .

that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine river and pan for gold .
with a little luck , they bring slivers of the precious metal home with them . neuenburg , a city on the rhine river , has the mood of a gold rush town on saturdays .
that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine to learn the art of panning for gold . with a little luck , at the end of the day they bring precious metal back home with them . a little known fact : there really is gold in germany 's rhine .
you 're not likely to find coins or goblets , " but one is guaranteed to find at least little flecks of gold , " said hobby gold prospector franz-josef andorf . in neuenburg , andorf teaches a class for locals and tourists interested in gold panning . a golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this gold nugget was found in switzerland " this is a totally thrilling feeling , " said helga maier-garlipp , who is taking her first course with andorf .
she 's lucky : standing at the bank of the rhine , her hand holds several wafer-thin gold flecks . the rhine deposits more gold in neuenburg than in the rest of germany , mayor joachim schuster says with pride .
the precious metal comes from a geological formation in switzerland and gets moved down several rivers to the rhine .
the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .
the class is not meant for professional treasure seekers . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rejuvenating the rhine river a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .

" when we designed the car we were aware that we might be opening ourselves up to legal action , " said jerry chen , sales manager for cmec , which is usually involved in importing and exporting machine tools .

" the chinese smart has seven generators instead of just four , he said . legal battle begins german smart car manufacturer daimlerchrysler is trying to stop cmec from selling the copycat vehicle and has demanded that its external appearance be changed . chen said that alterations have already been made to the front end and trunk .
he added that " the entire impression is now very different , " though photos that have popped up in recent weeks on internet forums and smart-fan sites reveal that the chinese city smart is practically identical to its european twin . whether or not cmec 's electric smart will be released on the broader european market will depend on whether or not they are deemed legal .
daimlerchrysler 's lawyers are currently looking into what legal steps can be taken .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.10.2006 germany concerned about new " under-class " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans feel they 've been left behind german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .
the study added fire to a debate about the so-called " under-class " sparked by kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . " germany has an increasing problem .
some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .

at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .

at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .
the study added fire to a debate about the so-called " under-class " sparked by kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . " germany has an increasing problem .
some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .
" there are far too many people in germany who have lost hope that they will advance in society , " he said . parents in poor families used to live by the notion that their " children should have it better , " but that attitude was increasingly disappearing , he said .
under-class or no some politicians responded to the study by blaming increasing poverty and a sense of desperation among germans due to the failures of labor market reforms introduced by the previous government under spd chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needy people waiting for food handouts in munich party-colleague stefan hilsberg told the tagesspiegel paper that the policies " deluded people into thinking that anybody could get a job as long as they are both challenged and supported . " as the term " under-class " gained currency over the course of the debate , the fes stressed on monday the study had in no way discussed it .
volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .
" i prefer talking about ' people with social and integration problems , " ' kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung paper .
" we have to address the problems that these people are confronted with . " some of those problems are likely to be unemployment , a lack of education and poor child-care opportunities . education crucial the issue of a split in society was something that concerned everyone , said chancellor angela merkel on monday .
" but we will not accept it , " she stressed . the chancellor said the central issue was to make sure that children had the same opportunities from the start .
a child 's early school career was decisive for its future education and thus for its chances on the labor market , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are the growing class of poor in germany " a large proportion of young people have never had a chance to learn that there are rules in life you have to abide by , " yvonne pekuhn , who works at a job placement center in berlin , told dw-radio . educational policies in germany have gone wrong , she said , and many young people " have never learned to have aims and objectives worth striving for .

jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .
the draw dropped nuremberg to sixth place in the table . sunday 's other match between hosts cottbus and dortmund got off to a furious start with both sides scoring in the first three minutes .
dortmund then took command on goals by markus brzenska and alexander frei .

podolski 's match clincher was his first league goal since a summer move from cologne . " it was great to see how the forwards were playing , " said munich coach felix magath . " you could see that the three can play together .
it was a joy to watch the team over certain periods . " but last season 's champions still trail bremen on goal-difference in the standings as both have 13 points along with schalke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 16.10.2006 german soccer referee suspended in anti-semitism incident großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite awareness campaigns , racism 's still a problem for german soccer the berlin soccer association has permanently barred a referee after accusations that he did nothing to prevent fans from chanting anti-semitic slogans at an amateur match . the decision comes after a match on sept .
26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .
the latest replica , an electric smart car set enter the market soon , has stirred up legal controversy in europe . last month , 13 million illegal videos and cds were destroyed in china as a symbolic rejection of copyright violation .
but now it seems that copying has been taken to the next level . a duplicate version of the smart fortwo has been produced by the chinese company cmec in the city of suzhou and has already appeared in hungary and great britain .
starting in 2007 , it is to be sold for 4,200 euros -lrb- $ 5,250 -rrb- under the name city smart . " when we designed the car we were aware that we might be opening ourselves up to legal action , " said jerry chen , sales manager for cmec , which is usually involved in importing and exporting machine tools .
" that 's why we 've imitated the outside but concentrated on making the interior look different . " not for the freeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirating cds and dvds has been common in china the major difference , however , is not the car 's appearance but its engine .
it has an electric motor that can only propel the vehicle up to 55 kilometers per hour -lrb- 34 miles per hour -rrb- , hence the name city smart . the standard petrol-powered smart fortwo reaches a top speed of 135 kilometers per hour , according to germany 's autobild magazine . " we 've had electric cars in china for the last 10 years , " chen said .
" there 's nothing special about the technology any more .
it 's mainly used for small vehicles like on golf courses , but you can use it in bigger vehicles if you improve the motor . " the chinese smart has seven generators instead of just four , he said . legal battle begins german smart car manufacturer daimlerchrysler is trying to stop cmec from selling the copycat vehicle and has demanded that its external appearance be changed . chen said that alterations have already been made to the front end and trunk .
he added that " the entire impression is now very different , " though photos that have popped up in recent weeks on internet forums and smart-fan sites reveal that the chinese city smart is practically identical to its european twin . whether or not cmec 's electric smart will be released on the broader european market will depend on whether or not they are deemed legal .
daimlerchrysler 's lawyers are currently looking into what legal steps can be taken .
daimlerchrysler plans to introduce its own smart fortwo successor in march 2007 .
after heavy losses recently , the smart car division hopes for a financial recovery with the more comfortable two-seater . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tiny smart car to challenge giants in us market daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle .

" of course we fully back " the sanctions agreed to in the un security council on saturday , european commission president jose manuel barroso told bbc television during a visit to london . " they are really important for the credibility of the international community because what 's happening in north korea is not only very bad and very dangerous for the region , but for the world , " he said . the development in pyongyang " raises the question of proliferation of nuclear technology and -lrb- the -rrb- possibility of north korea selling that technology to terrorist groups , " barroso added .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union . " i disagree very clearly with president bush when he says that turkey must join europe for security policy reasons , " stoiber said .
" i say , bring nicaragua into the us and then we can talk about it . " " take off your headscarves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said that turkey 's eu membership depends on resolving ties to cyprus the conservative leader appealed to the muslims in germany to distance themselves from terror and violence and to integrate into daily german culture .
about 3.5 million muslims live in germany , 2.5 million of whom are turkish . stoiber 's appeal coincided with statements from german politicians with turkish roots who called for muslim women in germany to stop wearing headscarves . " you live here , so take off your headscarves , " parliamentarian ekin deligöz -lrb- green party -rrb- told bild am sonntag . stoiber lashed out at spd at the csu party convention saturday , edmund stoiber accused the social democrats , which make up the governing coalition together with the cdu and csu , of blocking reforms and being disloyal to chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck is party leader for the spd " we could achieve considerably more progress in berlin if the spd did n't put the brakes on so many issues , " said the bavarian premier , mentioning in particular the hartz iv labor market reform , the renewal of corporate tax and the energy policy . he was particularly critical of kurt beck , spd chairman and governor of north rhine- westphalia , saying his small state had much higher debts than the large state of bavaria . " mr. beck should do his homework before setting his sights higher , " said stoiber , referring to beck 's potential candidacy for the chancellorship in 2009 . csu losing public support members of the spd responded defensively to stoiber 's criticism . " we will continue to experience in the future that stoiber is the greatest security risk for the grand coalition , " said florian pronold , deputy state leader for the spd in bavaria .
" with his escape from berlin and his fickleness in the health reform , stoiber himself is responsible for the fact that he and his party have lost significance . " indeed , public support for the csu has dropped under the symbolic 50 percent mark in bavaria , where the conservative catholic party has governed alone since the mid-1960s . in addition , a poll by zdf television published friday showed that only 24 percent of germans believe stoiber and merkel have a good working relationship , while 43 percent see merkel and beck 's working relationship as positive . stoiber , who lost the 2002 general election , has carved out a reputation as being fickle by repeatedly criticizing health reform proposals from the cdu and spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2006 eu supportive of north korea sanctions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world is harshly condemning north korea european union leaders say they fully back economic sanctions against north korea for its self-declared atomic test , adding that they will set a good precedent for dealing with iran . the eu is welcoming un sanctions imposed on north korea for its atomic test last week , saying a united stand bodes well for the world 's showdown with iran over its disputed nuclear program . " of course we fully back " the sanctions agreed to in the un security council on saturday , european commission president jose manuel barroso told bbc television during a visit to london . " they are really important for the credibility of the international community because what 's happening in north korea is not only very bad and very dangerous for the region , but for the world , " he said . the development in pyongyang " raises the question of proliferation of nuclear technology and -lrb- the -rrb- possibility of north korea selling that technology to terrorist groups , " barroso added .
" it 's very important we stand firm and support the united nations sanctions . " a fractions consensus the un text agreed to saturday demands elimination of all north korean programs related to weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles , a ban targeting missiles , tanks , large artillery systems , warships and combat aircraft , and provides for the inspection of cargo to and from the state . it further allows for a travel ban on officials working on such programs and the freezing of funds and economic assets linked to them , as well as slapping an embargo on luxury goods .
it specifically does not include any reference to military action . while the international community has broadly welcomed un sanctions against north korea , the consensus is still fractious . us president george w. bush said the unanimous security council resolution sent a clear message to north korean leader kim jong-il , a statement echoed in london , paris , tokyo and seoul . bildunterschrift : the un security council passed sanctions saturday but signs of the intense diplomatic haggling over the scale and nature of the sanctions were evident even after the text was approved in new york , with china - pyongyang 's closest ally - voicing reservations about provisions for inspecting cargo entering and leaving north korea . " we advocate that the un security council 's action has to show the firm position of the international community , but on the other hand it also should be conducive towards resolving the problems through peaceful dialogue , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told reporters . in contrast , japan , which had pushed for even tougher measures , said it was considering further action of its own to ratchet up the pressure on pyongyang . keeping the community united bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n. korean leader kim jong il wants more atomic tests when asked if the european union would push for firmer measures if north korea failed to respond to the sanctions , he replied : " we believe we have to keep the international community as united as possible . " we are very happy for instance with the tough position taken by china , " barroso said .
" that -lrb- chinese position -rrb- was good because this is also important for iran .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union . " i disagree very clearly with president bush when he says that turkey must join europe for security policy reasons , " stoiber said .

" " take off your headscarves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said that turkey 's eu membership depends on resolving ties to cyprus the conservative leader appealed to the muslims in germany to distance themselves from terror and violence and to integrate into daily german culture .
about 3.5 million muslims live in germany , 2.5 million of whom are turkish . stoiber 's appeal coincided with statements from german politicians with turkish roots who called for muslim women in germany to stop wearing headscarves . " you live here , so take off your headscarves , " parliamentarian ekin deligöz -lrb- green party -rrb- told bild am sonntag . stoiber lashed out at spd at the csu party convention saturday , edmund stoiber accused the social democrats , which make up the governing coalition together with the cdu and csu , of blocking reforms and being disloyal to chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck is party leader for the spd " we could achieve considerably more progress in berlin if the spd did n't put the brakes on so many issues , " said the bavarian premier , mentioning in particular the hartz iv labor market reform , the renewal of corporate tax and the energy policy . he was particularly critical of kurt beck , spd chairman and governor of north rhine- westphalia , saying his small state had much higher debts than the large state of bavaria . " mr. beck should do his homework before setting his sights higher , " said stoiber , referring to beck 's potential candidacy for the chancellorship in 2009 . csu losing public support members of the spd responded defensively to stoiber 's criticism . " we will continue to experience in the future that stoiber is the greatest security risk for the grand coalition , " said florian pronold , deputy state leader for the spd in bavaria .
" with his escape from berlin and his fickleness in the health reform , stoiber himself is responsible for the fact that he and his party have lost significance . " indeed , public support for the csu has dropped under the symbolic 50 percent mark in bavaria , where the conservative catholic party has governed alone since the mid-1960s . in addition , a poll by zdf television published friday showed that only 24 percent of germans believe stoiber and merkel have a good working relationship , while 43 percent see merkel and beck 's working relationship as positive . stoiber , who lost the 2002 general election , has carved out a reputation as being fickle by repeatedly criticizing health reform proposals from the cdu and spd .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .

volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .
" i prefer talking about ' people with social and integration problems , " ' kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung paper .
" we have to address the problems that these people are confronted with .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .
since the invitation was issued earlier this year , fears have grown of rising russian muscle-flexing . the west also knows that moscow can play a very strong energy card .
the clearest example of this came when russia cut gas to western neighbor ukraine on jan .
1 during a price dispute , with knock-on effects further west . if eu member states , and former soviet satellites , such as poland , the czech republic and baltic nations want the eu to confront putin over human rights , then " most of the big european capitals think it is not necessary to raise internal questions publicly , and not in the name of the eu , but bilaterally , " missiroli said . politkovskaya murder to be raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya 's murder shocked the world there is likely to be more friction when the european commission jose manuel barroso urges putin to ensure that those who murdered journalist anna politkovskaya are prosecuted .
barroso said sunday that he would push for an investigation and added that moscow 's " credibility " was at stake . " we want those who have assassinated mrs. politkovskaya - a great fighter for freedom of expression - we want them to be brought to justice , " barroso said .

but in berlin , the first pornography film festival is changing that . they 're not exactly the sorts of movies you 'll find down at the local multiplex .
there is " sexual sushi " and " trannyfags , " " bulldogs in the whitehouse " and " naked over the fence . "
but most are showing in mainstream cinemas around berlin this week during a film festival focusing squarely on the erotic . " pornography itself is not a problem , it 's only made into one , " jürgen brüning , a filmmaker and producer and organizer of the first " pornfilmfestival " told dpa news service .
" we want the festival to help get rid of pornography 's filthy image . " not that the festival is exactly kid friendly ; there will be lots of sex on show .
but brüning and other participants are interested in looking at all the different aspects of sex on celluloid , from the hard-core version focusing on a only few body parts all the way to films that have a full narrative arc - it 's just that these do n't fade to black when the physical interaction starts getting hot and heavy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally scheduled for four days , the festival has stretched out to a month " the basic question posed at this festival is : ' what is pornography ? " ' said michael höfner , the festival 's media spokesperson .
" it is different things to different people .
the young urban hipster will have a completely different view of the pornographic than will the catholic bishop or observant muslim .
about 50 percent of the films in the show are simply discussions about sexuality . " broad spectrum while there might be little on offer during the festival 's four days of screenings that will appeal to many catholic bishops , there is a wide palette of movies that cover most of the sexual spectrum . " american stag " documents the development of adult film industry in the united states ; a series called " dutch pearls " features controversial 70s-era films from the netherlands , including a work by paul verhoeven , now a well-known hollywood director .
a collection of movies from japan will strike many from the west as dancing on the outer edges of sexuality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian porn is one of the more exotic servings on offer curator brüning tried to strike a balance of films that would appeal to both straight and gay audiences , as well as those somewhere in between .
he also wanted to screen works that would appeal to both men and women , who often have different views on what is erotic . " most of the pornography aimed at heterosexual men is not very woman-friendly , " said laura meritt , an author , shop owner and self-proclaimed sex activist who is taking part in the festival .
" we want to show that there are different ways to show sex on the screen , because right now , there 's a lot of crap out there . " unexpected success the amount of interest in the festival has surprised its organizers , höfner said .
what started off as a volunteer-run , four-day festival with no budget scheduled to start on oct .
18 was eventually expanded to the entire month of october , as seminars , workshops and additional films around sex and sexuality were added at various venues around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from raunch to erotica - the spectrum is covered individuals well known in the alternative porn industry , such as performance artist annie sprinkle from san francisco or canadian punk porn film director bruce labruce have come for screenings , workshops and performances . according to höfner , there have been no complaints about the festival from parties who feel bringing pornography to the movie theater around the corner is a step too far . " anyway , in a way , pornography has already made it into the mainstream movies , " he said , citing the new film " shortbus " by john cameron mitchell or the british film " intimacy . " " today , " he said , " porn is chic . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's teen sex doctor how can i tell him i want more ?

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.10.2006 germany concerned about new " under-class " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans feel they 've been left behind german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .
the study added fire to a debate about the so-called " under-class " sparked by kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . " germany has an increasing problem .
some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .
" there are far too many people in germany who have lost hope that they will advance in society , " he said . parents in poor families used to live by the notion that their " children should have it better , " but that attitude was increasingly disappearing , he said .
under-class or no some politicians responded to the study by blaming increasing poverty and a sense of desperation among germans due to the failures of labor market reforms introduced by the previous government under spd chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needy people waiting for food handouts in munich party-colleague stefan hilsberg told the tagesspiegel paper that the policies " deluded people into thinking that anybody could get a job as long as they are both challenged and supported . " as the term " under-class " gained currency over the course of the debate , the fes stressed on monday the study had in no way discussed it .
volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .
" i prefer talking about ' people with social and integration problems , " ' kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung paper .
" we have to address the problems that these people are confronted with . " some of those problems are likely to be unemployment , a lack of education and poor child-care opportunities . education crucial the issue of a split in society was something that concerned everyone , said chancellor angela merkel on monday .
" but we will not accept it , " she stressed . the chancellor said the central issue was to make sure that children had the same opportunities from the start .
a child 's early school career was decisive for its future education and thus for its chances on the labor market , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are the growing class of poor in germany " a large proportion of young people have never had a chance to learn that there are rules in life you have to abide by , " yvonne pekuhn , who works at a job placement center in berlin , told dw-radio . educational policies in germany have gone wrong , she said , and many young people " have never learned to have aims and objectives worth striving for .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union . " i disagree very clearly with president bush when he says that turkey must join europe for security policy reasons , " stoiber said .
" i say , bring nicaragua into the us and then we can talk about it . " " take off your headscarves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said that turkey 's eu membership depends on resolving ties to cyprus the conservative leader appealed to the muslims in germany to distance themselves from terror and violence and to integrate into daily german culture .
about 3.5 million muslims live in germany , 2.5 million of whom are turkish . stoiber 's appeal coincided with statements from german politicians with turkish roots who called for muslim women in germany to stop wearing headscarves . " you live here , so take off your headscarves , " parliamentarian ekin deligöz -lrb- green party -rrb- told bild am sonntag . stoiber lashed out at spd at the csu party convention saturday , edmund stoiber accused the social democrats , which make up the governing coalition together with the cdu and csu , of blocking reforms and being disloyal to chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck is party leader for the spd " we could achieve considerably more progress in berlin if the spd did n't put the brakes on so many issues , " said the bavarian premier , mentioning in particular the hartz iv labor market reform , the renewal of corporate tax and the energy policy . he was particularly critical of kurt beck , spd chairman and governor of north rhine- westphalia , saying his small state had much higher debts than the large state of bavaria . " mr. beck should do his homework before setting his sights higher , " said stoiber , referring to beck 's potential candidacy for the chancellorship in 2009 . csu losing public support members of the spd responded defensively to stoiber 's criticism . " we will continue to experience in the future that stoiber is the greatest security risk for the grand coalition , " said florian pronold , deputy state leader for the spd in bavaria .
" with his escape from berlin and his fickleness in the health reform , stoiber himself is responsible for the fact that he and his party have lost significance . " indeed , public support for the csu has dropped under the symbolic 50 percent mark in bavaria , where the conservative catholic party has governed alone since the mid-1960s . in addition , a poll by zdf television published friday showed that only 24 percent of germans believe stoiber and merkel have a good working relationship , while 43 percent see merkel and beck 's working relationship as positive . stoiber , who lost the 2002 general election , has carved out a reputation as being fickle by repeatedly criticizing health reform proposals from the cdu and spd .

bremen are top dogs ahead of bayern munich and schalke . hosts nuremberg were left shaking their heads on sunday after a poor decision by referee markus merk helped bielefeld earn a 1-all draw .
jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .
since the invitation was issued earlier this year , fears have grown of rising russian muscle-flexing . the west also knows that moscow can play a very strong energy card .
the clearest example of this came when russia cut gas to western neighbor ukraine on jan .
1 during a price dispute , with knock-on effects further west . if eu member states , and former soviet satellites , such as poland , the czech republic and baltic nations want the eu to confront putin over human rights , then " most of the big european capitals think it is not necessary to raise internal questions publicly , and not in the name of the eu , but bilaterally , " missiroli said . politkovskaya murder to be raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya 's murder shocked the world there is likely to be more friction when the european commission jose manuel barroso urges putin to ensure that those who murdered journalist anna politkovskaya are prosecuted .
barroso said sunday that he would push for an investigation and added that moscow 's " credibility " was at stake . " we want those who have assassinated mrs. politkovskaya - a great fighter for freedom of expression - we want them to be brought to justice , " barroso said .
" it 's a question of credibility of the russian government ... to show that they are able to bring to justice those who make those hideous crimes . " we have an interest in having good relations with russia , but i believe russia also has an interest in having good relations with the european union , " barroso added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin seeks german help to modernize russian economy russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science .

corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .
the latest replica , an electric smart car set enter the market soon , has stirred up legal controversy in europe . last month , 13 million illegal videos and cds were destroyed in china as a symbolic rejection of copyright violation .
but now it seems that copying has been taken to the next level . a duplicate version of the smart fortwo has been produced by the chinese company cmec in the city of suzhou and has already appeared in hungary and great britain .
starting in 2007 , it is to be sold for 4,200 euros -lrb- $ 5,250 -rrb- under the name city smart . " when we designed the car we were aware that we might be opening ourselves up to legal action , " said jerry chen , sales manager for cmec , which is usually involved in importing and exporting machine tools .
" that 's why we 've imitated the outside but concentrated on making the interior look different . " not for the freeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirating cds and dvds has been common in china the major difference , however , is not the car 's appearance but its engine .
it has an electric motor that can only propel the vehicle up to 55 kilometers per hour -lrb- 34 miles per hour -rrb- , hence the name city smart . the standard petrol-powered smart fortwo reaches a top speed of 135 kilometers per hour , according to germany 's autobild magazine . " we 've had electric cars in china for the last 10 years , " chen said .
" there 's nothing special about the technology any more .
it 's mainly used for small vehicles like on golf courses , but you can use it in bigger vehicles if you improve the motor . " the chinese smart has seven generators instead of just four , he said . legal battle begins german smart car manufacturer daimlerchrysler is trying to stop cmec from selling the copycat vehicle and has demanded that its external appearance be changed . chen said that alterations have already been made to the front end and trunk .
he added that " the entire impression is now very different , " though photos that have popped up in recent weeks on internet forums and smart-fan sites reveal that the chinese city smart is practically identical to its european twin . whether or not cmec 's electric smart will be released on the broader european market will depend on whether or not they are deemed legal .
daimlerchrysler 's lawyers are currently looking into what legal steps can be taken .
daimlerchrysler plans to introduce its own smart fortwo successor in march 2007 .
after heavy losses recently , the smart car division hopes for a financial recovery with the more comfortable two-seater . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tiny smart car to challenge giants in us market daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .
since the invitation was issued earlier this year , fears have grown of rising russian muscle-flexing . the west also knows that moscow can play a very strong energy card .
the clearest example of this came when russia cut gas to western neighbor ukraine on jan .
1 during a price dispute , with knock-on effects further west . if eu member states , and former soviet satellites , such as poland , the czech republic and baltic nations want the eu to confront putin over human rights , then " most of the big european capitals think it is not necessary to raise internal questions publicly , and not in the name of the eu , but bilaterally , " missiroli said . politkovskaya murder to be raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya 's murder shocked the world there is likely to be more friction when the european commission jose manuel barroso urges putin to ensure that those who murdered journalist anna politkovskaya are prosecuted .
barroso said sunday that he would push for an investigation and added that moscow 's " credibility " was at stake . " we want those who have assassinated mrs. politkovskaya - a great fighter for freedom of expression - we want them to be brought to justice , " barroso said .
" it 's a question of credibility of the russian government ... to show that they are able to bring to justice those who make those hideous crimes .

but in berlin , the first pornography film festival is changing that . they 're not exactly the sorts of movies you 'll find down at the local multiplex .
there is " sexual sushi " and " trannyfags , " " bulldogs in the whitehouse " and " naked over the fence . "
but most are showing in mainstream cinemas around berlin this week during a film festival focusing squarely on the erotic . " pornography itself is not a problem , it 's only made into one , " jürgen brüning , a filmmaker and producer and organizer of the first " pornfilmfestival " told dpa news service .
" we want the festival to help get rid of pornography 's filthy image . " not that the festival is exactly kid friendly ; there will be lots of sex on show .
but brüning and other participants are interested in looking at all the different aspects of sex on celluloid , from the hard-core version focusing on a only few body parts all the way to films that have a full narrative arc - it 's just that these do n't fade to black when the physical interaction starts getting hot and heavy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally scheduled for four days , the festival has stretched out to a month " the basic question posed at this festival is : ' what is pornography ? " ' said michael höfner , the festival 's media spokesperson .
" it is different things to different people .
the young urban hipster will have a completely different view of the pornographic than will the catholic bishop or observant muslim .
about 50 percent of the films in the show are simply discussions about sexuality . " broad spectrum while there might be little on offer during the festival 's four days of screenings that will appeal to many catholic bishops , there is a wide palette of movies that cover most of the sexual spectrum . " american stag " documents the development of adult film industry in the united states ; a series called " dutch pearls " features controversial 70s-era films from the netherlands , including a work by paul verhoeven , now a well-known hollywood director .
a collection of movies from japan will strike many from the west as dancing on the outer edges of sexuality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian porn is one of the more exotic servings on offer curator brüning tried to strike a balance of films that would appeal to both straight and gay audiences , as well as those somewhere in between .
he also wanted to screen works that would appeal to both men and women , who often have different views on what is erotic . " most of the pornography aimed at heterosexual men is not very woman-friendly , " said laura meritt , an author , shop owner and self-proclaimed sex activist who is taking part in the festival .
" we want to show that there are different ways to show sex on the screen , because right now , there 's a lot of crap out there . " unexpected success the amount of interest in the festival has surprised its organizers , höfner said .
what started off as a volunteer-run , four-day festival with no budget scheduled to start on oct .
18 was eventually expanded to the entire month of october , as seminars , workshops and additional films around sex and sexuality were added at various venues around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from raunch to erotica - the spectrum is covered individuals well known in the alternative porn industry , such as performance artist annie sprinkle from san francisco or canadian punk porn film director bruce labruce have come for screenings , workshops and performances . according to höfner , there have been no complaints about the festival from parties who feel bringing pornography to the movie theater around the corner is a step too far . " anyway , in a way , pornography has already made it into the mainstream movies , " he said , citing the new film " shortbus " by john cameron mitchell or the british film " intimacy .

bremen are top dogs ahead of bayern munich and schalke . hosts nuremberg were left shaking their heads on sunday after a poor decision by referee markus merk helped bielefeld earn a 1-all draw .
jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .
the draw dropped nuremberg to sixth place in the table . sunday 's other match between hosts cottbus and dortmund got off to a furious start with both sides scoring in the first three minutes .
dortmund then took command on goals by markus brzenska and alexander frei .

but in berlin , the first pornography film festival is changing that . they 're not exactly the sorts of movies you 'll find down at the local multiplex .
there is " sexual sushi " and " trannyfags , " " bulldogs in the whitehouse " and " naked over the fence . "
but most are showing in mainstream cinemas around berlin this week during a film festival focusing squarely on the erotic . " pornography itself is not a problem , it 's only made into one , " jürgen brüning , a filmmaker and producer and organizer of the first " pornfilmfestival " told dpa news service .
" we want the festival to help get rid of pornography 's filthy image . " not that the festival is exactly kid friendly ; there will be lots of sex on show .
but brüning and other participants are interested in looking at all the different aspects of sex on celluloid , from the hard-core version focusing on a only few body parts all the way to films that have a full narrative arc - it 's just that these do n't fade to black when the physical interaction starts getting hot and heavy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally scheduled for four days , the festival has stretched out to a month " the basic question posed at this festival is : ' what is pornography ? " ' said michael höfner , the festival 's media spokesperson .
" it is different things to different people .
the young urban hipster will have a completely different view of the pornographic than will the catholic bishop or observant muslim .
about 50 percent of the films in the show are simply discussions about sexuality . " broad spectrum while there might be little on offer during the festival 's four days of screenings that will appeal to many catholic bishops , there is a wide palette of movies that cover most of the sexual spectrum . " american stag " documents the development of adult film industry in the united states ; a series called " dutch pearls " features controversial 70s-era films from the netherlands , including a work by paul verhoeven , now a well-known hollywood director .
a collection of movies from japan will strike many from the west as dancing on the outer edges of sexuality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian porn is one of the more exotic servings on offer curator brüning tried to strike a balance of films that would appeal to both straight and gay audiences , as well as those somewhere in between .
he also wanted to screen works that would appeal to both men and women , who often have different views on what is erotic . " most of the pornography aimed at heterosexual men is not very woman-friendly , " said laura meritt , an author , shop owner and self-proclaimed sex activist who is taking part in the festival .
" we want to show that there are different ways to show sex on the screen , because right now , there 's a lot of crap out there . " unexpected success the amount of interest in the festival has surprised its organizers , höfner said .
what started off as a volunteer-run , four-day festival with no budget scheduled to start on oct .
18 was eventually expanded to the entire month of october , as seminars , workshops and additional films around sex and sexuality were added at various venues around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from raunch to erotica - the spectrum is covered individuals well known in the alternative porn industry , such as performance artist annie sprinkle from san francisco or canadian punk porn film director bruce labruce have come for screenings , workshops and performances . according to höfner , there have been no complaints about the festival from parties who feel bringing pornography to the movie theater around the corner is a step too far . " anyway , in a way , pornography has already made it into the mainstream movies , " he said , citing the new film " shortbus " by john cameron mitchell or the british film " intimacy . " " today , " he said , " porn is chic . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's teen sex doctor how can i tell him i want more ?

jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .
the draw dropped nuremberg to sixth place in the table . sunday 's other match between hosts cottbus and dortmund got off to a furious start with both sides scoring in the first three minutes .
dortmund then took command on goals by markus brzenska and alexander frei .
cottbus got one back on a late penalty , but that was little more than window dressing .

it was a joy to watch the team over certain periods . " but last season 's champions still trail bremen on goal-difference in the standings as both have 13 points along with schalke .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .
since the invitation was issued earlier this year , fears have grown of rising russian muscle-flexing . the west also knows that moscow can play a very strong energy card .
the clearest example of this came when russia cut gas to western neighbor ukraine on jan .
1 during a price dispute , with knock-on effects further west . if eu member states , and former soviet satellites , such as poland , the czech republic and baltic nations want the eu to confront putin over human rights , then " most of the big european capitals think it is not necessary to raise internal questions publicly , and not in the name of the eu , but bilaterally , " missiroli said . politkovskaya murder to be raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya 's murder shocked the world there is likely to be more friction when the european commission jose manuel barroso urges putin to ensure that those who murdered journalist anna politkovskaya are prosecuted .
barroso said sunday that he would push for an investigation and added that moscow 's " credibility " was at stake . " we want those who have assassinated mrs. politkovskaya - a great fighter for freedom of expression - we want them to be brought to justice , " barroso said .
" it 's a question of credibility of the russian government ... to show that they are able to bring to justice those who make those hideous crimes .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .
since the invitation was issued earlier this year , fears have grown of rising russian muscle-flexing . the west also knows that moscow can play a very strong energy card .
the clearest example of this came when russia cut gas to western neighbor ukraine on jan .
1 during a price dispute , with knock-on effects further west . if eu member states , and former soviet satellites , such as poland , the czech republic and baltic nations want the eu to confront putin over human rights , then " most of the big european capitals think it is not necessary to raise internal questions publicly , and not in the name of the eu , but bilaterally , " missiroli said . politkovskaya murder to be raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya 's murder shocked the world there is likely to be more friction when the european commission jose manuel barroso urges putin to ensure that those who murdered journalist anna politkovskaya are prosecuted .
barroso said sunday that he would push for an investigation and added that moscow 's " credibility " was at stake . " we want those who have assassinated mrs. politkovskaya - a great fighter for freedom of expression - we want them to be brought to justice , " barroso said .
" it 's a question of credibility of the russian government ... to show that they are able to bring to justice those who make those hideous crimes . " we have an interest in having good relations with russia , but i believe russia also has an interest in having good relations with the european union , " barroso added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin seeks german help to modernize russian economy russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.10.2006 germany concerned about new " under-class " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans feel they 've been left behind german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .
the study added fire to a debate about the so-called " under-class " sparked by kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . " germany has an increasing problem .
some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .
" there are far too many people in germany who have lost hope that they will advance in society , " he said . parents in poor families used to live by the notion that their " children should have it better , " but that attitude was increasingly disappearing , he said .
under-class or no some politicians responded to the study by blaming increasing poverty and a sense of desperation among germans due to the failures of labor market reforms introduced by the previous government under spd chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needy people waiting for food handouts in munich party-colleague stefan hilsberg told the tagesspiegel paper that the policies " deluded people into thinking that anybody could get a job as long as they are both challenged and supported . " as the term " under-class " gained currency over the course of the debate , the fes stressed on monday the study had in no way discussed it .
volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .
" i prefer talking about ' people with social and integration problems , " ' kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung paper .
" we have to address the problems that these people are confronted with . " some of those problems are likely to be unemployment , a lack of education and poor child-care opportunities . education crucial the issue of a split in society was something that concerned everyone , said chancellor angela merkel on monday .
" but we will not accept it , " she stressed . the chancellor said the central issue was to make sure that children had the same opportunities from the start .
a child 's early school career was decisive for its future education and thus for its chances on the labor market , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are the growing class of poor in germany " a large proportion of young people have never had a chance to learn that there are rules in life you have to abide by , " yvonne pekuhn , who works at a job placement center in berlin , told dw-radio . educational policies in germany have gone wrong , she said , and many young people " have never learned to have aims and objectives worth striving for .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union .

about 3.5 million muslims live in germany , 2.5 million of whom are turkish . stoiber 's appeal coincided with statements from german politicians with turkish roots who called for muslim women in germany to stop wearing headscarves . " you live here , so take off your headscarves , " parliamentarian ekin deligöz -lrb- green party -rrb- told bild am sonntag . stoiber lashed out at spd at the csu party convention saturday , edmund stoiber accused the social democrats , which make up the governing coalition together with the cdu and csu , of blocking reforms and being disloyal to chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck is party leader for the spd " we could achieve considerably more progress in berlin if the spd did n't put the brakes on so many issues , " said the bavarian premier , mentioning in particular the hartz iv labor market reform , the renewal of corporate tax and the energy policy . he was particularly critical of kurt beck , spd chairman and governor of north rhine- westphalia , saying his small state had much higher debts than the large state of bavaria . " mr. beck should do his homework before setting his sights higher , " said stoiber , referring to beck 's potential candidacy for the chancellorship in 2009 . csu losing public support members of the spd responded defensively to stoiber 's criticism . " we will continue to experience in the future that stoiber is the greatest security risk for the grand coalition , " said florian pronold , deputy state leader for the spd in bavaria .
" with his escape from berlin and his fickleness in the health reform , stoiber himself is responsible for the fact that he and his party have lost significance . " indeed , public support for the csu has dropped under the symbolic 50 percent mark in bavaria , where the conservative catholic party has governed alone since the mid-1960s . in addition , a poll by zdf television published friday showed that only 24 percent of germans believe stoiber and merkel have a good working relationship , while 43 percent see merkel and beck 's working relationship as positive . stoiber , who lost the 2002 general election , has carved out a reputation as being fickle by repeatedly criticizing health reform proposals from the cdu and spd .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .

" of course we fully back " the sanctions agreed to in the un security council on saturday , european commission president jose manuel barroso told bbc television during a visit to london . " they are really important for the credibility of the international community because what 's happening in north korea is not only very bad and very dangerous for the region , but for the world , " he said . the development in pyongyang " raises the question of proliferation of nuclear technology and -lrb- the -rrb- possibility of north korea selling that technology to terrorist groups , " barroso added .
" it 's very important we stand firm and support the united nations sanctions . " a fractions consensus the un text agreed to saturday demands elimination of all north korean programs related to weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles , a ban targeting missiles , tanks , large artillery systems , warships and combat aircraft , and provides for the inspection of cargo to and from the state . it further allows for a travel ban on officials working on such programs and the freezing of funds and economic assets linked to them , as well as slapping an embargo on luxury goods .
it specifically does not include any reference to military action . while the international community has broadly welcomed un sanctions against north korea , the consensus is still fractious . us president george w. bush said the unanimous security council resolution sent a clear message to north korean leader kim jong-il , a statement echoed in london , paris , tokyo and seoul . bildunterschrift : the un security council passed sanctions saturday but signs of the intense diplomatic haggling over the scale and nature of the sanctions were evident even after the text was approved in new york , with china - pyongyang 's closest ally - voicing reservations about provisions for inspecting cargo entering and leaving north korea . " we advocate that the un security council 's action has to show the firm position of the international community , but on the other hand it also should be conducive towards resolving the problems through peaceful dialogue , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told reporters . in contrast , japan , which had pushed for even tougher measures , said it was considering further action of its own to ratchet up the pressure on pyongyang . keeping the community united bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n. korean leader kim jong il wants more atomic tests when asked if the european union would push for firmer measures if north korea failed to respond to the sanctions , he replied : " we believe we have to keep the international community as united as possible . " we are very happy for instance with the tough position taken by china , " barroso said .
" that -lrb- chinese position -rrb- was good because this is also important for iran .
with iran , we are trying to follow the diplomatic route .
so the signal that we give now with north korea can be also important for the iran issue . " russia and china have balked at the type of sanctions against iran that the united states and its eu allies have supported while continuing to keep diplomatic options open . iran has been under growing pressure since missing an aug .

" of course we fully back " the sanctions agreed to in the un security council on saturday , european commission president jose manuel barroso told bbc television during a visit to london . " they are really important for the credibility of the international community because what 's happening in north korea is not only very bad and very dangerous for the region , but for the world , " he said . the development in pyongyang " raises the question of proliferation of nuclear technology and -lrb- the -rrb- possibility of north korea selling that technology to terrorist groups , " barroso added .
" it 's very important we stand firm and support the united nations sanctions . " a fractions consensus the un text agreed to saturday demands elimination of all north korean programs related to weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles , a ban targeting missiles , tanks , large artillery systems , warships and combat aircraft , and provides for the inspection of cargo to and from the state . it further allows for a travel ban on officials working on such programs and the freezing of funds and economic assets linked to them , as well as slapping an embargo on luxury goods .
it specifically does not include any reference to military action . while the international community has broadly welcomed un sanctions against north korea , the consensus is still fractious . us president george w. bush said the unanimous security council resolution sent a clear message to north korean leader kim jong-il , a statement echoed in london , paris , tokyo and seoul . bildunterschrift : the un security council passed sanctions saturday but signs of the intense diplomatic haggling over the scale and nature of the sanctions were evident even after the text was approved in new york , with china - pyongyang 's closest ally - voicing reservations about provisions for inspecting cargo entering and leaving north korea . " we advocate that the un security council 's action has to show the firm position of the international community , but on the other hand it also should be conducive towards resolving the problems through peaceful dialogue , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told reporters . in contrast , japan , which had pushed for even tougher measures , said it was considering further action of its own to ratchet up the pressure on pyongyang . keeping the community united bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : n. korean leader kim jong il wants more atomic tests when asked if the european union would push for firmer measures if north korea failed to respond to the sanctions , he replied : " we believe we have to keep the international community as united as possible . " we are very happy for instance with the tough position taken by china , " barroso said .
" that -lrb- chinese position -rrb- was good because this is also important for iran .
with iran , we are trying to follow the diplomatic route .
so the signal that we give now with north korea can be also important for the iran issue . " russia and china have balked at the type of sanctions against iran that the united states and its eu allies have supported while continuing to keep diplomatic options open . iran has been under growing pressure since missing an aug .

the energy source of the future is cheap and available everywhere on the streets of berlin .
you may have even had to scrape it off your shoes . in berlin , dog poop happens .
literally , all over the place .
according to berlin sanitary officials , 55 tons of doggie mess is generated on the streets of the city every day .
and most of it is left unattended - for other canines ' sniffing pleasure , for children to play hopscotch around , or for senior citizens to hold their passionate diatribes against . the german capital is an extremely dog-friendly city .
dogs attend gallery openings , jazz concerts , sunday brunches and baby showers .
but berlin 's dog owners are mostly of the let-somebody-else-scoop-the-poop persuasion .
it 's part of the laissez-faire attitude that berliners are known for .
one needs to have some sense of history . what 's a little poo here or there in a city that had the iron curtain run through its very heart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is hip and easygoing , but walking the streets poses its own dangers yet anybody who ever walked down wrangelstrasse in berlin 's multiethnic kreuzberg district , or along kastanienallee in the hipster paradise known as prenzlauer berg , is more likely to step into a pile of dog doo than run into somebody who would wish them a nice day . " there are way too many dogs in berlin , " bernd krüger , 65 , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" my recommendation would be to ban dog sales in berlin for five years . " with 150,000 dogs marking berlin as their home - this staggering number roughly corresponds to the combined human population of liechtenstein , monaco , san marino , the marshall islands and nauru - berlin officials have finally realized that germany 's cool and vibrant capital is suffering from a major poop attack . educate the masses , fight the poop that 's why they launched a week-long awareness campaign on oct .

" it 's like tilting at windmills , " said the mayor of berlin 's neukölln district . a green solution but there is still hope .
berlin officials are carefully studying the example of san francisco , in which a pilot project is exploring the feasibility of turning dog poop into biofuel .
pet dung may not make a great gift , but if collected and run through a methane digester - a container in which bacteria break down the feces to create methane - it can make its way directly to a heater , stove or any other appliance powered by natural gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : san francisco may teach berlin a few lessons " we know about the san francisco project , " said bernd müller , a spokesperson for the city 's sanitary services .
" together with scientists from humboldt university , we are currently looking into whether it would be possible and economical to do something like that in berlin . " keeping in mind that energy is going to be one of germany 's main concerns during its six-month presidency of the european union , starting in january 2007 , the importance of such a truly alternative energy source could even catch on in other european countries as well . will there be a backlash ? nobody knows yet what will happen next in berlin 's heroic attempt to clean up its streets .
there is , however , hardly a demonstration in the city that does n't inspire a counter-demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is this world coming to ?
soon we 'll have to start picking after ourselves berlin 's love parade , for example - a dream come true for techno maniacs from all over the world - was deemed too commercial by the city 's grunge chic mafia .
so they organized their own event - the hate parade - to run in parallel with the celebration of polyester jumpsuits and adrenaline rushes . will berlin dog owners comply or will city officials have to resort to more drastic measures - anti-poop commandos with gas masks and anti-chemical weapons ?
will the unruly dog owners become more disciplined or will a countermovement of disgruntled animal lovers announce that dogs need to have their say in the whole matter , too ?
only time will tell . after repeated encounters with the dark force on a jogging track , dennis gebhard , a 23-year-old berlin design student has started to sell a warning sign he devised with the picture of a terrier that reads " phooey , daddy !

the energy source of the future is cheap and available everywhere on the streets of berlin .
you may have even had to scrape it off your shoes . in berlin , dog poop happens .
literally , all over the place .
according to berlin sanitary officials , 55 tons of doggie mess is generated on the streets of the city every day .
and most of it is left unattended - for other canines ' sniffing pleasure , for children to play hopscotch around , or for senior citizens to hold their passionate diatribes against . the german capital is an extremely dog-friendly city .
dogs attend gallery openings , jazz concerts , sunday brunches and baby showers .
but berlin 's dog owners are mostly of the let-somebody-else-scoop-the-poop persuasion .
it 's part of the laissez-faire attitude that berliners are known for .
one needs to have some sense of history . what 's a little poo here or there in a city that had the iron curtain run through its very heart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is hip and easygoing , but walking the streets poses its own dangers yet anybody who ever walked down wrangelstrasse in berlin 's multiethnic kreuzberg district , or along kastanienallee in the hipster paradise known as prenzlauer berg , is more likely to step into a pile of dog doo than run into somebody who would wish them a nice day . " there are way too many dogs in berlin , " bernd krüger , 65 , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" my recommendation would be to ban dog sales in berlin for five years . " with 150,000 dogs marking berlin as their home - this staggering number roughly corresponds to the combined human population of liechtenstein , monaco , san marino , the marshall islands and nauru - berlin officials have finally realized that germany 's cool and vibrant capital is suffering from a major poop attack . educate the masses , fight the poop that 's why they launched a week-long awareness campaign on oct .
16 .
with posters and flyers , the city is hoping to make dog owners a little more respectful of their surroundings , while alerting them to dog waste as a health risk and a source of general annoyance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning up in berlin is not always fun popularizing poop-scooping , however , may turn out to be difficult . " it 's like tilting at windmills , " said the mayor of berlin 's neukölln district . a green solution but there is still hope .
berlin officials are carefully studying the example of san francisco , in which a pilot project is exploring the feasibility of turning dog poop into biofuel .
pet dung may not make a great gift , but if collected and run through a methane digester - a container in which bacteria break down the feces to create methane - it can make its way directly to a heater , stove or any other appliance powered by natural gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : san francisco may teach berlin a few lessons " we know about the san francisco project , " said bernd müller , a spokesperson for the city 's sanitary services .
" together with scientists from humboldt university , we are currently looking into whether it would be possible and economical to do something like that in berlin . " keeping in mind that energy is going to be one of germany 's main concerns during its six-month presidency of the european union , starting in january 2007 , the importance of such a truly alternative energy source could even catch on in other european countries as well . will there be a backlash ? nobody knows yet what will happen next in berlin 's heroic attempt to clean up its streets .
there is , however , hardly a demonstration in the city that does n't inspire a counter-demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is this world coming to ?
soon we 'll have to start picking after ourselves berlin 's love parade , for example - a dream come true for techno maniacs from all over the world - was deemed too commercial by the city 's grunge chic mafia .
so they organized their own event - the hate parade - to run in parallel with the celebration of polyester jumpsuits and adrenaline rushes . will berlin dog owners comply or will city officials have to resort to more drastic measures - anti-poop commandos with gas masks and anti-chemical weapons ?
will the unruly dog owners become more disciplined or will a countermovement of disgruntled animal lovers announce that dogs need to have their say in the whole matter , too ?
only time will tell . after repeated encounters with the dark force on a jogging track , dennis gebhard , a 23-year-old berlin design student has started to sell a warning sign he devised with the picture of a terrier that reads " phooey , daddy !
phooey , mommy ! " " it would n't be bad if my signs were all over the city , " gebhard said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .
so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion .

the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .

the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union . " i disagree very clearly with president bush when he says that turkey must join europe for security policy reasons , " stoiber said .
" i say , bring nicaragua into the us and then we can talk about it . " " take off your headscarves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said that turkey 's eu membership depends on resolving ties to cyprus the conservative leader appealed to the muslims in germany to distance themselves from terror and violence and to integrate into daily german culture .
about 3.5 million muslims live in germany , 2.5 million of whom are turkish . stoiber 's appeal coincided with statements from german politicians with turkish roots who called for muslim women in germany to stop wearing headscarves . " you live here , so take off your headscarves , " parliamentarian ekin deligöz -lrb- green party -rrb- told bild am sonntag . stoiber lashed out at spd at the csu party convention saturday , edmund stoiber accused the social democrats , which make up the governing coalition together with the cdu and csu , of blocking reforms and being disloyal to chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck is party leader for the spd " we could achieve considerably more progress in berlin if the spd did n't put the brakes on so many issues , " said the bavarian premier , mentioning in particular the hartz iv labor market reform , the renewal of corporate tax and the energy policy . he was particularly critical of kurt beck , spd chairman and governor of north rhine- westphalia , saying his small state had much higher debts than the large state of bavaria . " mr. beck should do his homework before setting his sights higher , " said stoiber , referring to beck 's potential candidacy for the chancellorship in 2009 . csu losing public support members of the spd responded defensively to stoiber 's criticism . " we will continue to experience in the future that stoiber is the greatest security risk for the grand coalition , " said florian pronold , deputy state leader for the spd in bavaria .
" with his escape from berlin and his fickleness in the health reform , stoiber himself is responsible for the fact that he and his party have lost significance . " indeed , public support for the csu has dropped under the symbolic 50 percent mark in bavaria , where the conservative catholic party has governed alone since the mid-1960s . in addition , a poll by zdf television published friday showed that only 24 percent of germans believe stoiber and merkel have a good working relationship , while 43 percent see merkel and beck 's working relationship as positive . stoiber , who lost the 2002 general election , has carved out a reputation as being fickle by repeatedly criticizing health reform proposals from the cdu and spd .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .
the study added fire to a debate about the so-called " under-class " sparked by kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . " germany has an increasing problem .
some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .
" there are far too many people in germany who have lost hope that they will advance in society , " he said . parents in poor families used to live by the notion that their " children should have it better , " but that attitude was increasingly disappearing , he said .

volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .
" i prefer talking about ' people with social and integration problems , " ' kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung paper .
" we have to address the problems that these people are confronted with . " some of those problems are likely to be unemployment , a lack of education and poor child-care opportunities . education crucial the issue of a split in society was something that concerned everyone , said chancellor angela merkel on monday .
" but we will not accept it , " she stressed . the chancellor said the central issue was to make sure that children had the same opportunities from the start .

the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 16.10.2006 german soccer referee suspended in anti-semitism incident großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite awareness campaigns , racism 's still a problem for german soccer the berlin soccer association has permanently barred a referee after accusations that he did nothing to prevent fans from chanting anti-semitic slogans at an amateur match . the decision comes after a match on sept .
26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

" there are way too many dogs in berlin , " bernd krüger , 65 , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" my recommendation would be to ban dog sales in berlin for five years . " with 150,000 dogs marking berlin as their home - this staggering number roughly corresponds to the combined human population of liechtenstein , monaco , san marino , the marshall islands and nauru - berlin officials have finally realized that germany 's cool and vibrant capital is suffering from a major poop attack . educate the masses , fight the poop that 's why they launched a week-long awareness campaign on oct .
16 .
with posters and flyers , the city is hoping to make dog owners a little more respectful of their surroundings , while alerting them to dog waste as a health risk and a source of general annoyance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning up in berlin is not always fun popularizing poop-scooping , however , may turn out to be difficult . " it 's like tilting at windmills , " said the mayor of berlin 's neukölln district . a green solution but there is still hope .
berlin officials are carefully studying the example of san francisco , in which a pilot project is exploring the feasibility of turning dog poop into biofuel .
pet dung may not make a great gift , but if collected and run through a methane digester - a container in which bacteria break down the feces to create methane - it can make its way directly to a heater , stove or any other appliance powered by natural gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : san francisco may teach berlin a few lessons " we know about the san francisco project , " said bernd müller , a spokesperson for the city 's sanitary services .
" together with scientists from humboldt university , we are currently looking into whether it would be possible and economical to do something like that in berlin . " keeping in mind that energy is going to be one of germany 's main concerns during its six-month presidency of the european union , starting in january 2007 , the importance of such a truly alternative energy source could even catch on in other european countries as well . will there be a backlash ? nobody knows yet what will happen next in berlin 's heroic attempt to clean up its streets .
there is , however , hardly a demonstration in the city that does n't inspire a counter-demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is this world coming to ?
soon we 'll have to start picking after ourselves berlin 's love parade , for example - a dream come true for techno maniacs from all over the world - was deemed too commercial by the city 's grunge chic mafia .
so they organized their own event - the hate parade - to run in parallel with the celebration of polyester jumpsuits and adrenaline rushes . will berlin dog owners comply or will city officials have to resort to more drastic measures - anti-poop commandos with gas masks and anti-chemical weapons ?
will the unruly dog owners become more disciplined or will a countermovement of disgruntled animal lovers announce that dogs need to have their say in the whole matter , too ?
only time will tell . after repeated encounters with the dark force on a jogging track , dennis gebhard , a 23-year-old berlin design student has started to sell a warning sign he devised with the picture of a terrier that reads " phooey , daddy !
phooey , mommy ! " " it would n't be bad if my signs were all over the city , " gebhard said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .
since the invitation was issued earlier this year , fears have grown of rising russian muscle-flexing . the west also knows that moscow can play a very strong energy card .
the clearest example of this came when russia cut gas to western neighbor ukraine on jan .
1 during a price dispute , with knock-on effects further west . if eu member states , and former soviet satellites , such as poland , the czech republic and baltic nations want the eu to confront putin over human rights , then " most of the big european capitals think it is not necessary to raise internal questions publicly , and not in the name of the eu , but bilaterally , " missiroli said . politkovskaya murder to be raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya 's murder shocked the world there is likely to be more friction when the european commission jose manuel barroso urges putin to ensure that those who murdered journalist anna politkovskaya are prosecuted .
barroso said sunday that he would push for an investigation and added that moscow 's " credibility " was at stake . " we want those who have assassinated mrs. politkovskaya - a great fighter for freedom of expression - we want them to be brought to justice , " barroso said .
" it 's a question of credibility of the russian government ... to show that they are able to bring to justice those who make those hideous crimes . " we have an interest in having good relations with russia , but i believe russia also has an interest in having good relations with the european union , " barroso added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin seeks german help to modernize russian economy russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union . " i disagree very clearly with president bush when he says that turkey must join europe for security policy reasons , " stoiber said .
" i say , bring nicaragua into the us and then we can talk about it . " " take off your headscarves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said that turkey 's eu membership depends on resolving ties to cyprus the conservative leader appealed to the muslims in germany to distance themselves from terror and violence and to integrate into daily german culture .
about 3.5 million muslims live in germany , 2.5 million of whom are turkish . stoiber 's appeal coincided with statements from german politicians with turkish roots who called for muslim women in germany to stop wearing headscarves . " you live here , so take off your headscarves , " parliamentarian ekin deligöz -lrb- green party -rrb- told bild am sonntag . stoiber lashed out at spd at the csu party convention saturday , edmund stoiber accused the social democrats , which make up the governing coalition together with the cdu and csu , of blocking reforms and being disloyal to chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck is party leader for the spd " we could achieve considerably more progress in berlin if the spd did n't put the brakes on so many issues , " said the bavarian premier , mentioning in particular the hartz iv labor market reform , the renewal of corporate tax and the energy policy . he was particularly critical of kurt beck , spd chairman and governor of north rhine- westphalia , saying his small state had much higher debts than the large state of bavaria . " mr. beck should do his homework before setting his sights higher , " said stoiber , referring to beck 's potential candidacy for the chancellorship in 2009 . csu losing public support members of the spd responded defensively to stoiber 's criticism . " we will continue to experience in the future that stoiber is the greatest security risk for the grand coalition , " said florian pronold , deputy state leader for the spd in bavaria .
" with his escape from berlin and his fickleness in the health reform , stoiber himself is responsible for the fact that he and his party have lost significance . " indeed , public support for the csu has dropped under the symbolic 50 percent mark in bavaria , where the conservative catholic party has governed alone since the mid-1960s . in addition , a poll by zdf television published friday showed that only 24 percent of germans believe stoiber and merkel have a good working relationship , while 43 percent see merkel and beck 's working relationship as positive . stoiber , who lost the 2002 general election , has carved out a reputation as being fickle by repeatedly criticizing health reform proposals from the cdu and spd .

that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine river and pan for gold .
with a little luck , they bring slivers of the precious metal home with them . neuenburg , a city on the rhine river , has the mood of a gold rush town on saturdays .
that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine to learn the art of panning for gold . with a little luck , at the end of the day they bring precious metal back home with them . a little known fact : there really is gold in germany 's rhine .
you 're not likely to find coins or goblets , " but one is guaranteed to find at least little flecks of gold , " said hobby gold prospector franz-josef andorf . in neuenburg , andorf teaches a class for locals and tourists interested in gold panning . a golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this gold nugget was found in switzerland " this is a totally thrilling feeling , " said helga maier-garlipp , who is taking her first course with andorf .
she 's lucky : standing at the bank of the rhine , her hand holds several wafer-thin gold flecks . the rhine deposits more gold in neuenburg than in the rest of germany , mayor joachim schuster says with pride .
the precious metal comes from a geological formation in switzerland and gets moved down several rivers to the rhine .
the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .
the class is not meant for professional treasure seekers . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rejuvenating the rhine river a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .

the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .

that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine river and pan for gold .
with a little luck , they bring slivers of the precious metal home with them . neuenburg , a city on the rhine river , has the mood of a gold rush town on saturdays .
that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine to learn the art of panning for gold . with a little luck , at the end of the day they bring precious metal back home with them . a little known fact : there really is gold in germany 's rhine .
you 're not likely to find coins or goblets , " but one is guaranteed to find at least little flecks of gold , " said hobby gold prospector franz-josef andorf . in neuenburg , andorf teaches a class for locals and tourists interested in gold panning . a golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this gold nugget was found in switzerland " this is a totally thrilling feeling , " said helga maier-garlipp , who is taking her first course with andorf .
she 's lucky : standing at the bank of the rhine , her hand holds several wafer-thin gold flecks . the rhine deposits more gold in neuenburg than in the rest of germany , mayor joachim schuster says with pride .
the precious metal comes from a geological formation in switzerland and gets moved down several rivers to the rhine .
the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .

will the unruly dog owners become more disciplined or will a countermovement of disgruntled animal lovers announce that dogs need to have their say in the whole matter , too ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 16.10.2006 berlin 's latest scoop : harnessing the power of dog poop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power to the pooches forget about russian gas , german coal or controversial nuclear power plants .
the energy source of the future is cheap and available everywhere on the streets of berlin .
you may have even had to scrape it off your shoes . in berlin , dog poop happens .
literally , all over the place .
according to berlin sanitary officials , 55 tons of doggie mess is generated on the streets of the city every day .
and most of it is left unattended - for other canines ' sniffing pleasure , for children to play hopscotch around , or for senior citizens to hold their passionate diatribes against . the german capital is an extremely dog-friendly city .
dogs attend gallery openings , jazz concerts , sunday brunches and baby showers .
but berlin 's dog owners are mostly of the let-somebody-else-scoop-the-poop persuasion .
it 's part of the laissez-faire attitude that berliners are known for .
one needs to have some sense of history . what 's a little poo here or there in a city that had the iron curtain run through its very heart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is hip and easygoing , but walking the streets poses its own dangers yet anybody who ever walked down wrangelstrasse in berlin 's multiethnic kreuzberg district , or along kastanienallee in the hipster paradise known as prenzlauer berg , is more likely to step into a pile of dog doo than run into somebody who would wish them a nice day . " there are way too many dogs in berlin , " bernd krüger , 65 , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" my recommendation would be to ban dog sales in berlin for five years . " with 150,000 dogs marking berlin as their home - this staggering number roughly corresponds to the combined human population of liechtenstein , monaco , san marino , the marshall islands and nauru - berlin officials have finally realized that germany 's cool and vibrant capital is suffering from a major poop attack . educate the masses , fight the poop that 's why they launched a week-long awareness campaign on oct .
16 .
with posters and flyers , the city is hoping to make dog owners a little more respectful of their surroundings , while alerting them to dog waste as a health risk and a source of general annoyance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning up in berlin is not always fun popularizing poop-scooping , however , may turn out to be difficult . " it 's like tilting at windmills , " said the mayor of berlin 's neukölln district . a green solution but there is still hope .
berlin officials are carefully studying the example of san francisco , in which a pilot project is exploring the feasibility of turning dog poop into biofuel .
pet dung may not make a great gift , but if collected and run through a methane digester - a container in which bacteria break down the feces to create methane - it can make its way directly to a heater , stove or any other appliance powered by natural gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : san francisco may teach berlin a few lessons " we know about the san francisco project , " said bernd müller , a spokesperson for the city 's sanitary services .
" together with scientists from humboldt university , we are currently looking into whether it would be possible and economical to do something like that in berlin . " keeping in mind that energy is going to be one of germany 's main concerns during its six-month presidency of the european union , starting in january 2007 , the importance of such a truly alternative energy source could even catch on in other european countries as well . will there be a backlash ? nobody knows yet what will happen next in berlin 's heroic attempt to clean up its streets .
there is , however , hardly a demonstration in the city that does n't inspire a counter-demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is this world coming to ?
soon we 'll have to start picking after ourselves berlin 's love parade , for example - a dream come true for techno maniacs from all over the world - was deemed too commercial by the city 's grunge chic mafia .
so they organized their own event - the hate parade - to run in parallel with the celebration of polyester jumpsuits and adrenaline rushes . will berlin dog owners comply or will city officials have to resort to more drastic measures - anti-poop commandos with gas masks and anti-chemical weapons ?
will the unruly dog owners become more disciplined or will a countermovement of disgruntled animal lovers announce that dogs need to have their say in the whole matter , too ?
only time will tell . after repeated encounters with the dark force on a jogging track , dennis gebhard , a 23-year-old berlin design student has started to sell a warning sign he devised with the picture of a terrier that reads " phooey , daddy !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.10.2006 germany concerned about new " under-class " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans feel they 've been left behind german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .
the study added fire to a debate about the so-called " under-class " sparked by kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . " germany has an increasing problem .
some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .
" there are far too many people in germany who have lost hope that they will advance in society , " he said . parents in poor families used to live by the notion that their " children should have it better , " but that attitude was increasingly disappearing , he said .
under-class or no some politicians responded to the study by blaming increasing poverty and a sense of desperation among germans due to the failures of labor market reforms introduced by the previous government under spd chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needy people waiting for food handouts in munich party-colleague stefan hilsberg told the tagesspiegel paper that the policies " deluded people into thinking that anybody could get a job as long as they are both challenged and supported . " as the term " under-class " gained currency over the course of the debate , the fes stressed on monday the study had in no way discussed it .
volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .
" i prefer talking about ' people with social and integration problems , " ' kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung paper .
" we have to address the problems that these people are confronted with . " some of those problems are likely to be unemployment , a lack of education and poor child-care opportunities . education crucial the issue of a split in society was something that concerned everyone , said chancellor angela merkel on monday .
" but we will not accept it , " she stressed . the chancellor said the central issue was to make sure that children had the same opportunities from the start .
a child 's early school career was decisive for its future education and thus for its chances on the labor market , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are the growing class of poor in germany " a large proportion of young people have never had a chance to learn that there are rules in life you have to abide by , " yvonne pekuhn , who works at a job placement center in berlin , told dw-radio . educational policies in germany have gone wrong , she said , and many young people " have never learned to have aims and objectives worth striving for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.10.2006 germany concerned about new " under-class " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans feel they 've been left behind german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .
the study added fire to a debate about the so-called " under-class " sparked by kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . " germany has an increasing problem .
some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .
" there are far too many people in germany who have lost hope that they will advance in society , " he said . parents in poor families used to live by the notion that their " children should have it better , " but that attitude was increasingly disappearing , he said .
under-class or no some politicians responded to the study by blaming increasing poverty and a sense of desperation among germans due to the failures of labor market reforms introduced by the previous government under spd chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needy people waiting for food handouts in munich party-colleague stefan hilsberg told the tagesspiegel paper that the policies " deluded people into thinking that anybody could get a job as long as they are both challenged and supported . " as the term " under-class " gained currency over the course of the debate , the fes stressed on monday the study had in no way discussed it .
volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .
" i prefer talking about ' people with social and integration problems , " ' kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung paper .
" we have to address the problems that these people are confronted with . " some of those problems are likely to be unemployment , a lack of education and poor child-care opportunities . education crucial the issue of a split in society was something that concerned everyone , said chancellor angela merkel on monday .
" but we will not accept it , " she stressed . the chancellor said the central issue was to make sure that children had the same opportunities from the start .
a child 's early school career was decisive for its future education and thus for its chances on the labor market , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are the growing class of poor in germany " a large proportion of young people have never had a chance to learn that there are rules in life you have to abide by , " yvonne pekuhn , who works at a job placement center in berlin , told dw-radio . educational policies in germany have gone wrong , she said , and many young people " have never learned to have aims and objectives worth striving for .

" europe is a community of values , and i say yes to close cooperation , to friendship with turkey but if we want to make the european union an intellectual center , then i say turkey has no place here , " said bavarian governor edmund stoiber saturday at a csu party convention in augsburg . stoiber , who is also the chairman of the csu , the bavarian sister party and coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , contradicted us president george bush on the issue of turkey 's potential accession to the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 16.10.2006 german soccer referee suspended in anti-semitism incident großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite awareness campaigns , racism 's still a problem for german soccer the berlin soccer association has permanently barred a referee after accusations that he did nothing to prevent fans from chanting anti-semitic slogans at an amateur match . the decision comes after a match on sept .
26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

but in berlin , the first pornography film festival is changing that . they 're not exactly the sorts of movies you 'll find down at the local multiplex .
there is " sexual sushi " and " trannyfags , " " bulldogs in the whitehouse " and " naked over the fence . "
but most are showing in mainstream cinemas around berlin this week during a film festival focusing squarely on the erotic . " pornography itself is not a problem , it 's only made into one , " jürgen brüning , a filmmaker and producer and organizer of the first " pornfilmfestival " told dpa news service .
" we want the festival to help get rid of pornography 's filthy image . " not that the festival is exactly kid friendly ; there will be lots of sex on show .
but brüning and other participants are interested in looking at all the different aspects of sex on celluloid , from the hard-core version focusing on a only few body parts all the way to films that have a full narrative arc - it 's just that these do n't fade to black when the physical interaction starts getting hot and heavy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally scheduled for four days , the festival has stretched out to a month " the basic question posed at this festival is : ' what is pornography ? " ' said michael höfner , the festival 's media spokesperson .
" it is different things to different people .
the young urban hipster will have a completely different view of the pornographic than will the catholic bishop or observant muslim .
about 50 percent of the films in the show are simply discussions about sexuality . " broad spectrum while there might be little on offer during the festival 's four days of screenings that will appeal to many catholic bishops , there is a wide palette of movies that cover most of the sexual spectrum . " american stag " documents the development of adult film industry in the united states ; a series called " dutch pearls " features controversial 70s-era films from the netherlands , including a work by paul verhoeven , now a well-known hollywood director .
a collection of movies from japan will strike many from the west as dancing on the outer edges of sexuality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian porn is one of the more exotic servings on offer curator brüning tried to strike a balance of films that would appeal to both straight and gay audiences , as well as those somewhere in between .
he also wanted to screen works that would appeal to both men and women , who often have different views on what is erotic . " most of the pornography aimed at heterosexual men is not very woman-friendly , " said laura meritt , an author , shop owner and self-proclaimed sex activist who is taking part in the festival .
" we want to show that there are different ways to show sex on the screen , because right now , there 's a lot of crap out there . " unexpected success the amount of interest in the festival has surprised its organizers , höfner said .
what started off as a volunteer-run , four-day festival with no budget scheduled to start on oct .
18 was eventually expanded to the entire month of october , as seminars , workshops and additional films around sex and sexuality were added at various venues around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from raunch to erotica - the spectrum is covered individuals well known in the alternative porn industry , such as performance artist annie sprinkle from san francisco or canadian punk porn film director bruce labruce have come for screenings , workshops and performances . according to höfner , there have been no complaints about the festival from parties who feel bringing pornography to the movie theater around the corner is a step too far . " anyway , in a way , pornography has already made it into the mainstream movies , " he said , citing the new film " shortbus " by john cameron mitchell or the british film " intimacy .

but in berlin , the first pornography film festival is changing that . they 're not exactly the sorts of movies you 'll find down at the local multiplex .
there is " sexual sushi " and " trannyfags , " " bulldogs in the whitehouse " and " naked over the fence . "
but most are showing in mainstream cinemas around berlin this week during a film festival focusing squarely on the erotic . " pornography itself is not a problem , it 's only made into one , " jürgen brüning , a filmmaker and producer and organizer of the first " pornfilmfestival " told dpa news service .
" we want the festival to help get rid of pornography 's filthy image . " not that the festival is exactly kid friendly ; there will be lots of sex on show .
but brüning and other participants are interested in looking at all the different aspects of sex on celluloid , from the hard-core version focusing on a only few body parts all the way to films that have a full narrative arc - it 's just that these do n't fade to black when the physical interaction starts getting hot and heavy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally scheduled for four days , the festival has stretched out to a month " the basic question posed at this festival is : ' what is pornography ? " ' said michael höfner , the festival 's media spokesperson .
" it is different things to different people .
the young urban hipster will have a completely different view of the pornographic than will the catholic bishop or observant muslim .
about 50 percent of the films in the show are simply discussions about sexuality . " broad spectrum while there might be little on offer during the festival 's four days of screenings that will appeal to many catholic bishops , there is a wide palette of movies that cover most of the sexual spectrum . " american stag " documents the development of adult film industry in the united states ; a series called " dutch pearls " features controversial 70s-era films from the netherlands , including a work by paul verhoeven , now a well-known hollywood director .
a collection of movies from japan will strike many from the west as dancing on the outer edges of sexuality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian porn is one of the more exotic servings on offer curator brüning tried to strike a balance of films that would appeal to both straight and gay audiences , as well as those somewhere in between .
he also wanted to screen works that would appeal to both men and women , who often have different views on what is erotic . " most of the pornography aimed at heterosexual men is not very woman-friendly , " said laura meritt , an author , shop owner and self-proclaimed sex activist who is taking part in the festival .
" we want to show that there are different ways to show sex on the screen , because right now , there 's a lot of crap out there . " unexpected success the amount of interest in the festival has surprised its organizers , höfner said .
what started off as a volunteer-run , four-day festival with no budget scheduled to start on oct .
18 was eventually expanded to the entire month of october , as seminars , workshops and additional films around sex and sexuality were added at various venues around berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from raunch to erotica - the spectrum is covered individuals well known in the alternative porn industry , such as performance artist annie sprinkle from san francisco or canadian punk porn film director bruce labruce have come for screenings , workshops and performances . according to höfner , there have been no complaints about the festival from parties who feel bringing pornography to the movie theater around the corner is a step too far . " anyway , in a way , pornography has already made it into the mainstream movies , " he said , citing the new film " shortbus " by john cameron mitchell or the british film " intimacy .

" tensions between moscow and tbilisi escalated recently with georgia 's arrest of four russian officers it accused of spying and have remained acute despite georgia 's release of the men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation with georgia concerns the eu moscow ordered the total rupture of ties with its caucasian neighbor and former satellite , spelling trouble for georgian businessmen , and workers in russia . as with the whole raft of issues which the eu 25 will discuss in luxembourg , the draft resolution could yet be altered before or during the meeting . possible clash over georgia ; iran movement unlikely the resolution on iran is less likely to be subject to last-minute tinkering , european diplomats said , with the eu more or less throwing in the towel and handing the dossier over tehran 's nuclear ambitions to the un security council . eu nations now believe that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice " but to throw the issue back to the united nations .
the eu conclusions on iran express " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog , and a security council resolution . on saturday , iran was making friendlier noises , saying that a year-old offer from president mahmoud ahmadinejad for foreign countries to handle its uranium enrichment activities still stands as a way to break the deadlock over its nuclear program . some observers see russia 's increasing global role , notably in the iran and north korea issues , as affording it more leeway over georgia . balancing own needs with russia 's influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian energy power is a major trump card the eu " needs russia on a lot of issues ; north korea , iran , kosovo , energy , " said antonio missiroli , an analyst at the european policy center . and it is not just the european union which is seen as walking a very narrow diplomatic tightrope .
the united states ' decision to approve a un security council resolution on georgia that reflects russian concerns is a concession to moscow aimed at winning cooperation on north korea , a russian newspaper said saturday . russian newspaper kommersant drew a direct link between wrangling at the un over north korea and friday 's resolution on ex-soviet georgia , which urged tbilisi to withdraw troops , perceived as threatening the breakaway province of abkhazia and also extended the mandate of a un mission in georgia . a european diplomat argued that the eu draft resolution on georgia-russia prepared for the eu ministers meeting is " unusually harsh . " it could yet be toned down at the last minute , in line with the eu 's finnish presidency 's wish to make moves towards moscow , several diplomats said . the inter-knitting of issues also leads to the southern serbian province of kosovo .
the russians have already said that independence for kosovo could be used as an argument for the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . energy a sore point for both powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is tiring of the eu 's stance on energy the ghost at the banqueting table will be very much present when russian president vladimir putin is a dinner guest of european leaders during an informal eu summit in lahti , finland on friday .
since the invitation was issued earlier this year , fears have grown of rising russian muscle-flexing . the west also knows that moscow can play a very strong energy card .
the clearest example of this came when russia cut gas to western neighbor ukraine on jan .
1 during a price dispute , with knock-on effects further west . if eu member states , and former soviet satellites , such as poland , the czech republic and baltic nations want the eu to confront putin over human rights , then " most of the big european capitals think it is not necessary to raise internal questions publicly , and not in the name of the eu , but bilaterally , " missiroli said . politkovskaya murder to be raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya 's murder shocked the world there is likely to be more friction when the european commission jose manuel barroso urges putin to ensure that those who murdered journalist anna politkovskaya are prosecuted .
barroso said sunday that he would push for an investigation and added that moscow 's " credibility " was at stake . " we want those who have assassinated mrs. politkovskaya - a great fighter for freedom of expression - we want them to be brought to justice , " barroso said .
" it 's a question of credibility of the russian government ... to show that they are able to bring to justice those who make those hideous crimes .

that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine river and pan for gold .
with a little luck , they bring slivers of the precious metal home with them . neuenburg , a city on the rhine river , has the mood of a gold rush town on saturdays .
that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine to learn the art of panning for gold . with a little luck , at the end of the day they bring precious metal back home with them . a little known fact : there really is gold in germany 's rhine .
you 're not likely to find coins or goblets , " but one is guaranteed to find at least little flecks of gold , " said hobby gold prospector franz-josef andorf . in neuenburg , andorf teaches a class for locals and tourists interested in gold panning . a golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this gold nugget was found in switzerland " this is a totally thrilling feeling , " said helga maier-garlipp , who is taking her first course with andorf .
she 's lucky : standing at the bank of the rhine , her hand holds several wafer-thin gold flecks . the rhine deposits more gold in neuenburg than in the rest of germany , mayor joachim schuster says with pride .
the precious metal comes from a geological formation in switzerland and gets moved down several rivers to the rhine .
the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .

bremen are top dogs ahead of bayern munich and schalke . hosts nuremberg were left shaking their heads on sunday after a poor decision by referee markus merk helped bielefeld earn a 1-all draw .
jörg böhme put the guests up 1-nil from the penalty spot in the 25th minute , after bielefeld striker artur wichniarek went down in the box .
video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .
the draw dropped nuremberg to sixth place in the table . sunday 's other match between hosts cottbus and dortmund got off to a furious start with both sides scoring in the first three minutes .
dortmund then took command on goals by markus brzenska and alexander frei .
cottbus got one back on a late penalty , but that was little more than window dressing .

video replays showed little evidence of contact between wichniarek and nuremberg keeper raphael schäfer . nuremberg knotted things up a goal by jan polak in the 39th minute but could n't decide the match in their favor . " you have to want to give a penalty like that - otherwise you just do n't award it , " said nuremberg coach hans meyer . upon viewing replays merk agreed he 'd made a mistake .

it was a joy to watch the team over certain periods . " but last season 's champions still trail bremen on goal-difference in the standings as both have 13 points along with schalke .

corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .
the latest replica , an electric smart car set enter the market soon , has stirred up legal controversy in europe . last month , 13 million illegal videos and cds were destroyed in china as a symbolic rejection of copyright violation .
but now it seems that copying has been taken to the next level . a duplicate version of the smart fortwo has been produced by the chinese company cmec in the city of suzhou and has already appeared in hungary and great britain .
starting in 2007 , it is to be sold for 4,200 euros -lrb- $ 5,250 -rrb- under the name city smart . " when we designed the car we were aware that we might be opening ourselves up to legal action , " said jerry chen , sales manager for cmec , which is usually involved in importing and exporting machine tools .
" that 's why we 've imitated the outside but concentrated on making the interior look different . " not for the freeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirating cds and dvds has been common in china the major difference , however , is not the car 's appearance but its engine .
it has an electric motor that can only propel the vehicle up to 55 kilometers per hour -lrb- 34 miles per hour -rrb- , hence the name city smart . the standard petrol-powered smart fortwo reaches a top speed of 135 kilometers per hour , according to germany 's autobild magazine . " we 've had electric cars in china for the last 10 years , " chen said .
" there 's nothing special about the technology any more .
it 's mainly used for small vehicles like on golf courses , but you can use it in bigger vehicles if you improve the motor . " the chinese smart has seven generators instead of just four , he said . legal battle begins german smart car manufacturer daimlerchrysler is trying to stop cmec from selling the copycat vehicle and has demanded that its external appearance be changed . chen said that alterations have already been made to the front end and trunk .
he added that " the entire impression is now very different , " though photos that have popped up in recent weeks on internet forums and smart-fan sites reveal that the chinese city smart is practically identical to its european twin . whether or not cmec 's electric smart will be released on the broader european market will depend on whether or not they are deemed legal .
daimlerchrysler 's lawyers are currently looking into what legal steps can be taken .
daimlerchrysler plans to introduce its own smart fortwo successor in march 2007 .

the energy source of the future is cheap and available everywhere on the streets of berlin .
you may have even had to scrape it off your shoes . in berlin , dog poop happens .
literally , all over the place .
according to berlin sanitary officials , 55 tons of doggie mess is generated on the streets of the city every day .
and most of it is left unattended - for other canines ' sniffing pleasure , for children to play hopscotch around , or for senior citizens to hold their passionate diatribes against . the german capital is an extremely dog-friendly city .
dogs attend gallery openings , jazz concerts , sunday brunches and baby showers .
but berlin 's dog owners are mostly of the let-somebody-else-scoop-the-poop persuasion .
it 's part of the laissez-faire attitude that berliners are known for .
one needs to have some sense of history . what 's a little poo here or there in a city that had the iron curtain run through its very heart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is hip and easygoing , but walking the streets poses its own dangers yet anybody who ever walked down wrangelstrasse in berlin 's multiethnic kreuzberg district , or along kastanienallee in the hipster paradise known as prenzlauer berg , is more likely to step into a pile of dog doo than run into somebody who would wish them a nice day . " there are way too many dogs in berlin , " bernd krüger , 65 , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" my recommendation would be to ban dog sales in berlin for five years . " with 150,000 dogs marking berlin as their home - this staggering number roughly corresponds to the combined human population of liechtenstein , monaco , san marino , the marshall islands and nauru - berlin officials have finally realized that germany 's cool and vibrant capital is suffering from a major poop attack . educate the masses , fight the poop that 's why they launched a week-long awareness campaign on oct .

corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .
the latest replica , an electric smart car set enter the market soon , has stirred up legal controversy in europe . last month , 13 million illegal videos and cds were destroyed in china as a symbolic rejection of copyright violation .
but now it seems that copying has been taken to the next level . a duplicate version of the smart fortwo has been produced by the chinese company cmec in the city of suzhou and has already appeared in hungary and great britain .
starting in 2007 , it is to be sold for 4,200 euros -lrb- $ 5,250 -rrb- under the name city smart . " when we designed the car we were aware that we might be opening ourselves up to legal action , " said jerry chen , sales manager for cmec , which is usually involved in importing and exporting machine tools .
" that 's why we 've imitated the outside but concentrated on making the interior look different . " not for the freeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirating cds and dvds has been common in china the major difference , however , is not the car 's appearance but its engine .
it has an electric motor that can only propel the vehicle up to 55 kilometers per hour -lrb- 34 miles per hour -rrb- , hence the name city smart . the standard petrol-powered smart fortwo reaches a top speed of 135 kilometers per hour , according to germany 's autobild magazine . " we 've had electric cars in china for the last 10 years , " chen said .
" there 's nothing special about the technology any more .
it 's mainly used for small vehicles like on golf courses , but you can use it in bigger vehicles if you improve the motor . " the chinese smart has seven generators instead of just four , he said . legal battle begins german smart car manufacturer daimlerchrysler is trying to stop cmec from selling the copycat vehicle and has demanded that its external appearance be changed . chen said that alterations have already been made to the front end and trunk .
he added that " the entire impression is now very different , " though photos that have popped up in recent weeks on internet forums and smart-fan sites reveal that the chinese city smart is practically identical to its european twin . whether or not cmec 's electric smart will be released on the broader european market will depend on whether or not they are deemed legal .
daimlerchrysler 's lawyers are currently looking into what legal steps can be taken .
daimlerchrysler plans to introduce its own smart fortwo successor in march 2007 .
after heavy losses recently , the smart car division hopes for a financial recovery with the more comfortable two-seater . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tiny smart car to challenge giants in us market daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 16.10.2006 berlin 's latest scoop : harnessing the power of dog poop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power to the pooches forget about russian gas , german coal or controversial nuclear power plants .
the energy source of the future is cheap and available everywhere on the streets of berlin .
you may have even had to scrape it off your shoes . in berlin , dog poop happens .
literally , all over the place .
according to berlin sanitary officials , 55 tons of doggie mess is generated on the streets of the city every day .
and most of it is left unattended - for other canines ' sniffing pleasure , for children to play hopscotch around , or for senior citizens to hold their passionate diatribes against . the german capital is an extremely dog-friendly city .
dogs attend gallery openings , jazz concerts , sunday brunches and baby showers .
but berlin 's dog owners are mostly of the let-somebody-else-scoop-the-poop persuasion .
it 's part of the laissez-faire attitude that berliners are known for .
one needs to have some sense of history . what 's a little poo here or there in a city that had the iron curtain run through its very heart ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is hip and easygoing , but walking the streets poses its own dangers yet anybody who ever walked down wrangelstrasse in berlin 's multiethnic kreuzberg district , or along kastanienallee in the hipster paradise known as prenzlauer berg , is more likely to step into a pile of dog doo than run into somebody who would wish them a nice day . " there are way too many dogs in berlin , " bernd krüger , 65 , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" my recommendation would be to ban dog sales in berlin for five years . " with 150,000 dogs marking berlin as their home - this staggering number roughly corresponds to the combined human population of liechtenstein , monaco , san marino , the marshall islands and nauru - berlin officials have finally realized that germany 's cool and vibrant capital is suffering from a major poop attack . educate the masses , fight the poop that 's why they launched a week-long awareness campaign on oct .
16 .
with posters and flyers , the city is hoping to make dog owners a little more respectful of their surroundings , while alerting them to dog waste as a health risk and a source of general annoyance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning up in berlin is not always fun popularizing poop-scooping , however , may turn out to be difficult . " it 's like tilting at windmills , " said the mayor of berlin 's neukölln district . a green solution but there is still hope .
berlin officials are carefully studying the example of san francisco , in which a pilot project is exploring the feasibility of turning dog poop into biofuel .
pet dung may not make a great gift , but if collected and run through a methane digester - a container in which bacteria break down the feces to create methane - it can make its way directly to a heater , stove or any other appliance powered by natural gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : san francisco may teach berlin a few lessons " we know about the san francisco project , " said bernd müller , a spokesperson for the city 's sanitary services .
" together with scientists from humboldt university , we are currently looking into whether it would be possible and economical to do something like that in berlin . " keeping in mind that energy is going to be one of germany 's main concerns during its six-month presidency of the european union , starting in january 2007 , the importance of such a truly alternative energy source could even catch on in other european countries as well . will there be a backlash ? nobody knows yet what will happen next in berlin 's heroic attempt to clean up its streets .
there is , however , hardly a demonstration in the city that does n't inspire a counter-demonstration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is this world coming to ?
soon we 'll have to start picking after ourselves berlin 's love parade , for example - a dream come true for techno maniacs from all over the world - was deemed too commercial by the city 's grunge chic mafia .
so they organized their own event - the hate parade - to run in parallel with the celebration of polyester jumpsuits and adrenaline rushes . will berlin dog owners comply or will city officials have to resort to more drastic measures - anti-poop commandos with gas masks and anti-chemical weapons ?
will the unruly dog owners become more disciplined or will a countermovement of disgruntled animal lovers announce that dogs need to have their say in the whole matter , too ?
only time will tell . after repeated encounters with the dark force on a jogging track , dennis gebhard , a 23-year-old berlin design student has started to sell a warning sign he devised with the picture of a terrier that reads " phooey , daddy !
phooey , mommy ! " " it would n't be bad if my signs were all over the city , " gebhard said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .

the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .

at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state . commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation -lrb- fes -rrb- - which is closely linked to the social democratic party - the study entitled " society in the process of reform " was carried out by the tns infratest research institute . researchers queried around 3,000 eligible voters early this year about their attitudes toward social justice , ambition and performance , solidarity and individual responsibility and grouped them into nine different types .
the result of the as-yet unpublished report was that 8 percent of germans - or 6.5 million - saw themselves as having been completely ostracized , or " left behind , " in society , according to reports of the study 's contents . one in five people in eastern germany and one in 20 people in western germany were said to belong to the growing group of those " left-behind , " who had little education or income , limited occupational mobility and minimal ambitions to advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless person in munich begs for money the foundation said the study reflected a society divided into three tiers .
people in the upper third of society had clear opportunities and perspectives in germany .
the middle third felt insecure , but , depending on the options open to them , had either a " willing " or " skeptical " attitude toward changes in society . the group in the " bottom third " of society felt " increasingly uncomfortable with … the risk of social and political isolation , " and had the sense that the state had abandoned them , according to the fes .

some call it an ' underclass problem , " ' he said in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung last week .

volker kauder , a leading christian democrat , singled out the term for scorn . " the term stigmatizes people and prevents the possibility of being able to reach out to them , " he said .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .

the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .

26 at which a local berlin club with a number of jewish players - tus makkabi - quit in the middle of the game , claiming fans of the home side were subjecting them to racist abuse .
the referee , klaus brüning , denied hearing the taunts and handed out a red card to one of makkabi 's players , causing the entire team to leave the field in the 78th minute . brüning 's decisions have cost him his job .
the berlin soccer association -lrb- dfv -rrb- has excluded him from its ranks , meaning that he will no longer be eligible to officiate matches . explaining the ruling , dfv public relations spokesman frank schlüter said the organization had found that brüning failed to ensure that the match was played under safe conditions .
" regardless of whether the claims were true , the referee has a responsibility to investigate , " schlüter said . the dfv also handed down a number of punishments to makkabi 's opponents , vsg altglienicke .
fans will be barred from the next two home matches , players and coaches will have to attend seminars aimed at preventing racism , and the club has to provide five minders to monitor fan behavior through the end of the 2007-8 season . makkabi reviewing decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alemannia aachen received a record fine for racist abuse from fans the sporting manager for makkabi 's soccer division , claudio offenberg , said the club would review the reasoning behind the dfv 's decision before deciding if it should push for further sanctions against altglienicke . offenberg said the club is targeted with anti-semitic abuse by opposing fans and players " with relative frequency " and said he did n't feel other clubs were doing enough to address the issue . schlüter said the dfv felt the punishments were " hard enough for a small club , " which will be required to pay 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,250 -rrb- for the anti-racism seminars . officials at altglienicke are currently waiting to review the dfv 's decision in written form before deciding whether to accept the punishment or appeal . other racist incidents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national gerald asamoah was the target of racist taunts in rostock racism among german football fans remains a problem at all levels .
the sport 's national governing body , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , has handed out some record punishments this season .
earlier this month , the dfb fined first-division aachen and mönchengladbach 50,000 and 19,000 euros -lrb- $ 62,500 and $ 24,000 -rrb- respectively for racist fan abuse when those two teams met . second-division eastern german club hansa rostock had to cough up 20,000 euros after supporters berated ghana-born german national gerald asamoah during a german cup match with rostock 's amateur team in september . but many observers worry that it will be hard to prevent racism at lower-division matches , which take place far from the public spotlight - and the scrutiny of the associations charged with maintaining minimum standards of fair play . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitic slurs at soccer game spur action against racism in the professional soccer stadiums , racism has gone underground but is on the rise in the local leagues and in eastern germany , according to a recent study .

that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine river and pan for gold .
with a little luck , they bring slivers of the precious metal home with them . neuenburg , a city on the rhine river , has the mood of a gold rush town on saturdays .
that 's when amateur treasure seekers wade into the rhine to learn the art of panning for gold . with a little luck , at the end of the day they bring precious metal back home with them . a little known fact : there really is gold in germany 's rhine .
you 're not likely to find coins or goblets , " but one is guaranteed to find at least little flecks of gold , " said hobby gold prospector franz-josef andorf . in neuenburg , andorf teaches a class for locals and tourists interested in gold panning . a golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this gold nugget was found in switzerland " this is a totally thrilling feeling , " said helga maier-garlipp , who is taking her first course with andorf .
she 's lucky : standing at the bank of the rhine , her hand holds several wafer-thin gold flecks . the rhine deposits more gold in neuenburg than in the rest of germany , mayor joachim schuster says with pride .
the precious metal comes from a geological formation in switzerland and gets moved down several rivers to the rhine .
the quantity of gold is small , there 's nowhere near enough to cause a gold rush like in california or australia . yet what 's there has been keeping people hunting for hundreds of years . gold flecks can be found in river detritus that gets agitated and washed up during high water , andorf said .
to search for the gold , his students dig up the hardened riverbed with picks and shovels .
andorf 's students put the material through a wash pan .
the sand gets washed out , leaving hard minerals and gold in the bottom of the container . all that glitters is not gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small flecks of gold found in the rhine river the motion needed for panning the gold is not so easy and requires practice , andorf said .
also , novices often get tricked by pyrite .
the so-called fool 's gold glitters in the pan and sometimes causes premature celebrations . " when you ca n't split the piece with your thumbnail , then it is really gold , " andorf told his students .
the gold slivers they find in the rhine are , for the most part , smaller than a millimeter . andorf 's course is organized as a continuing education program for people who want to pursue gold panning as a hobby .
the class is not meant for professional treasure seekers . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : rejuvenating the rhine river a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .

sea containers - the passenger and freight transport firm - is likely to take the step on monday after deciding it can not repay its $ 630m -lrb- £ 339m -rrb- debt .
the move will give it legal protection from its creditors and breathing space to restructure its finances .
the firm said any such move would have no impact on gner , which runs intercity trains along the east coast main line .
but rail unions have expressed fears that it could lead to job losses .
' business as usual ' gner has struggled since it was given a 10-year extension to its franchise last year to operate trains between london and edinburgh .
passenger revenues for the first 14 months of its franchise were £ 32m lower than anticipated , hit by the impact of the 7 july attacks , rising electricity prices and growing competition .
sea containers has made it clear that it will have no impact on the operation of the gner franchise department of transport earlier this year gner lost a legal battle to prevent rivals grand central and hull trains company from operating services linking east coast towns with london .
gner has broached the revenue shortfall with the government but sea containers stressed that its own financial difficulties would have no impact on these discussions or on the franchise itself .
" it is completely separate and will absolutely not have any impact on gner , " a company spokeswoman said .
" trains and operations will continue to function as normal . "
debt dues the sunday times reported that the department of transport had hired law firm clifford chance to advise on the potential legal issues arising out of such a move by sea containers .
the department of transport said it could not comment on this but added that the issue was a " commercial matter " for sea containers .
" sea containers has made it clear that it will have no impact on the operation of the gner franchise , " a spokesman said .
sea containers has cut its debts in half over the past year but following a meeting with creditors in new york , it is almost certain to opt for bankruptcy protection as a means of reorganising its borrowing .

to help solve the problem police and other consumer organisations have launched their second national identity fraud prevention week .
a bin-raiding test in london found nearly half of the 120 tested homes had thrown away enough information for their identity to be stolen .
the government has estimated that id fraud cost the uk £ 1.7bn last year .
according to cifas , the uk 's fraud prevention service , identity theft has risen more than five-fold from 20,000 cases in 1999 to 137,000 in 2005 .
but experts have suggested that the true figure of id fraud cases is in fact far higher .
wandsworth dustbins how to avoid id theft do not use your mother 's maiden name or place of birth as a security password check your credit record annually if you move , make sure you let your bank know shred or rip-up post before throwing it in the bin never use the same password for all your accounts do not carry address details in your wallet source : which ?
q & a : protecting your identity how to reclaim your identity ' i had my identity stolen ' the bin-raiding experiment - commissioned by paper shredder manufacturer fellowes and backed by the metropolitan police , crimestoppers , uk fraud prevention service cifas and several credit rating agencies - was carried out in four streets in the london borough of wandsworth .
researchers , helped by the council , rifled through the rubbish and re-cycling boxes thrown out by the residents .
the results gave a hint at the ease with which criminals might be able to steal valuable data .
credit and debit card numbers had been thrown away in their rubbish by 30 % of the 120 homes , the researchers found .
documents containing bank account numbers and sort codes had been thrown away by 46 % of those whose rubbish was investigated .
and 73 % had thrown out paper showing their exact signature on a credit or debit card , the report said .
such a small sample is not representative , either geographically or demographically , of the wider uk population .
but the government believes this sort of carelessness is one reason why identity fraud has been a growing problem in the last few years .
fast growing crime " identity fraud is costing the uk billions of pounds a year , and is one of britain 's fastest growing crimes , " said nigel evans , mp for ribble valley and chair of the all party group on identity fraud .
" yet people are still not doing enough to protect themselves . "
throwing away your personal details is as good as advertising them in the local paper . "
nigel evans mp send us your experiences " throwing away your personal details is as good as advertising them in the local paper .
we are making it far too easy for the identity thieves , " he added .
professor martin gill , an expert on id fraud from the university of leicester , told the bbc 's five live that shredding bills was not enough .
he said he had spoken to offenders who took such things as bank statements and utility bills during burglaries .
" bag snatches and pick-pockets is another way they get information , so you 've really got to be careful across the board .
" computing and the internet has its own little dangers , so we 've got to make sure we pay attention there .
and here is the problem with this .
there are lots of ways offenders get information - and we really need to be aware of them and not make it easy . "
criminal call campaigners have been calling for id theft to be made a criminal offence in the uk , at present only using a stolen identity to obtain goods and services by deception is outlawed .
in the usa , which faced an upsurge in id theft earlier than the uk , stealing someone 's identity is now an jailable offence .
one reason for the stiff penalties is that in the us the problem of id theft can be exacerbated by the use of social security numbers .
the wide use of social security numbers can mean that an individual 's identity can be thoroughly compromised by criminals , analysts said .
and in some extreme cases , according to cifas , victims have had to declare themselves legally dead to resolve the situation , a phenomena known as ' pseudocide ' .

bermuda-based passenger and freight transport firm sea containers made the move on monday , after deciding it could not repay its $ 630m -lrb- £ 339m -rrb- debts .
the move will give it protection from legal action by creditors and breathing space to restructure its finances .
there will be no impact on gner , which will continue running intercity trains along the east coast main line .
we continue with our business strategy and for our key operating units it will be ' business as usual ' sea containers ceo bob mackenzie sea containers and two subsidiaries , sea containers services and sea containers caribbean , filed for protection in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware .
" the prime reason for seeking protection is to prevent any individual creditor from taking action on its own , which would be against the interests of sea containers and the majority of creditors , " said sea containers chief executive bob mackenzie .
" we continue with our business strategy and for our key operating units it will be ' business as usual ' . "
' uncertain time ' mr mackenzie added that " operating subsidiaries such as gner , the uk rail operator ... will continue their day-to-day operations " .
after the announcement , rail users group passenger focus told the bbc : " we hope that this uncertain time does not affect the current good performance of gner on the route . "
they said they hoped the department for transport -lrb- dft -rrb- would work with gner to ensure the long-term viability of the east coast service .
should gner not be able to keep operating on the route , the dft would take over running the services as an " operator of last resort " to ensure passenger trains continue .
franchise extension sea containers said it had kept the uk department for transport " abreast of developments " and that gner was not in breach of any of its franchise commitments .
it said that gner 's finances had been " ring-fenced " from those of sea containers .
gner has struggled since it was given a 10-year extension to its franchise last year to operate trains between london and edinburgh .
gner services connect london to north-east england and scotland passenger revenues for the first 14 months of its franchise were £ 32m lower than anticipated , hit by the impact of the 7 july attacks , rising electricity prices and growing competition .
in the summer gner lost a court bid to prevent grand central running services from sunderland to london this winter on the east coast main line .
sea containers , suspended from the new york stock exchange earlier this month , has cut its debts in half over the past year .
however on sunday the ferry and freight company warned it was unlikely to be able to pay a £ 62m which became due on monday morning .
chapter 11 is a us legal device that allows a bankrupt business to carry on operating under the existing management and prevents creditors from forcing it into liquidation .

bermuda-based passenger and freight transport firm sea containers made the move on monday , after deciding it could not repay its $ 630m -lrb- £ 339m -rrb- debts .
the move will give it protection from legal action by creditors and breathing space to restructure its finances .
there will be no impact on gner , which will continue running intercity trains along the east coast main line .
we continue with our business strategy and for our key operating units it will be ' business as usual ' sea containers ceo bob mackenzie sea containers and two subsidiaries , sea containers services and sea containers caribbean , filed for protection in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware .
" the prime reason for seeking protection is to prevent any individual creditor from taking action on its own , which would be against the interests of sea containers and the majority of creditors , " said sea containers chief executive bob mackenzie .
" we continue with our business strategy and for our key operating units it will be ' business as usual ' . "
' uncertain time ' mr mackenzie added that " operating subsidiaries such as gner , the uk rail operator ... will continue their day-to-day operations " .
after the announcement , rail users group passenger focus told the bbc : " we hope that this uncertain time does not affect the current good performance of gner on the route . "
they said they hoped the department for transport -lrb- dft -rrb- would work with gner to ensure the long-term viability of the east coast service .
should gner not be able to keep operating on the route , the dft would take over running the services as an " operator of last resort " to ensure passenger trains continue .
franchise extension sea containers said it had kept the uk department for transport " abreast of developments " and that gner was not in breach of any of its franchise commitments .
it said that gner 's finances had been " ring-fenced " from those of sea containers .
gner has struggled since it was given a 10-year extension to its franchise last year to operate trains between london and edinburgh .
gner services connect london to north-east england and scotland passenger revenues for the first 14 months of its franchise were £ 32m lower than anticipated , hit by the impact of the 7 july attacks , rising electricity prices and growing competition .
in the summer gner lost a court bid to prevent grand central running services from sunderland to london this winter on the east coast main line .
sea containers , suspended from the new york stock exchange earlier this month , has cut its debts in half over the past year .
however on sunday the ferry and freight company warned it was unlikely to be able to pay a £ 62m which became due on monday morning .
chapter 11 is a us legal device that allows a bankrupt business to carry on operating under the existing management and prevents creditors from forcing it into liquidation .

the bureau will be staffed by reuters media correspondent adam pasick who will report on the lives and business dealings of second life 's residents .
an avatar resembling mr pasick , called adam reuters in the game , has been created to act as a virtual reporter in the world for the news agency .
second life has almost one million members and 400,000 of those are regular visitors to the online world .
making headlines while many online virtual worlds are games that encourage users to live out a fantasy existence as a warrior or wizard , second life is intended to be a more playful version of the real world .
second lifers can alter their appearance to look like animals or robots and buy outlandish homes , such as giant shoes , to live in .
the virtual world has been in the news a lot recently as real world firms establish in-game presences .
car maker toyota is planning to offer a virtual version of its scion xb van to second lifers .
bbc radio one has rented an island in the game that will be used to stage concerts .
mr pasick said he would act like any other correspondent and chase up news stories in second life .
" as strange as it might seem , it 's not that different from being a reporter in the real world , " he said .
" once you get used to it - it becomes very much like the job i have been doing for years . "
he is also planning to explore issues that the growth of online worlds have exposed , such as the intersection between real and virtual economies .
the currency in second life , known as linden dollars , can be swapped for real money and many regular players make a significant income from their game transactions .
on an average day the second life economy involves the turnover of goods and services worth more than 400,000 dollars .
news stories will be filed to a blog and to a portable device that reuters will make available to second life avatars so they can stay up to date with the latest virtual and real world news .

the news comes just hours after police recommended that he face charges for rape and wire-tapping .
a number of deputies had threatened to walk out of the knesset if he attended .
mr katsav denies claims that he forced two female employees to have sex with him , along with all other allegations which police have been investigating .
a formal decision on whether to prosecute him will be made by the attorney general menachem mazuz .
we have no doubt of his innocence , we know he is being framed and he is being blamed of things that did not happen lior katsav , president 's brother earlier , israel 's education minister yuli tamir told the bbc that she felt mr katsav would be wrong to attend the opening of the knesset 's winter session : " he should avoid the embarrassment both to himself and to the institute of the presidency .
he has done enough to embarrass us all and that is the right time for him , if not to resign then , to decide not to participate in public meetings anymore . "
mr katsav 's brother , lior , told israel army radio that the president had decided to stay away to protect the dignity of the knesset .
" we have no doubt of his innocence .
we know he is being framed and he is being blamed of things that did not happen , " lior katsav added .
impeachment threat the post of president , to which mr katsav was elected for a seven-year term in 2000 , is largely ceremonial .
the 61-year-old father-of-five has rejected calls that he quit , but the bbc 's richard miron in jerusalem says that could change if he is indicted .
as president , mr katsav is immune from prosecution , should the attorney general decide to prosecute him .
however , parliamentarians are likely to seek to impeach him , lifting that immunity , if they feel that he has acted inappropriately .
there is sufficient evidence indicating that in several cases ... the president carried out acts of rape , forced sexual acts , sexual acts without consent and sexual harassment israeli police statement the allegations against the president have shaken the israeli political establishment , causing dismay and disillusionment among an already jaded israeli public , our correspondent says .
there is a widespread sense of dissatisfaction , our correspondent says , following a swathe of scandals and the performance of israel 's leaders during the recent war in lebanon .
although in the past a previous president and several prime ministers were embroiled in financial scandals and a former defence minister was convicted of sexual harassment , the charges mr katsav faces would be the most serious ever to be brought against a serving israeli politician .
presidential pardons israeli media reports have said that the case against mr katsav is based on complaints from up to 10 women .
police searched the president 's home in august after allegations of sexual harassment emerged , and have questioned him repeatedly and seized documents during the investigation .
following that investigation police issued a statement on sunday saying : " there is sufficient evidence indicating that in several cases ... the president carried out acts of rape , forced sexual acts , sexual acts without consent and sexual harassment . "
mr katsav has said he is the victim of a " public lynching without trial or investigation " .
mr katsav is a veteran member of the right-wing likud party , serving as transport minister in the late 1980s and in 1996 as minister of tourism and deputy prime minister .

the news comes just hours after police recommended that he face charges for rape and wire-tapping .
a number of deputies had threatened to walk out of the knesset if he attended .
mr katsav denies claims that he forced two female employees to have sex with him , along with all other allegations which police have been investigating .
a formal decision on whether to prosecute him will be made by the attorney general menachem mazuz .
we have no doubt of his innocence , we know he is being framed and he is being blamed of things that did not happen lior katsav , president 's brother earlier , israel 's education minister yuli tamir told the bbc that she felt mr katsav would be wrong to attend the opening of the knesset 's winter session : " he should avoid the embarrassment both to himself and to the institute of the presidency .
he has done enough to embarrass us all and that is the right time for him , if not to resign then , to decide not to participate in public meetings anymore . "
mr katsav 's brother , lior , told israel army radio that the president had decided to stay away to protect the dignity of the knesset .
" we have no doubt of his innocence .
we know he is being framed and he is being blamed of things that did not happen , " lior katsav added .
impeachment threat the post of president , to which mr katsav was elected for a seven-year term in 2000 , is largely ceremonial .
the 61-year-old father-of-five has rejected calls that he quit , but the bbc 's richard miron in jerusalem says that could change if he is indicted .
as president , mr katsav is immune from prosecution , should the attorney general decide to prosecute him .
however , parliamentarians are likely to seek to impeach him , lifting that immunity , if they feel that he has acted inappropriately .
there is sufficient evidence indicating that in several cases ... the president carried out acts of rape , forced sexual acts , sexual acts without consent and sexual harassment israeli police statement the allegations against the president have shaken the israeli political establishment , causing dismay and disillusionment among an already jaded israeli public , our correspondent says .
there is a widespread sense of dissatisfaction , our correspondent says , following a swathe of scandals and the performance of israel 's leaders during the recent war in lebanon .
although in the past a previous president and several prime ministers were embroiled in financial scandals and a former defence minister was convicted of sexual harassment , the charges mr katsav faces would be the most serious ever to be brought against a serving israeli politician .
presidential pardons israeli media reports have said that the case against mr katsav is based on complaints from up to 10 women .
police searched the president 's home in august after allegations of sexual harassment emerged , and have questioned him repeatedly and seized documents during the investigation .
following that investigation police issued a statement on sunday saying : " there is sufficient evidence indicating that in several cases ... the president carried out acts of rape , forced sexual acts , sexual acts without consent and sexual harassment . "
mr katsav has said he is the victim of a " public lynching without trial or investigation " .

alliance & leicester said that the extra costs relating to the process of getting divorced can erode finances .
a divorcee owes an average of about £ 5,000 , excluding mortgages , equivalent to 28 % of their annual salary .
married couples owe a little more on average , about £ 5,250 , but this equates to 15.9 % of their combined salary .
' relationship breakdown ' " splitting up clearly gives rise to a lot of costs , including setting up a new home , " chris rhodes , managing director of alliance & leicester retail banking , said .
" this is reflected in the fact that the recently separated have the highest overall level of debt .
" however , over the years , divorced people 's finances do not seem to improve - showing how long-lived the effects of relationship breakdown can be , " he added .
the research found that divorcees have lower than average levels of savings and are more likely to live in social housing rather than own property .
the alliance & leicester said that single people tend to owe the most , about £ 5,300 on average , but they are usually younger than divorcees so have more time to pay off their debts .
in addition , the bulk of single people 's debt usually results from low-cost student loans , as opposed to more expensive credit card and loan debt .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- q & a : nandrolone home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health medical notes science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 16 october 2006 , 09:15 gmt 10:15 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : nandrolone nandrolone is a performance-enhancing drug what is nandrolone , and how is it detected in the human body ?
what is nandrolone ?
nandrolone is a type of anabolic steroid .
it occurs naturally in the body in very tiny quantities , but can also be made synthetically .
it has been banned from sports because of its muscle-boosting abilities .
a number of high-profile sportsmen and women have tested positive for the drug , including linford christie , but have later been cleared of wrongdoing .
are tests for nandrolone conclusive ?
the by-products of nandrolone can be detected in urine .
if they are found at a concentration greater than two nanograms per millilitre -lrb- deemed to be the upper limit at which the substance can occur naturally in the body -rrb- , the sportsperson may be banned .
but while a test can determine the presence of nandrolone the body , it does not necessarily prove wrongdoing .
more nandrolone could be present if the subject has eaten large quantities of meat contaminated with the substance .
certain animals may create a bigger risk , particularly horse and boar - and athletes are warned to avoid eating offal from these animals .
it is also possible that dietary supplements which appear perfectly legal can be broken down by the body to produce the same substances created when nandrolone is broken down .
again , athletes are warned not to believe everything they read on the labels of these supplements .
a uk sport report on nandrolone said : " we recommend that the sports community should be reminded they must maintain a high level of awareness of the possible hazards of using some nutritional supplements and herbal preparations " .
the other source of nandrolone metabolites is other types of steroid - but these are also banned by world sport bodies .
why do sportspeople take substances like nandrolone ?
anabolic steroids can improve the body 's capacity to train and compete at the highest level .
they reduce the fatigue associated with training , and the time required to recover after physical exertion .
they also promote the development of muscle tissue in the body , with an associated increase in strength and power .
this is achieved by stimulating the production of protein in the body .
however , some of the increased muscle bulk may be due to the laying down of water and minerals , so the increase in strength may not be as pronounced as expected .
what are the risks associated with anabolic steroids ?
anabolic steroids promote the growth of many tissues in the body by stimulating the release of the hormone testosterone .
by disturbing the body 's equilibrium , anabolic steroids can potentially cause damage to many of the body 's major organs , particularly the liver , which has to deal with breaking down the compound .
there is also a significant risk of damage to the heart , which is made of muscle tissue .
anabolic steroids can lead to an expansion of the cardiac muscle , which can cause heart attacks .
the drugs also promote the growth of bones , particularly facial bones such as the jaw , and the teeth .
there is also an increased risk of cancer .
other side effects include : development of inappropriate sexual characteristics such as breasts in men , and facial hair in women deepening of the voice baldness male impotence john brewer , director of the human performance centre at the lilleshall national sports centre , said : " the health risks associated with anabolic steroids are as serious as you can get .
" they greatly increase a person 's risk of dying early or of suffering long-term physical problems .
" while the rewards of success in sport are getting greater and greater , the temptation to take anabolic steroids should be offset by the risk of an early grave . "

however , some of the increased muscle bulk may be due to the laying down of water and minerals , so the increase in strength may not be as pronounced as expected .
what are the risks associated with anabolic steroids ?
anabolic steroids promote the growth of many tissues in the body by stimulating the release of the hormone testosterone .
by disturbing the body 's equilibrium , anabolic steroids can potentially cause damage to many of the body 's major organs , particularly the liver , which has to deal with breaking down the compound .
there is also a significant risk of damage to the heart , which is made of muscle tissue .
anabolic steroids can lead to an expansion of the cardiac muscle , which can cause heart attacks .
the drugs also promote the growth of bones , particularly facial bones such as the jaw , and the teeth .
there is also an increased risk of cancer .
other side effects include : development of inappropriate sexual characteristics such as breasts in men , and facial hair in women deepening of the voice baldness male impotence john brewer , director of the human performance centre at the lilleshall national sports centre , said : " the health risks associated with anabolic steroids are as serious as you can get .
" they greatly increase a person 's risk of dying early or of suffering long-term physical problems .
" while the rewards of success in sport are getting greater and greater , the temptation to take anabolic steroids should be offset by the risk of an early grave . "

what is nandrolone ?
nandrolone is a type of anabolic steroid .
it occurs naturally in the body in very tiny quantities , but can also be made synthetically .
it has been banned from sports because of its muscle-boosting abilities .
a number of high-profile sportsmen and women have tested positive for the drug , including linford christie , but have later been cleared of wrongdoing .
are tests for nandrolone conclusive ?
the by-products of nandrolone can be detected in urine .
if they are found at a concentration greater than two nanograms per millilitre -lrb- deemed to be the upper limit at which the substance can occur naturally in the body -rrb- , the sportsperson may be banned .
but while a test can determine the presence of nandrolone the body , it does not necessarily prove wrongdoing .
more nandrolone could be present if the subject has eaten large quantities of meat contaminated with the substance .
certain animals may create a bigger risk , particularly horse and boar - and athletes are warned to avoid eating offal from these animals .
it is also possible that dietary supplements which appear perfectly legal can be broken down by the body to produce the same substances created when nandrolone is broken down .
again , athletes are warned not to believe everything they read on the labels of these supplements .
a uk sport report on nandrolone said : " we recommend that the sports community should be reminded they must maintain a high level of awareness of the possible hazards of using some nutritional supplements and herbal preparations " .
the other source of nandrolone metabolites is other types of steroid - but these are also banned by world sport bodies .
why do sportspeople take substances like nandrolone ?
anabolic steroids can improve the body 's capacity to train and compete at the highest level .
they reduce the fatigue associated with training , and the time required to recover after physical exertion .
they also promote the development of muscle tissue in the body , with an associated increase in strength and power .
this is achieved by stimulating the production of protein in the body .

a format war will be sparked across the globe later in the year when rival format hd-dvd also goes on sale .
the two incompatible formats , backed by a range of different hardware companies and film studios , are vying to become the format of choice to replace dvd .
later this week the bbc news website will be reviewing one of the first blu-ray players to hit the market , the samsung bd-p1000 .
we want you to let us know your questions you want answered on blu-ray technology .
do you have a specific question about high definition dvd technology ?
are you confused about the rival formats ?
do you have a question about samsung 's player ?
thank you for all the questions you have sent .
we will endeavour to answer as many as possible in the review later this week a question i am interested in - is the time taken to retreive the data from one of these new disks any greater than what it is with current cds and dvds ?
steve cassidy , hampshire , uk presumably , hi-def players will be backwards compatible and play all our old dvds but will these players allow them to be ' uprated ' -lrb- rendered at a higher picture quality -rrb- ?
many current , standard definition machines do this so it would seem perverse if new ones did not .
timothy spence , greenwich , london if most film companies support blu-ray and blu-ray can hold far more data , what is the point of hd-dvd ?
jeff culshaw , liverpool , uk what price can we expect the players to fall to by 2012 ?
rob popay , fetcham , leatherhead , uk i 'd like to know why the samsung player is more than twice the cost in the uk compared to america ? £ 900.00 compared to $ 740.00 mike , torquay , uk will either or both or these formats involve the farce that is region coding ?
rich , turks and caicos is hdtv required to reap the full benefits of hd-dvd / blu-ray 's hd capabilities ?
if so , then what does this mean for me and other non-hdtv owners ?
cyberknight , michigan , usa what if neither take off , what 's next ?
adeeb ashfaq , bradford , uk how many times do movie studios expect us to buy the same movies in different formats ?
john dow , united kingdom will any of these new fantastic formats iron-out the unacceptable inherent and noticable four percent speed-up problem which is currently found on every pal dvd movie ? -lrb- incured as a film transfer side -effect -rrb- will we be able to watch films at the correct speed -lrb- i.e 24 frames ber second -rrb- as the movie director originally intended ?
graham mcdonald , addlestone , surrey is the difference from dvd a significant reason to upgrade ?
the advantages dvd had over vhs were great , e.g. higher quality visuals and audio , menus and extra features , optional audio and subtitle langauges , compact for storage , disks do n't wear away etc etc ... is it just video quality that makes the new formats better ?
tom handon , brighton , uk why was n't there a similar format war with dvd ?
stuart m , london , uk is it true that blu-ray disks are more likely to break then hd-dvd disks ?
mark canner , derbyshire , uk will there be a significant cost difference between the players and movie releases for the two formats ?
liam shelley , birmingham , uk would it pass the " mum " test ? i.e. would my mum see an obvious and striking difference between a blu-ray and a hd-dvd picture ?
technophiles may drool over the minutiae but it 's consumers at " mum " level who decide the format winner .
richard ross , egginton , uk will this technology be helpful in preventing piracy ?
sameer rafi , karachi , pakistan i want to know which format will give me better quality video , which of the two have cheaper disc formats and which one is going to be more reliable ?
aiman saleem , quetta , pakistan how long will normal dvd 's remain available ?
i 'm perfectly happy with what i have at the moment , and do n't want to be forced in to upgrading just because the films are no longer available in standard dvd format .
tim jinkerson , uk when will the player that supports both formats be available ?
dual licensing should not be a problem .
otherwise , the constant tug-o-war will result in half the consumers being out of pocket , just like the old betamax-vhs-philips 2000 wars of the late 70 's .
richard beaumont , shipley , west yorkshire is it possible to make a machine that uses both blu-ray and hd-dvd ?
hefin ap llewelyn , neath , wales will the blu-ray disc which has approx six times the memory of a dvd disc give us six movies or the same movie with improved six times visuals ?
since the quality of visual entertainment is poor " content " rather than poor technology , i am not sure i even care what the answer is. pepper constable , lymington , hants what happens when one dies out and you 've got the one that dies out ?

a format war will be sparked across the globe later in the year when rival format hd-dvd also goes on sale .
the two incompatible formats , backed by a range of different hardware companies and film studios , are vying to become the format of choice to replace dvd .
later this week the bbc news website will be reviewing one of the first blu-ray players to hit the market , the samsung bd-p1000 .
we want you to let us know your questions you want answered on blu-ray technology .
do you have a specific question about high definition dvd technology ?
are you confused about the rival formats ?
do you have a question about samsung 's player ?
thank you for all the questions you have sent .
we will endeavour to answer as many as possible in the review later this week a question i am interested in - is the time taken to retreive the data from one of these new disks any greater than what it is with current cds and dvds ?
steve cassidy , hampshire , uk presumably , hi-def players will be backwards compatible and play all our old dvds but will these players allow them to be ' uprated ' -lrb- rendered at a higher picture quality -rrb- ?
many current , standard definition machines do this so it would seem perverse if new ones did not .
timothy spence , greenwich , london if most film companies support blu-ray and blu-ray can hold far more data , what is the point of hd-dvd ?
jeff culshaw , liverpool , uk what price can we expect the players to fall to by 2012 ?
rob popay , fetcham , leatherhead , uk i 'd like to know why the samsung player is more than twice the cost in the uk compared to america ? £ 900.00 compared to $ 740.00 mike , torquay , uk will either or both or these formats involve the farce that is region coding ?
rich , turks and caicos is hdtv required to reap the full benefits of hd-dvd / blu-ray 's hd capabilities ?
if so , then what does this mean for me and other non-hdtv owners ?
cyberknight , michigan , usa what if neither take off , what 's next ?
adeeb ashfaq , bradford , uk how many times do movie studios expect us to buy the same movies in different formats ?
john dow , united kingdom will any of these new fantastic formats iron-out the unacceptable inherent and noticable four percent speed-up problem which is currently found on every pal dvd movie ? -lrb- incured as a film transfer side -effect -rrb- will we be able to watch films at the correct speed -lrb- i.e 24 frames ber second -rrb- as the movie director originally intended ?
graham mcdonald , addlestone , surrey is the difference from dvd a significant reason to upgrade ?
the advantages dvd had over vhs were great , e.g. higher quality visuals and audio , menus and extra features , optional audio and subtitle langauges , compact for storage , disks do n't wear away etc etc ... is it just video quality that makes the new formats better ?
tom handon , brighton , uk why was n't there a similar format war with dvd ?
stuart m , london , uk is it true that blu-ray disks are more likely to break then hd-dvd disks ?
mark canner , derbyshire , uk will there be a significant cost difference between the players and movie releases for the two formats ?
liam shelley , birmingham , uk would it pass the " mum " test ? i.e. would my mum see an obvious and striking difference between a blu-ray and a hd-dvd picture ?
technophiles may drool over the minutiae but it 's consumers at " mum " level who decide the format winner .
richard ross , egginton , uk will this technology be helpful in preventing piracy ?
sameer rafi , karachi , pakistan i want to know which format will give me better quality video , which of the two have cheaper disc formats and which one is going to be more reliable ?
aiman saleem , quetta , pakistan how long will normal dvd 's remain available ?
i 'm perfectly happy with what i have at the moment , and do n't want to be forced in to upgrading just because the films are no longer available in standard dvd format .
tim jinkerson , uk when will the player that supports both formats be available ?
dual licensing should not be a problem .
otherwise , the constant tug-o-war will result in half the consumers being out of pocket , just like the old betamax-vhs-philips 2000 wars of the late 70 's .
richard beaumont , shipley , west yorkshire is it possible to make a machine that uses both blu-ray and hd-dvd ?
hefin ap llewelyn , neath , wales will the blu-ray disc which has approx six times the memory of a dvd disc give us six movies or the same movie with improved six times visuals ?
since the quality of visual entertainment is poor " content " rather than poor technology , i am not sure i even care what the answer is. pepper constable , lymington , hants what happens when one dies out and you 've got the one that dies out ?
what do you do then ?

the two incompatible formats , backed by a range of different hardware companies and film studios , are vying to become the format of choice to replace dvd .
later this week the bbc news website will be reviewing one of the first blu-ray players to hit the market , the samsung bd-p1000 .
we want you to let us know your questions you want answered on blu-ray technology .
do you have a specific question about high definition dvd technology ?
are you confused about the rival formats ?
do you have a question about samsung 's player ?
thank you for all the questions you have sent .
we will endeavour to answer as many as possible in the review later this week a question i am interested in - is the time taken to retreive the data from one of these new disks any greater than what it is with current cds and dvds ?
steve cassidy , hampshire , uk presumably , hi-def players will be backwards compatible and play all our old dvds but will these players allow them to be ' uprated ' -lrb- rendered at a higher picture quality -rrb- ?
many current , standard definition machines do this so it would seem perverse if new ones did not .
timothy spence , greenwich , london if most film companies support blu-ray and blu-ray can hold far more data , what is the point of hd-dvd ?
jeff culshaw , liverpool , uk what price can we expect the players to fall to by 2012 ?
rob popay , fetcham , leatherhead , uk i 'd like to know why the samsung player is more than twice the cost in the uk compared to america ? £ 900.00 compared to $ 740.00 mike , torquay , uk will either or both or these formats involve the farce that is region coding ?
rich , turks and caicos is hdtv required to reap the full benefits of hd-dvd / blu-ray 's hd capabilities ?
if so , then what does this mean for me and other non-hdtv owners ?
cyberknight , michigan , usa what if neither take off , what 's next ?
adeeb ashfaq , bradford , uk how many times do movie studios expect us to buy the same movies in different formats ?
john dow , united kingdom will any of these new fantastic formats iron-out the unacceptable inherent and noticable four percent speed-up problem which is currently found on every pal dvd movie ? -lrb- incured as a film transfer side -effect -rrb- will we be able to watch films at the correct speed -lrb- i.e 24 frames ber second -rrb- as the movie director originally intended ?
graham mcdonald , addlestone , surrey is the difference from dvd a significant reason to upgrade ?
the advantages dvd had over vhs were great , e.g. higher quality visuals and audio , menus and extra features , optional audio and subtitle langauges , compact for storage , disks do n't wear away etc etc ... is it just video quality that makes the new formats better ?
tom handon , brighton , uk why was n't there a similar format war with dvd ?
stuart m , london , uk is it true that blu-ray disks are more likely to break then hd-dvd disks ?
mark canner , derbyshire , uk will there be a significant cost difference between the players and movie releases for the two formats ?
liam shelley , birmingham , uk would it pass the " mum " test ? i.e. would my mum see an obvious and striking difference between a blu-ray and a hd-dvd picture ?
technophiles may drool over the minutiae but it 's consumers at " mum " level who decide the format winner .

aiman saleem , quetta , pakistan how long will normal dvd 's remain available ?
i 'm perfectly happy with what i have at the moment , and do n't want to be forced in to upgrading just because the films are no longer available in standard dvd format .
tim jinkerson , uk when will the player that supports both formats be available ?
dual licensing should not be a problem .
otherwise , the constant tug-o-war will result in half the consumers being out of pocket , just like the old betamax-vhs-philips 2000 wars of the late 70 's .
richard beaumont , shipley , west yorkshire is it possible to make a machine that uses both blu-ray and hd-dvd ?
hefin ap llewelyn , neath , wales will the blu-ray disc which has approx six times the memory of a dvd disc give us six movies or the same movie with improved six times visuals ?
since the quality of visual entertainment is poor " content " rather than poor technology , i am not sure i even care what the answer is. pepper constable , lymington , hants what happens when one dies out and you 've got the one that dies out ?
what do you do then ?
damien pantony , southwick , uk will either of the new hd formats play the current dvd standard definition format , and home recorded dvds -lrb- -r , + r and so forth -rrb- ?

a format war will be sparked across the globe later in the year when rival format hd-dvd also goes on sale .
the two incompatible formats , backed by a range of different hardware companies and film studios , are vying to become the format of choice to replace dvd .
later this week the bbc news website will be reviewing one of the first blu-ray players to hit the market , the samsung bd-p1000 .
we want you to let us know your questions you want answered on blu-ray technology .
do you have a specific question about high definition dvd technology ?
are you confused about the rival formats ?
do you have a question about samsung 's player ?
thank you for all the questions you have sent .
we will endeavour to answer as many as possible in the review later this week a question i am interested in - is the time taken to retreive the data from one of these new disks any greater than what it is with current cds and dvds ?
steve cassidy , hampshire , uk presumably , hi-def players will be backwards compatible and play all our old dvds but will these players allow them to be ' uprated ' -lrb- rendered at a higher picture quality -rrb- ?
many current , standard definition machines do this so it would seem perverse if new ones did not .

some inmates claimed they could " get anything " in jails , with heroin among the most widely-used drugs .
some of the prisoners claimed that drug testing could actually lead to first time heroin use because it does not stay in the body as long as cannabis .
the scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- insisted it was not complacent about the problem of drugs in prisons .
researchers spoke to both inmates and prison staff .
the general public have a right to expect that prisons should be drug free margaret mitchell tory justice spokesman they found that some staff felt limited in what they could do about drug use and a number of prisoners reported officers turning a " blind eye " .
the conservatives ' justice spokeswoman margaret mitchell told the bbc 's good morning scotland programme : " this report is much more alarming than we can possibly imagine .
" the general public have a right to expect that prisons should be drug free and every effort should be made to ensure that these prisons are drug free .
" we have to look at every instance where drugs are smuggled into prisons and put a block on that . "
she said there were problems with understaffing , low morale and a " resigned attitude " to drugs in prisons and that there needed to be more prison rehabilitation programmes .

" if there needs to be more sniffer dogs or glass partitions to stop drugs being passed over during visiting , then so be it .

andrew fraser , director of health and care for the sps , said some of the concerns were already being addressed .
he said a lot more resources had gone into counselling support and the medical and nursing aspect .
" we know the majority of people who come into prison have an addiction , mostly heroin but usually a cocktail of heroin with other drugs and alcohol . "
he added that heroin did not stay in the body as long as cannabis and was easier to bring into prison and conceal .
" the prison drug problem reflects what 's going on outside in the community and heroin is a very prominent drug , " he said .

strathclyde police rejected eight candidates in the last two years for having a form of colourblindness usually only found in men .
but a landmark legal case in england found that a colourblind officer faced indirect sexual discrimination .
candidates may now use the precedent to seek thousands in compensation .
robin dixon was one candidate who was turned down by strathclyde police .
his family hoped that the precedent set by the tribunal against hertfordshire constabulary could be used in scotland . "
he has been made to feel that he is a total liability and we are considering pursuing this as a sexual discrimination case " marie dixon his mother marie dixon , from east kilbride , said : " this has been a david versus goliath case , with the country 's largest force digging their heels in .
" there is something very wrong here when the force rejects candidates despite the evidence .
" his condition means that he only has problems differentiating between shades of green .
he is distraught that he has not been accepted after being suitable in every other way .
" he has been made to feel that he is a total liability and we are considering pursuing this as a sexual discrimination case . "
mr dixon took his rejection to an employment tribunal but his complaint against strathclyde police was rejected on a technicality as it was time-barred .
his application was rejected despite being told by ch insp douglas campbell that he would have made a good constable .
lynn welsh , the disability rights commission 's head of scottish legal affairs , called for clarification over the issue of colourblind recruits .
she said : " there is an issue around whether colourblindness is a disability or not under the disability discrimination act .
" it depends on whether it has a substantial long-term effect on the person 's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities and so any reasonable adjustments made under the dda would depend on the individual concerned . "
a strathclyde police spokeswoman said that they could not comment on specific cases , such as mr dixon 's , because he had lodged an employment tribunal appeal .

the food watch survey of 2,240 patients in england found more than a third had abandoned their food , and 40 % have had food brought in by visitors .
around 26 % who needed help with eating did not receive any , it added and 22 % found their meals too hot or too cold .
the commission for patient and public involvement in health is calling on the government to improve food standards .
some 18 % of those questioned said they did not always have their choice of meal , and 81 % said they had no choice of meals in advance .
' disappointing ' the report was conducted by patient and public involvement forums at 97 hospitals across england .
sharon grant , chair of the commission for patient and public involvement in health , said the findings were " disappointing " . "
this survey is further damning evidence that many hospitals are putting lives at risk by failing to provide patients with basic care " gordon lishman , age concern " proper nutrition is essential to recovery both physically and psychologically , " she said .
" patients have every right to expect food that is nutritious , served at the appropriate temperature , meets their dietary needs and help to eat if they need it . "
" not only will this impact upon a patient 's recovery , but is a huge waste in terms of nhs money and resources , " she added .
ms grant said the survey had revealed examples where the food was of a good standard , but the forums had been shocked by the comments from some patients .
she added the findings would be sent to health secretary patricia hewitt in a bid to improve standards across the board .
age concern england director general gordon lishman said hospitals needed to urgently address the problem .
" this survey is further damning evidence that many hospitals are putting lives at risk by failing to provide patients with basic care .
" it 's a fact that malnourished patients stay in hospital for longer , are three times as likely to develop complications during surgery and have a higher mortality rate . "
but health minister andy burnham said hospital food had improved significantly over the past few years , although he said more action was needed .

a us team found injecting rats with stem cells delayed the onset of mnd .
writing in the transplantation , the researchers from johns hopkins medical institutions warned clinical use of stem cells was still a long way off .
but they said their findings would help scientists to better understand how stem cells behaved when they were transplanted into the body .
the spinal cord has long been considered an environment unfavourable to this type of transformation dr vassilis koliatsos motor neurone disease -lrb- mnd -rrb- affects about 5,000 people in the uk .
it is a progressive disorder caused by the break-down of the nerve cells , called motor neurones , which control the muscle activity .
it is characterised by muscle-wasting , loss of mobility , and difficulties with speech , swallowing and breathing .
to investigate whether stem cells - cells that can transform into any type of cell in the body - could help mnd sufferers , scientists injected rats , bred to carry the most common form of mnd , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- ams -rrb- , with live human stem cells into their lower spines .
living longer they found that 70 % of the transplanted cells developed into new nerve cells , and many of them had grown new endings connecting with other cells in the rats ' spinal cords .
the onset of the disease , marked by weight loss , was also delayed .
it began on average at 59 days , in the rats injected with live stem cells , compared with 52 days for control rats that had been injected with dead , and therefore inactive , stem cells .
they also discovered the rats with live stem cells grew weaker more slowly and lived longer than those that had received dead stem cell transplants .
dr vassilis koliatsos , from johns hopkins medical institutions , who worked on the study , said : " we were extremely surprised to see that the grafted stem cells were not negatively affected by the degenerating cells around them , as many feared introducing healthy cells into a diseased environment would only kill them .
" these stem cells differentiate massively into neurons , a pleasant surprise given that the spinal cord has long been considered an environment unfavourable to this type of transformation . "
the researchers said their findings were a " proof of principle " , and cautioned that more work would need to be done on rats and humans before stem cell treatments could move into the clinic .
belinda cupid , research manager at the mnd association , said : " there is an urgent need to conduct research into mnd .
the causes of the disease are unknown and there is no cure .
therefore the mnd association welcomes the findings of this new research .
" exactly how stem cells may help motor neurones in mnd is very complex .
it might be that they can replace the motor neurones or they may improve their environment .

a us team found injecting rats with stem cells delayed the onset of mnd .
writing in the transplantation , the researchers from johns hopkins medical institutions warned clinical use of stem cells was still a long way off .
but they said their findings would help scientists to better understand how stem cells behaved when they were transplanted into the body .
the spinal cord has long been considered an environment unfavourable to this type of transformation dr vassilis koliatsos motor neurone disease -lrb- mnd -rrb- affects about 5,000 people in the uk .
it is a progressive disorder caused by the break-down of the nerve cells , called motor neurones , which control the muscle activity .
it is characterised by muscle-wasting , loss of mobility , and difficulties with speech , swallowing and breathing .
to investigate whether stem cells - cells that can transform into any type of cell in the body - could help mnd sufferers , scientists injected rats , bred to carry the most common form of mnd , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -lrb- ams -rrb- , with live human stem cells into their lower spines .
living longer they found that 70 % of the transplanted cells developed into new nerve cells , and many of them had grown new endings connecting with other cells in the rats ' spinal cords .
the onset of the disease , marked by weight loss , was also delayed .
it began on average at 59 days , in the rats injected with live stem cells , compared with 52 days for control rats that had been injected with dead , and therefore inactive , stem cells .
they also discovered the rats with live stem cells grew weaker more slowly and lived longer than those that had received dead stem cell transplants .
dr vassilis koliatsos , from johns hopkins medical institutions , who worked on the study , said : " we were extremely surprised to see that the grafted stem cells were not negatively affected by the degenerating cells around them , as many feared introducing healthy cells into a diseased environment would only kill them .
" these stem cells differentiate massively into neurons , a pleasant surprise given that the spinal cord has long been considered an environment unfavourable to this type of transformation . "
the researchers said their findings were a " proof of principle " , and cautioned that more work would need to be done on rats and humans before stem cell treatments could move into the clinic .
belinda cupid , research manager at the mnd association , said : " there is an urgent need to conduct research into mnd .
the causes of the disease are unknown and there is no cure .
therefore the mnd association welcomes the findings of this new research .
" exactly how stem cells may help motor neurones in mnd is very complex .
it might be that they can replace the motor neurones or they may improve their environment .

education secretary alan johnson gave schools the go-ahead to carry out spot searches using metal detectors which can show up weapons under clothing .
he said government lawyers had confirmed that introducing such screening in schools was lawful .
the move has been welcomed by teaching unions including the association of school and college leaders and nasuwt .
screening would involve pupils ' walking through an arch or being checked with a metal detector wand .
random legislation within the education and inspections bill , currently going through parliament , will give teachers the right to carry out hands-on searches without pupils ' prior consent .
but new guidance being issued to schools on searching for weapons clarifies that detectors which do not require physical contact with pupils can already be used at random .
new legislation is not required for these screening techniques .
