" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .

" communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the world cup circus rolls on to germany from soccer yard to world-class stadium the specter of hooliganism returns the world cup , german money-maker germany plans star-studded opening gala for world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.01.2006 klinsmann more confident of win than most germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of these three really thinks germany will win the world cup while nearly two-thirds of germans are convinced their team won ’ t be raising the trophy at this summer ’ s world cup , coach jürgen klinnsmann said the german team only needs to work on few kinks . possibly due to germany 's preliminary group matches against costa rica , poland and ecuador , klinsmann has changed his tune from needing " a lot of luck " to win the world cup to pure confidence his side will make it to the final .
" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .
we will go all the way because we saw during the confederation cup that we are getting the balance of the team right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , trying to convince bastian schweinsteiger he can win the cup but klinsmann 's certainty does n't seem to be trickling down through the germany roster to the fans .
excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .
the former international striker and world champion has been the subject of heavy criticism over his decision to continue to live in the united states , his indecision over which goalkeeper to select and his tactical philosophy .
but klinsmann insists everything is right on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican mystic said a german win is in the cards " we are sure we are on course and we will use the next few months to fine tune things , " he said .
" we will then be very difficult to beat . "
klinsmann , and germany fans , should not doubt the host team , according to tarot card reader antonio vazquez , mexico 's self-proclaimed " grand warlock . "
" i see germany and nothing more , " he told reporters in mexico city .
then again , fans may have reason to question the prediction - vazquez foresaw a european winner at the 2002 tournament . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oliver kahn : germany can win the soccer world cup some revere oliver kahn as a gift to german soccer , others see him as arrogant and smug .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .

apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .

they regularly patrol during political summits and were also present at the 2004 athens olympics and pope benedict xvi 's world youth day visit to cologne last summer . the interior ministry requested that nato provide surveillance planes to prevent private aircraft from overflying the stadiums , a spokesman told the ap news agency on the condition of anonymity . run by germany and 11 other nations , the 17-plane awacs fleet has its closest base near the western german city of aachen , meaning the pilots wo n't have a long commute to work during the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . no tanks in front of stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble while politicians in berlin do not have a problem with the security planes making the rounds well out of sight above the stadiums , there is quite a bit of opposition to plans to have the german military on hand at the stadiums . schäule -lrb- photo -rrb- has said he fears police forces could be overwhelmed by the tournament 's security issues .

different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners . " the tone of her comments shows that while she has maintained that repairing the damaged transatlantic relationship is a priority of her foreign affairs agenda , the chancellor will not be shying away from speaking out on issues where disagreement exists . repairing damaged a relations a priority but not at any cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush met from time to time but only when protocol demanded .
relations between germany and the united states reached a post-war unprecedented low during the chancellorship of merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder who adopted a strong anti-war stance on the issue of iraq to win the 2002 general election .
consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .
the chancellor , who will meet with george w. bush on friday , said that she intends to talk to president about the fight against terrorism .
" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

the two neighbors reached a compromise 5-year supply deal earlier this week . germany to push eu constitution when bloc president in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is a strong believer in the eu constitution .
turning her attention to the eu , merkel said that the contentious issue of the bloc 's ailing constitution plans would be tackled head on by the german eu presidency in 2007 , though much groundwork was needed in the time between . " we need to have an all-encompassing discussion again , " merkel said .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .

some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.01.2006 long good-bye to berlin 's palace of the republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyesore or cultural monument ?
berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .
experts reckon that well over a billion euros would be required - money that neither the state of berlin nor private organizations are able to raise . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .
the condition of a fourth sibling , a six-year-old boy , was reportedly improving . it is thought that the bad winter conditions in the area forced the family to bring their infected poultry flock into the home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics and family members carry the coffin of mehmet kocyigit .
the kocyigit siblings and most of the other patients in van were from the remote town of dogubeyazit , less then 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the town of aralik , at the armenian border , which was quarantined last week after poultry tested positive for bird flu . as veterinary experts culled fowl and disinfected the areas , agriculture minister mehdi eker announced friday that bird flu has been found in two wild ducks near the capital ankara , nearly 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 700 miles -rrb- west of the infected area . the discovery raised fears that migratory birds may be spreading the disease across the vast country , as experts had warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu claims third victim in turkey officials confirmed three children from the same family have died from bird flu in eastern turkey , marking a major shift westwards to the edge of europe of a disease that has so far claimed lives in eastern asia .

trying to calm fears of a witch-hunt , officials pointed out background checks on more than 10,000 people associated with last year 's confederations cup led to only " one or two " people being barred from working at the event . awacs to help secure german airspace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadium cleaning staff will be check for terrorist connections german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also sent a request to defense minister franz josef jung on thursday asking for deployment of nato 's awacs surveillance planes during the world cup , which stars june 9 and ends july 9 . it has become common practice for the security planes to circle overhead whenever massive crowds gather together .
they regularly patrol during political summits and were also present at the 2004 athens olympics and pope benedict xvi 's world youth day visit to cologne last summer . the interior ministry requested that nato provide surveillance planes to prevent private aircraft from overflying the stadiums , a spokesman told the ap news agency on the condition of anonymity . run by germany and 11 other nations , the 17-plane awacs fleet has its closest base near the western german city of aachen , meaning the pilots wo n't have a long commute to work during the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . no tanks in front of stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble while politicians in berlin do not have a problem with the security planes making the rounds well out of sight above the stadiums , there is quite a bit of opposition to plans to have the german military on hand at the stadiums . schäule -lrb- photo -rrb- has said he fears police forces could be overwhelmed by the tournament 's security issues .
while he admitted placing tanks in front of the stadiums would be a bad idea , he said he could imagine soldiers protecting foreign embassies other international institutions in germany . police forces are against an increased military presence in german cities during the world cup and called schäuble 's suggestion ineffective . " it is an annoying discussion that will not yield the results desired , " konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , told the berliner zeitung friday . police " sufficiently " prepared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans outside the stadiums could be more problematic than those with tickets it 's not necessarily what happens at the stadiums themselves that has police most concerned .
fans without tickets who watch the matches at bars and public viewing events - and who wo n't be subject to stadium security checks and alcohol-free beer - then meet later on the street have police worried more than what may happen in the stands . jürgen mathies , head of the world cup 's police deployment working group , told the newspaper he was confident police vacation bans would ensure safety during the tournament .

" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian leaders back government reforms bosnian leaders pledged to implement sweeping constitutional reforms aimed at ending lingering ethnic divisions in their country and also called for the surrender or arrest of two top serb war crimes suspects .

" people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so .

different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners . " the tone of her comments shows that while she has maintained that repairing the damaged transatlantic relationship is a priority of her foreign affairs agenda , the chancellor will not be shying away from speaking out on issues where disagreement exists . repairing damaged a relations a priority but not at any cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush met from time to time but only when protocol demanded .
relations between germany and the united states reached a post-war unprecedented low during the chancellorship of merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder who adopted a strong anti-war stance on the issue of iraq to win the 2002 general election .
consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .
the chancellor , who will meet with george w. bush on friday , said that she intends to talk to president about the fight against terrorism .
" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .
experts reckon that well over a billion euros would be required - money that neither the state of berlin nor private organizations are able to raise . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .
the condition of a fourth sibling , a six-year-old boy , was reportedly improving . it is thought that the bad winter conditions in the area forced the family to bring their infected poultry flock into the home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics and family members carry the coffin of mehmet kocyigit .
the kocyigit siblings and most of the other patients in van were from the remote town of dogubeyazit , less then 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the town of aralik , at the armenian border , which was quarantined last week after poultry tested positive for bird flu . as veterinary experts culled fowl and disinfected the areas , agriculture minister mehdi eker announced friday that bird flu has been found in two wild ducks near the capital ankara , nearly 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 700 miles -rrb- west of the infected area . the discovery raised fears that migratory birds may be spreading the disease across the vast country , as experts had warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu claims third victim in turkey officials confirmed three children from the same family have died from bird flu in eastern turkey , marking a major shift westwards to the edge of europe of a disease that has so far claimed lives in eastern asia .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .
experts reckon that well over a billion euros would be required - money that neither the state of berlin nor private organizations are able to raise . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .

" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .
we will go all the way because we saw during the confederation cup that we are getting the balance of the team right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , trying to convince bastian schweinsteiger he can win the cup but klinsmann 's certainty does n't seem to be trickling down through the germany roster to the fans .
excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .
the former international striker and world champion has been the subject of heavy criticism over his decision to continue to live in the united states , his indecision over which goalkeeper to select and his tactical philosophy .
but klinsmann insists everything is right on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican mystic said a german win is in the cards " we are sure we are on course and we will use the next few months to fine tune things , " he said .

trying to calm fears of a witch-hunt , officials pointed out background checks on more than 10,000 people associated with last year 's confederations cup led to only " one or two " people being barred from working at the event . awacs to help secure german airspace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadium cleaning staff will be check for terrorist connections german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also sent a request to defense minister franz josef jung on thursday asking for deployment of nato 's awacs surveillance planes during the world cup , which stars june 9 and ends july 9 . it has become common practice for the security planes to circle overhead whenever massive crowds gather together .
they regularly patrol during political summits and were also present at the 2004 athens olympics and pope benedict xvi 's world youth day visit to cologne last summer . the interior ministry requested that nato provide surveillance planes to prevent private aircraft from overflying the stadiums , a spokesman told the ap news agency on the condition of anonymity . run by germany and 11 other nations , the 17-plane awacs fleet has its closest base near the western german city of aachen , meaning the pilots wo n't have a long commute to work during the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . no tanks in front of stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble while politicians in berlin do not have a problem with the security planes making the rounds well out of sight above the stadiums , there is quite a bit of opposition to plans to have the german military on hand at the stadiums . schäule -lrb- photo -rrb- has said he fears police forces could be overwhelmed by the tournament 's security issues .
while he admitted placing tanks in front of the stadiums would be a bad idea , he said he could imagine soldiers protecting foreign embassies other international institutions in germany . police forces are against an increased military presence in german cities during the world cup and called schäuble 's suggestion ineffective . " it is an annoying discussion that will not yield the results desired , " konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , told the berliner zeitung friday . police " sufficiently " prepared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans outside the stadiums could be more problematic than those with tickets it 's not necessarily what happens at the stadiums themselves that has police most concerned .
fans without tickets who watch the matches at bars and public viewing events - and who wo n't be subject to stadium security checks and alcohol-free beer - then meet later on the street have police worried more than what may happen in the stands . jürgen mathies , head of the world cup 's police deployment working group , told the newspaper he was confident police vacation bans would ensure safety during the tournament .

trying to calm fears of a witch-hunt , officials pointed out background checks on more than 10,000 people associated with last year 's confederations cup led to only " one or two " people being barred from working at the event . awacs to help secure german airspace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadium cleaning staff will be check for terrorist connections german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also sent a request to defense minister franz josef jung on thursday asking for deployment of nato 's awacs surveillance planes during the world cup , which stars june 9 and ends july 9 . it has become common practice for the security planes to circle overhead whenever massive crowds gather together .
they regularly patrol during political summits and were also present at the 2004 athens olympics and pope benedict xvi 's world youth day visit to cologne last summer . the interior ministry requested that nato provide surveillance planes to prevent private aircraft from overflying the stadiums , a spokesman told the ap news agency on the condition of anonymity . run by germany and 11 other nations , the 17-plane awacs fleet has its closest base near the western german city of aachen , meaning the pilots wo n't have a long commute to work during the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . no tanks in front of stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble while politicians in berlin do not have a problem with the security planes making the rounds well out of sight above the stadiums , there is quite a bit of opposition to plans to have the german military on hand at the stadiums . schäule -lrb- photo -rrb- has said he fears police forces could be overwhelmed by the tournament 's security issues .
while he admitted placing tanks in front of the stadiums would be a bad idea , he said he could imagine soldiers protecting foreign embassies other international institutions in germany . police forces are against an increased military presence in german cities during the world cup and called schäuble 's suggestion ineffective . " it is an annoying discussion that will not yield the results desired , " konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , told the berliner zeitung friday . police " sufficiently " prepared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans outside the stadiums could be more problematic than those with tickets it 's not necessarily what happens at the stadiums themselves that has police most concerned .
fans without tickets who watch the matches at bars and public viewing events - and who wo n't be subject to stadium security checks and alcohol-free beer - then meet later on the street have police worried more than what may happen in the stands . jürgen mathies , head of the world cup 's police deployment working group , told the newspaper he was confident police vacation bans would ensure safety during the tournament .

" in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .

bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .

" people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.01.2006 two new cases of bird flu in humans confirmed in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who experts in turkey are assessing the threat as two more cases were confirmed two children in turkey are the latest confirmed cases of bird flu in humans , doctors revealed sunday .
the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .

" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .

excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .
the former international striker and world champion has been the subject of heavy criticism over his decision to continue to live in the united states , his indecision over which goalkeeper to select and his tactical philosophy .
but klinsmann insists everything is right on track .

" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet .

" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet .

" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .

fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .

any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .

consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .

" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

turning her attention to the eu , merkel said that the contentious issue of the bloc 's ailing constitution plans would be tackled head on by the german eu presidency in 2007 , though much groundwork was needed in the time between .

recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .
the chancellor , who will meet with george w. bush on friday , said that she intends to talk to president about the fight against terrorism .
" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

the two neighbors reached a compromise 5-year supply deal earlier this week . germany to push eu constitution when bloc president in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is a strong believer in the eu constitution .
turning her attention to the eu , merkel said that the contentious issue of the bloc 's ailing constitution plans would be tackled head on by the german eu presidency in 2007 , though much groundwork was needed in the time between . " we need to have an all-encompassing discussion again , " merkel said .
" i think it would be good if europe stayed with the thought of having a constitution .
i will lobby for that .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .
experts reckon that well over a billion euros would be required - money that neither the state of berlin nor private organizations are able to raise . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "
unavailable under communism but the girl 's parents would have been unlikely to come across cannabis , or any other illegal drugs in communist czechoslovakia , said former dissident josef rauvolf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the czechs ' drug of choice - along with alcohol " of course people knew about cannabis , but they mostly just knew about it , " rauvolf recalled .
" some lucky ones had access to either homegrown or smuggled -lrb- marijuana -rrb- - well , mostly homegrown because smuggling could get you two years in prison at least .
the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .
if you had it in your garden nobody could call the police , because they did n't know what it was . "
the situation has changed immensely since the velvet revolution , said rauvolf .
and not just among the younger generation .
" the attitude to marijuana is quite liberal , even among just normal , average people .
people in small villages smoke it , and they do n't take it as something special .
they are just having a few beers , so they have a few joints .
it 's not like it used to be - intellectuals or the underground , so-called counterculture .
no , it 's normal people , people driving tractors or whatever . "
pleasure principle but how has cannabis become such a normal part of life for czechs ?
" we can take it optimistically : that we are an open society and our youngsters are good enough and free enough to speak about it , " explained the founder of prague 's dropin drug clinic , ivan douda . douda said that the development may also have positive side .
" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .
pragmatic approach the legal situation in the czech republic is somewhat confusing : possession of an undefined " amount not bigger than a small amount " is considered only a misdemeanor .
douda praised a new bill currently before the czech parliament that should make things more clear .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "
unavailable under communism but the girl 's parents would have been unlikely to come across cannabis , or any other illegal drugs in communist czechoslovakia , said former dissident josef rauvolf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the czechs ' drug of choice - along with alcohol " of course people knew about cannabis , but they mostly just knew about it , " rauvolf recalled .
" some lucky ones had access to either homegrown or smuggled -lrb- marijuana -rrb- - well , mostly homegrown because smuggling could get you two years in prison at least .
the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .

the situation has changed immensely since the velvet revolution , said rauvolf .
and not just among the younger generation .
" the attitude to marijuana is quite liberal , even among just normal , average people .
people in small villages smoke it , and they do n't take it as something special .
they are just having a few beers , so they have a few joints .

" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "
unavailable under communism but the girl 's parents would have been unlikely to come across cannabis , or any other illegal drugs in communist czechoslovakia , said former dissident josef rauvolf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the czechs ' drug of choice - along with alcohol " of course people knew about cannabis , but they mostly just knew about it , " rauvolf recalled .
" some lucky ones had access to either homegrown or smuggled -lrb- marijuana -rrb- - well , mostly homegrown because smuggling could get you two years in prison at least .
the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .
if you had it in your garden nobody could call the police , because they did n't know what it was . "
the situation has changed immensely since the velvet revolution , said rauvolf .
and not just among the younger generation .
" the attitude to marijuana is quite liberal , even among just normal , average people .
people in small villages smoke it , and they do n't take it as something special .
they are just having a few beers , so they have a few joints .
it 's not like it used to be - intellectuals or the underground , so-called counterculture .
no , it 's normal people , people driving tractors or whatever . "
pleasure principle but how has cannabis become such a normal part of life for czechs ?
" we can take it optimistically : that we are an open society and our youngsters are good enough and free enough to speak about it , " explained the founder of prague 's dropin drug clinic , ivan douda . douda said that the development may also have positive side .
" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .

" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the world cup circus rolls on to germany from soccer yard to world-class stadium the specter of hooliganism returns the world cup , german money-maker germany plans star-studded opening gala for world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.01.2006 klinsmann more confident of win than most germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of these three really thinks germany will win the world cup while nearly two-thirds of germans are convinced their team won ’ t be raising the trophy at this summer ’ s world cup , coach jürgen klinnsmann said the german team only needs to work on few kinks . possibly due to germany 's preliminary group matches against costa rica , poland and ecuador , klinsmann has changed his tune from needing " a lot of luck " to win the world cup to pure confidence his side will make it to the final .
" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .
we will go all the way because we saw during the confederation cup that we are getting the balance of the team right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , trying to convince bastian schweinsteiger he can win the cup but klinsmann 's certainty does n't seem to be trickling down through the germany roster to the fans .
excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .
the former international striker and world champion has been the subject of heavy criticism over his decision to continue to live in the united states , his indecision over which goalkeeper to select and his tactical philosophy .
but klinsmann insists everything is right on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican mystic said a german win is in the cards " we are sure we are on course and we will use the next few months to fine tune things , " he said .
" we will then be very difficult to beat . "
klinsmann , and germany fans , should not doubt the host team , according to tarot card reader antonio vazquez , mexico 's self-proclaimed " grand warlock . "
" i see germany and nothing more , " he told reporters in mexico city .
then again , fans may have reason to question the prediction - vazquez foresaw a european winner at the 2002 tournament . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oliver kahn : germany can win the soccer world cup some revere oliver kahn as a gift to german soccer , others see him as arrogant and smug .

" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .
we will go all the way because we saw during the confederation cup that we are getting the balance of the team right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , trying to convince bastian schweinsteiger he can win the cup but klinsmann 's certainty does n't seem to be trickling down through the germany roster to the fans .
excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .
the former international striker and world champion has been the subject of heavy criticism over his decision to continue to live in the united states , his indecision over which goalkeeper to select and his tactical philosophy .
but klinsmann insists everything is right on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican mystic said a german win is in the cards " we are sure we are on course and we will use the next few months to fine tune things , " he said .
" we will then be very difficult to beat . "
klinsmann , and germany fans , should not doubt the host team , according to tarot card reader antonio vazquez , mexico 's self-proclaimed " grand warlock . "

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .
the condition of a fourth sibling , a six-year-old boy , was reportedly improving . it is thought that the bad winter conditions in the area forced the family to bring their infected poultry flock into the home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics and family members carry the coffin of mehmet kocyigit .
the kocyigit siblings and most of the other patients in van were from the remote town of dogubeyazit , less then 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the town of aralik , at the armenian border , which was quarantined last week after poultry tested positive for bird flu . as veterinary experts culled fowl and disinfected the areas , agriculture minister mehdi eker announced friday that bird flu has been found in two wild ducks near the capital ankara , nearly 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 700 miles -rrb- west of the infected area . the discovery raised fears that migratory birds may be spreading the disease across the vast country , as experts had warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu claims third victim in turkey officials confirmed three children from the same family have died from bird flu in eastern turkey , marking a major shift westwards to the edge of europe of a disease that has so far claimed lives in eastern asia .

different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners . " the tone of her comments shows that while she has maintained that repairing the damaged transatlantic relationship is a priority of her foreign affairs agenda , the chancellor will not be shying away from speaking out on issues where disagreement exists . repairing damaged a relations a priority but not at any cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush met from time to time but only when protocol demanded .
relations between germany and the united states reached a post-war unprecedented low during the chancellorship of merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder who adopted a strong anti-war stance on the issue of iraq to win the 2002 general election .
consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .
the chancellor , who will meet with george w. bush on friday , said that she intends to talk to president about the fight against terrorism .
" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

the two neighbors reached a compromise 5-year supply deal earlier this week . germany to push eu constitution when bloc president in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is a strong believer in the eu constitution .
turning her attention to the eu , merkel said that the contentious issue of the bloc 's ailing constitution plans would be tackled head on by the german eu presidency in 2007 , though much groundwork was needed in the time between . " we need to have an all-encompassing discussion again , " merkel said .

different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners .

relations between germany and the united states reached a post-war unprecedented low during the chancellorship of merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder who adopted a strong anti-war stance on the issue of iraq to win the 2002 general election .
consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .

" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way .

merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners . " the tone of her comments shows that while she has maintained that repairing the damaged transatlantic relationship is a priority of her foreign affairs agenda , the chancellor will not be shying away from speaking out on issues where disagreement exists . repairing damaged a relations a priority but not at any cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush met from time to time but only when protocol demanded .
relations between germany and the united states reached a post-war unprecedented low during the chancellorship of merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder who adopted a strong anti-war stance on the issue of iraq to win the 2002 general election .
consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .
the chancellor , who will meet with george w. bush on friday , said that she intends to talk to president about the fight against terrorism .
" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .

the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .
the condition of a fourth sibling , a six-year-old boy , was reportedly improving . it is thought that the bad winter conditions in the area forced the family to bring their infected poultry flock into the home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics and family members carry the coffin of mehmet kocyigit .
the kocyigit siblings and most of the other patients in van were from the remote town of dogubeyazit , less then 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the town of aralik , at the armenian border , which was quarantined last week after poultry tested positive for bird flu . as veterinary experts culled fowl and disinfected the areas , agriculture minister mehdi eker announced friday that bird flu has been found in two wild ducks near the capital ankara , nearly 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 700 miles -rrb- west of the infected area . the discovery raised fears that migratory birds may be spreading the disease across the vast country , as experts had warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu claims third victim in turkey officials confirmed three children from the same family have died from bird flu in eastern turkey , marking a major shift westwards to the edge of europe of a disease that has so far claimed lives in eastern asia .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "
unavailable under communism but the girl 's parents would have been unlikely to come across cannabis , or any other illegal drugs in communist czechoslovakia , said former dissident josef rauvolf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the czechs ' drug of choice - along with alcohol " of course people knew about cannabis , but they mostly just knew about it , " rauvolf recalled .
" some lucky ones had access to either homegrown or smuggled -lrb- marijuana -rrb- - well , mostly homegrown because smuggling could get you two years in prison at least .
the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .
if you had it in your garden nobody could call the police , because they did n't know what it was . "
the situation has changed immensely since the velvet revolution , said rauvolf .
and not just among the younger generation .
" the attitude to marijuana is quite liberal , even among just normal , average people .
people in small villages smoke it , and they do n't take it as something special .
they are just having a few beers , so they have a few joints .
it 's not like it used to be - intellectuals or the underground , so-called counterculture .
no , it 's normal people , people driving tractors or whatever . "
pleasure principle but how has cannabis become such a normal part of life for czechs ?
" we can take it optimistically : that we are an open society and our youngsters are good enough and free enough to speak about it , " explained the founder of prague 's dropin drug clinic , ivan douda . douda said that the development may also have positive side .
" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .
pragmatic approach the legal situation in the czech republic is somewhat confusing : possession of an undefined " amount not bigger than a small amount " is considered only a misdemeanor .
douda praised a new bill currently before the czech parliament that should make things more clear .
" we will have some stratification , some drug categories , and marijuana will be on the low level , " he said . ian willoughby -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech republic is eu cannabis capital less than two years into its eu membership , the czech republic has already gained notoriety as the european frontrunner when it comes to beer drinking and dope smoking .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .

sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .
the condition of a fourth sibling , a six-year-old boy , was reportedly improving . it is thought that the bad winter conditions in the area forced the family to bring their infected poultry flock into the home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics and family members carry the coffin of mehmet kocyigit .
the kocyigit siblings and most of the other patients in van were from the remote town of dogubeyazit , less then 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the town of aralik , at the armenian border , which was quarantined last week after poultry tested positive for bird flu . as veterinary experts culled fowl and disinfected the areas , agriculture minister mehdi eker announced friday that bird flu has been found in two wild ducks near the capital ankara , nearly 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 700 miles -rrb- west of the infected area . the discovery raised fears that migratory birds may be spreading the disease across the vast country , as experts had warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu claims third victim in turkey officials confirmed three children from the same family have died from bird flu in eastern turkey , marking a major shift westwards to the edge of europe of a disease that has so far claimed lives in eastern asia .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "
unavailable under communism but the girl 's parents would have been unlikely to come across cannabis , or any other illegal drugs in communist czechoslovakia , said former dissident josef rauvolf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the czechs ' drug of choice - along with alcohol " of course people knew about cannabis , but they mostly just knew about it , " rauvolf recalled .
" some lucky ones had access to either homegrown or smuggled -lrb- marijuana -rrb- - well , mostly homegrown because smuggling could get you two years in prison at least .
the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .
if you had it in your garden nobody could call the police , because they did n't know what it was . "
the situation has changed immensely since the velvet revolution , said rauvolf .
and not just among the younger generation .
" the attitude to marijuana is quite liberal , even among just normal , average people .
people in small villages smoke it , and they do n't take it as something special .
they are just having a few beers , so they have a few joints .
it 's not like it used to be - intellectuals or the underground , so-called counterculture .
no , it 's normal people , people driving tractors or whatever . "
pleasure principle but how has cannabis become such a normal part of life for czechs ?
" we can take it optimistically : that we are an open society and our youngsters are good enough and free enough to speak about it , " explained the founder of prague 's dropin drug clinic , ivan douda . douda said that the development may also have positive side .
" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .
pragmatic approach the legal situation in the czech republic is somewhat confusing : possession of an undefined " amount not bigger than a small amount " is considered only a misdemeanor .
douda praised a new bill currently before the czech parliament that should make things more clear .
" we will have some stratification , some drug categories , and marijuana will be on the low level , " he said . ian willoughby -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech republic is eu cannabis capital less than two years into its eu membership , the czech republic has already gained notoriety as the european frontrunner when it comes to beer drinking and dope smoking .

" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "
unavailable under communism but the girl 's parents would have been unlikely to come across cannabis , or any other illegal drugs in communist czechoslovakia , said former dissident josef rauvolf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the czechs ' drug of choice - along with alcohol " of course people knew about cannabis , but they mostly just knew about it , " rauvolf recalled .
" some lucky ones had access to either homegrown or smuggled -lrb- marijuana -rrb- - well , mostly homegrown because smuggling could get you two years in prison at least .
the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .
if you had it in your garden nobody could call the police , because they did n't know what it was . "
the situation has changed immensely since the velvet revolution , said rauvolf .
and not just among the younger generation .
" the attitude to marijuana is quite liberal , even among just normal , average people .
people in small villages smoke it , and they do n't take it as something special .
they are just having a few beers , so they have a few joints .
it 's not like it used to be - intellectuals or the underground , so-called counterculture .
no , it 's normal people , people driving tractors or whatever . "
pleasure principle but how has cannabis become such a normal part of life for czechs ?
" we can take it optimistically : that we are an open society and our youngsters are good enough and free enough to speak about it , " explained the founder of prague 's dropin drug clinic , ivan douda . douda said that the development may also have positive side .
" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .
pragmatic approach the legal situation in the czech republic is somewhat confusing : possession of an undefined " amount not bigger than a small amount " is considered only a misdemeanor .
douda praised a new bill currently before the czech parliament that should make things more clear .
" we will have some stratification , some drug categories , and marijuana will be on the low level , " he said . ian willoughby -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech republic is eu cannabis capital less than two years into its eu membership , the czech republic has already gained notoriety as the european frontrunner when it comes to beer drinking and dope smoking .

" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .
we will go all the way because we saw during the confederation cup that we are getting the balance of the team right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , trying to convince bastian schweinsteiger he can win the cup but klinsmann 's certainty does n't seem to be trickling down through the germany roster to the fans .
excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .
the former international striker and world champion has been the subject of heavy criticism over his decision to continue to live in the united states , his indecision over which goalkeeper to select and his tactical philosophy .
but klinsmann insists everything is right on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican mystic said a german win is in the cards " we are sure we are on course and we will use the next few months to fine tune things , " he said .
" we will then be very difficult to beat . "
klinsmann , and germany fans , should not doubt the host team , according to tarot card reader antonio vazquez , mexico 's self-proclaimed " grand warlock . "
" i see germany and nothing more , " he told reporters in mexico city .

recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .

merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .
experts reckon that well over a billion euros would be required - money that neither the state of berlin nor private organizations are able to raise . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic .

they regularly patrol during political summits and were also present at the 2004 athens olympics and pope benedict xvi 's world youth day visit to cologne last summer . the interior ministry requested that nato provide surveillance planes to prevent private aircraft from overflying the stadiums , a spokesman told the ap news agency on the condition of anonymity . run by germany and 11 other nations , the 17-plane awacs fleet has its closest base near the western german city of aachen , meaning the pilots wo n't have a long commute to work during the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . no tanks in front of stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble while politicians in berlin do not have a problem with the security planes making the rounds well out of sight above the stadiums , there is quite a bit of opposition to plans to have the german military on hand at the stadiums . schäule -lrb- photo -rrb- has said he fears police forces could be overwhelmed by the tournament 's security issues .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .
the condition of a fourth sibling , a six-year-old boy , was reportedly improving . it is thought that the bad winter conditions in the area forced the family to bring their infected poultry flock into the home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics and family members carry the coffin of mehmet kocyigit .
the kocyigit siblings and most of the other patients in van were from the remote town of dogubeyazit , less then 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the town of aralik , at the armenian border , which was quarantined last week after poultry tested positive for bird flu . as veterinary experts culled fowl and disinfected the areas , agriculture minister mehdi eker announced friday that bird flu has been found in two wild ducks near the capital ankara , nearly 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 700 miles -rrb- west of the infected area . the discovery raised fears that migratory birds may be spreading the disease across the vast country , as experts had warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu claims third victim in turkey officials confirmed three children from the same family have died from bird flu in eastern turkey , marking a major shift westwards to the edge of europe of a disease that has so far claimed lives in eastern asia .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .
their sister hulya , 11 , succumbed friday after several days in intensive care .
the condition of a fourth sibling , a six-year-old boy , was reportedly improving . it is thought that the bad winter conditions in the area forced the family to bring their infected poultry flock into the home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medics and family members carry the coffin of mehmet kocyigit .
the kocyigit siblings and most of the other patients in van were from the remote town of dogubeyazit , less then 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the town of aralik , at the armenian border , which was quarantined last week after poultry tested positive for bird flu . as veterinary experts culled fowl and disinfected the areas , agriculture minister mehdi eker announced friday that bird flu has been found in two wild ducks near the capital ankara , nearly 1,000 kilometers -lrb- 700 miles -rrb- west of the infected area . the discovery raised fears that migratory birds may be spreading the disease across the vast country , as experts had warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu claims third victim in turkey officials confirmed three children from the same family have died from bird flu in eastern turkey , marking a major shift westwards to the edge of europe of a disease that has so far claimed lives in eastern asia .

they regularly patrol during political summits and were also present at the 2004 athens olympics and pope benedict xvi 's world youth day visit to cologne last summer . the interior ministry requested that nato provide surveillance planes to prevent private aircraft from overflying the stadiums , a spokesman told the ap news agency on the condition of anonymity . run by germany and 11 other nations , the 17-plane awacs fleet has its closest base near the western german city of aachen , meaning the pilots wo n't have a long commute to work during the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . no tanks in front of stadiums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble while politicians in berlin do not have a problem with the security planes making the rounds well out of sight above the stadiums , there is quite a bit of opposition to plans to have the german military on hand at the stadiums . schäule -lrb- photo -rrb- has said he fears police forces could be overwhelmed by the tournament 's security issues .

fans without tickets who watch the matches at bars and public viewing events - and who wo n't be subject to stadium security checks and alcohol-free beer - then meet later on the street have police worried more than what may happen in the stands . jürgen mathies , head of the world cup 's police deployment working group , told the newspaper he was confident police vacation bans would ensure safety during the tournament .

" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .
we will go all the way because we saw during the confederation cup that we are getting the balance of the team right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , trying to convince bastian schweinsteiger he can win the cup but klinsmann 's certainty does n't seem to be trickling down through the germany roster to the fans .
excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation . " there is no suspicion at the moment over a possible human-to-human transmission , " akdag said at ankara airport , from where the group was to fly out to van , anatolia news agency reported . fear of human-to-human contagion raises pandemic concerns currently , humans are thought only to contract bird flu if they come into close contact with infected birds , but scientists fear that millions around the world could die if the virus crosses with human flu strains to become highly contagious . the deaths in turkey , the first known human fatalities outside southeast asia and china , brought the threat of a pandemic to europe 's doorstep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish authorities are battling to contain the outbreak - and the ensuing panic .
a who spokeswoman said friday that experts from the organization would help turkish officials take the right measures to prevent any spread .
" the initial hypothesis we are working on is that the children affected had dealt with diseased chickens and were thus infected , " fadela chaib said . but the experts " will also try to see if we are faced with the first case of human-to-human transmission , which would be the start of a flu epidemic , " she added . h5n1 strain rife in affected area , health officials claim tests done in turkey and confirmed by a laboratory in britain established that two of the victims carried the lethal h5n1 virus , a senior health ministry official said friday . he said one of the dead children 's results had been negative , but did not specify which one , and that a third person who tested positive was being treated in a hospital in van . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was confirmed in at least one patient being treated in van .
apart from the one patient confirmed to be carrying h5n1 , 19 others , mostly children , have been hospitalized in van on suspicion of carrying the disease . akdag said that despite several suspicious cases in other parts of the country , " there are no probable or highly probable -lrb- human -rrb- cases in turkey other than the patients in van . " the sub-type h5n1 is the strain responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people in southeast asia and china since 2003 , nearly 40 of whom succumbed last year alone . three siblings die after weather forced birds to be housed in home the first of the turkish victims , mehmet kocyigit , 14 , died sunday , followed five days later by his 15-year-old sister fatma .

different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners . " the tone of her comments shows that while she has maintained that repairing the damaged transatlantic relationship is a priority of her foreign affairs agenda , the chancellor will not be shying away from speaking out on issues where disagreement exists . repairing damaged a relations a priority but not at any cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush met from time to time but only when protocol demanded .
relations between germany and the united states reached a post-war unprecedented low during the chancellorship of merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder who adopted a strong anti-war stance on the issue of iraq to win the 2002 general election .
consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .
the chancellor , who will meet with george w. bush on friday , said that she intends to talk to president about the fight against terrorism .
" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .

the news comes after who experts arrived in the affected region to assess the threat . the two new confirmed cases of bird flu in turkey are children , like the two siblings who died from the disease over the past week , their doctor said sunday .
the two , hospitalized in the eastern city of van , are a five-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl , chief physician huseyin avni sahin told afp .
sahin said the hospital had been informed about the results of tests done at laboratories in turkey and britain confirming that the children carried the h5n1 strain of avian influenza , which may be lethal to humans .
" what is encouraging is that their condition has improved and they are currently well , " he said .
three children from the same family , aged between 11 and 15 , died in the same hospital in van over the past week after coming in close contact with sick chicken .
two of them have been confirmed to have contracted the h5n1 virus , while the definite cause of the death of the third is not yet known .
they are the first confirmed human fatalities from h5n1 outside southeast asia and china , where the disease has killed more than 70 people since 2003 .
a fourth sibling , aged six , was reported in good condition , and doctors said the boy may be soon discharged . world health organization experts were in turkey saturday to look for any signs of much-feared human-to-human transmission of bird flu after the first deaths from the disease outside east asia were confirmed in the east of the country . the experts were to visit the hospital in van city where three siblings from the same family died after coming in close contact with sick chickens , and review the situation in dogubeyazit town , where the children lived , said health minister recep akdag , who was accompanying the delegation .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "

" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .
in a cellar bar a stone 's throw from prague 's charles bridge , there 's a mostly young crowd .
the beer and wine are flowing , and every once in a while somebody passes around a joint .
" a couple of years ago it used to be like , i 'm cool i 'm smoking marijuana - nowadays it 's just normal , " said one girl .
" here they are pretty used to people smoking on the street so i 'm not hiding .
the attitude is very open-minded .
even my parents , from the older generation , they do n't take it as a real danger or anything . "
unavailable under communism but the girl 's parents would have been unlikely to come across cannabis , or any other illegal drugs in communist czechoslovakia , said former dissident josef rauvolf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the czechs ' drug of choice - along with alcohol " of course people knew about cannabis , but they mostly just knew about it , " rauvolf recalled .
" some lucky ones had access to either homegrown or smuggled -lrb- marijuana -rrb- - well , mostly homegrown because smuggling could get you two years in prison at least .
the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .
if you had it in your garden nobody could call the police , because they did n't know what it was . "
the situation has changed immensely since the velvet revolution , said rauvolf .
and not just among the younger generation .
" the attitude to marijuana is quite liberal , even among just normal , average people .
people in small villages smoke it , and they do n't take it as something special .
they are just having a few beers , so they have a few joints .
it 's not like it used to be - intellectuals or the underground , so-called counterculture .
no , it 's normal people , people driving tractors or whatever . "

" we can take it optimistically : that we are an open society and our youngsters are good enough and free enough to speak about it , " explained the founder of prague 's dropin drug clinic , ivan douda . douda said that the development may also have positive side .
" if there are fewer hard drugs and more so-called soft drugs it 's good news . "
some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .
" maybe it 's something about the national character that we prefer to smoke marijuana , because it 's a drug of smiling , of music , of eating and other very pleasant things , " dr. douda said , adding that cannabis is not all about smiling and can lead to problems similar to alcoholism .
pragmatic approach the legal situation in the czech republic is somewhat confusing : possession of an undefined " amount not bigger than a small amount " is considered only a misdemeanor .
douda praised a new bill currently before the czech parliament that should make things more clear .

" yes , i have a kalashnikov and it 's illegal , but every time they take one of them , i find another one , " said bosnian serb pajo , who has already had three of the assault rifles confiscated on different occasions . " in this region having a weapon means having security , because this is a kind of place where you always have to fear other people , " said sociologist ivan sijakovic , explaining why bosnians want to hang on to their weapons despite 10 years of internationally monitored peace in the former yugoslav republic . " people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet .

" people 's attachment to their guns here comes from the belief that if they rid themselves of their weapons , they will be attacked again and will not be able to defend themselves , " he added . the war of the early 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives and left about 2.2 million people homeless was the latest of centuries of conflicts in bosnia , where people have learned to expect wars to break out every 50 years or so . " there are illegally held weapons throughout the world but i think that the balkans , as a result of its recent history , has more weapons in the general community than many other parts of europe , " british brigadier mark elcomb , the commander of eu peacekeepers in northern bosnia , told afp . most of the weapons , some of which date back to world war ii , were not handed over despite an existing amnesty for people who choose to give them up to authorities . huge numbers of weapons uncovered but many remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of weapons have been recovered ; just as many remain hidden .
since 1998 , peacekeepers have collected about 52,000 small arms , 38,500 land mines , over 225,000 hand grenades , about 15.5 million rounds of ammunition , 33,000 kilograms -lrb- 72,750 pounds -rrb- of explosives , over 60,000 other military items such as mortars - and even a couple of tanks . but according to research by the united nations development program last year , this is only the tip of the iceberg . bosnia 's serb , muslim and croat communities still hold a huge arsenal of weapons , both legal and illegal , the undp study found .
bosnia 's population of about 3.8 million possesses 353,000 legally registered weapons , mostly pistols and hunting rifles , but rough estimates say civilians possess another 500,000 illegal weapons originating from the last war . there had even been calls on authorities to permit the ownership of weapons meant for warfare , with some people saying they were disappointed to find that machine guns and other heavy weapons can not be legalized . experience hinders efforts to form a lasting peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region is unlikely to forget its brutal past in a hurry .
despite the conviction in the international community that bosnia 's peace is sustainable , it seems that hundreds of thousands of locals still cling to the old communist saying : " live as if we will have peace for the next 100 years , but be ready as if tomorrow we will have to fight a war . " " i am afraid that a majority of people still believe that previous wars have only calmed down temporarily and that they did not end yet , meaning that there will be more occasions of getting even and revenge , " said sijakovic . " the 20th century witnessed three huge conflicts here , of which the latest left the bloodiest trail , and i am afraid that bosnian politicians are not doing anything to help people reconcile .
on the contrary , " said military analyst ostoja barasin . during world wars i and ii , former yugoslavia including its ex-republic of bosnia-herzegovina suffered greatly , with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives . the legacy of these and earlier wars in the balkans was often blamed for the inter-ethnic hatred that erupted in the 1990s . " communities were badly hurt ... by the -lrb- most recent -rrb- war and it takes a long time to rebuild trust ... there would be a desire on the part of individuals to provide a degree of protection for the family , " brigadier elcomb said .
" but , at some stage trust -lrb- between bosnian serbs , muslims and croats -rrb- must exist , " he added . for the military analyst barasin , however , the future is not so clear : " i fear that the process of reconciliation has not even started yet .

" i am convinced that it will be a tremendous world cup , " klinsmann told germany 's bild newspaper .
" we have already booked our hotel rooms in berlin .
we will go all the way because we saw during the confederation cup that we are getting the balance of the team right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , trying to convince bastian schweinsteiger he can win the cup but klinsmann 's certainty does n't seem to be trickling down through the germany roster to the fans .
excitement begins to wane as pollsters questions move from coach to player to fan .
while klinsmann sounds positive , oliver kahn , one of the national team 's two goalkeepers , said it 's possible germany win the title in front of a home crowd .
" in the national team you sense that such a goal is doable , " he told dw-world , before adding that it 's possible for any team to win .
" the enthusiasm of 80 million germans is a very important factor . "
fans less optimistic than tarot card reader kahn and the rest of the german team have reason to question just how enthusiastic their fans really are .
before the germans ' opening game on june 9 in munich , only 39 percent of them think their side has what it takes to be crowned champions .
any lack of fan confidence could be attributed to how little germans really see of their national team coach .
the former international striker and world champion has been the subject of heavy criticism over his decision to continue to live in the united states , his indecision over which goalkeeper to select and his tactical philosophy .
but klinsmann insists everything is right on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican mystic said a german win is in the cards " we are sure we are on course and we will use the next few months to fine tune things , " he said .
" we will then be very difficult to beat . "
klinsmann , and germany fans , should not doubt the host team , according to tarot card reader antonio vazquez , mexico 's self-proclaimed " grand warlock . "
" i see germany and nothing more , " he told reporters in mexico city .
then again , fans may have reason to question the prediction - vazquez foresaw a european winner at the 2002 tournament . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oliver kahn : germany can win the soccer world cup some revere oliver kahn as a gift to german soccer , others see him as arrogant and smug .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .
experts reckon that well over a billion euros would be required - money that neither the state of berlin nor private organizations are able to raise . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german architecture 's second chance a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .

different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners . " the tone of her comments shows that while she has maintained that repairing the damaged transatlantic relationship is a priority of her foreign affairs agenda , the chancellor will not be shying away from speaking out on issues where disagreement exists . repairing damaged a relations a priority but not at any cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush met from time to time but only when protocol demanded .
relations between germany and the united states reached a post-war unprecedented low during the chancellorship of merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder who adopted a strong anti-war stance on the issue of iraq to win the 2002 general election .
consequent battles of will over the us-led invasion dragged the two countries into an acrimonious spat which lasted for most of schröder 's prematurely ended second term . merkel 's comments also reflect a widespread skepticism in germany about the way the us is fighting its " war on terror . "
recent scandals centered on the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " strategy - which had particular resonance in germany due to the abduction and detention of german citizen khaled el masri - and alleged secret prisons in europe have injected further unease . there has also been a long-standing opposition in germany to the use of the guantanamo bay detention centre in cuba from human rights activists and many figures in the german government . friendship to be accentuated with us but not russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel have not met since she became chancellor .
the chancellor , who will meet with george w. bush on friday , said that she intends to talk to president about the fight against terrorism .
" but i want to accentuate that our relationship with the us will not be reduced to talking about fighting terrorism and the iraq war , " she added .
she also referred to the relationship between the two countries as a friendship . the same courtesy was not afforded to russia however .
merkel , calling germany 's relationship with moscow a " strategic partnership " , said that germany 's relationship with russia was not as strong as that with the us . " i do n't think we share as many of the same values yet with russia as we do with the united states , " she said .
" but we have a huge interest in seeing russia develop in a sensible way . " while the opposition leader , merkel often criticized the then-chancellor schröder for forging " exclusive " ties with russia at the expense of relations with smaller eu countries . chancellor to address concerns on russia development to putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next meeting may not be so cordial as merkel intends to raise concerns .
merkel will meet president vladimir putin in moscow days after her washington trip and will hope to discuss her concerns over issues such as the new law giving the kremlin more control over non-governmental organizations and the recent row between ukraine and russia over gas prices . the short but hard-hitting " gas war " made germans question their own heavy reliance on russia for gas , she said .
" we need to do everything to save as much energy as possible and diversify our sources , " she said , adding that germany would avoid letting russia be its only supplier . the european union , which imports a quarter of its gas from russia , was hit after russian gas monopoly gazprom cut deliveries to ukraine on jan .

marijuana seems to have become accepted as a normal part of life in the czech republic . a recent report by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction found that of czechs aged 16 to 34 , 22 percent said they had smoked cannabis in the previous year , more than in any other eu country .

some czechs say there 's a connection between their countrymen and women 's passion for beer and their illegal drug consumption , that they use alcohol and drugs to help them relax .

pragmatic approach the legal situation in the czech republic is somewhat confusing : possession of an undefined " amount not bigger than a small amount " is considered only a misdemeanor .

the lucky ones , they had it , but the quality was very poor .

berlin 's city authorities have announced that demolition of communist east germany 's so-called palace of the republic in the heart of the city will begin shortly , despite continuing opposition . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , said friday that , if all goes well , demolition of the building would cost 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- - much less than the 20 million euros expected .
the work is set to begin in mid-january and be completed by easter 2007 .
the modern and multifunctional building housed east germany 's rubber-stamp parliament until german unification in 1990 , but was also a posh cultural center for ordinary people .
for many berliners , the decision to pull down the building is an extremely emotive issue . the demolition was decided on long ago for two main reasons .
to start with , the building was contaminated with asbestos .
in addition , plans arose to rebuild a replica of the 18th century royal palace that once stood in the same place , but was blown up in 1950 by communist rulers who saw in it a symbol of prussia 's military past .
communist vs. royalist symbol berlin 's social democratic mayor , klaus wowereit , has made no secret of the fact that he 's all in favor of the forthcoming destruction of the palace of the republic .
while most western berliners are indifferent about what will happen , eastern berliners - particularly older ones - think that pulling down the building is outrageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building has been used for cultural events since the asbestos was cleared out " it was so beautiful inside , " said one woman .
" in spring for instance there was this huge carpet of flowers in the entry hall which made you feel you were in the middle of a dream .
it really was a sight for sore eyes . " her husband agreed .
the building , which visitors used to call state leader erich honecker 's lamp shop because of the numerous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings , should have been preserved as a part of germany 's history , he said . " politicians should really have more respect for those eastern germans who put all their skills and expertise into constructing this unique facility , " he said . " all we hear is that it was former state leader erich honecker 's project .
maybe , but that does n't justify tearing down the building .
it cast such a spell on ordinary people and really was a perfect place to have a good time , complete with a bowling center , fantastic concert halls , bars and the like .
nobody claims that honecker was a good guy , but the prussian king who had the former royal palace built was n't such a do-gooder either . he sent so many people to their deaths in various imperial wars .
so why should anyone want to reconstruct the royal palace ? "
no money for new building many politicians , historians , architects and ordinary berliners want to do exactly that .
they back a plan to fill the vacuum the demolished palace leaves with a reconstruction of the original facade of the hohenzollern royal palace .
the interior of the new building would be made accessible to the general public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is how the rebuilt royal palace could look london-based architect peter wilson said that creating an exact replica of the castle would neither be feasible nor make any sense .
" it 's not a realistic possibility , " said wilson .
" i think one should not build a plastic disneyland version .
many of us have proposed to use some of the geometries of the old palace , to use the shape , but to do a contemporary building . " but while demolition of the palace of the republic seems unavoidable , despite ongoing protests , rebuilding the royal palace in whatever shape still seems light years away .

the bodies , which are both male and have been dated to more than 2,000 years old , probably belong to the victims of a ritual sacrifice .
in common with other bog bodies , they show signs of having been tortured before their deaths .
details of the finds are outlined in a bbc timewatch documentary to be screened on 20 january . "
my belief is that these burials are offerings to the gods of fertility by kings to ensure a successful reign " ned kelly , national museum of ireland the first body dropped off a peat cutting machine in february 2003 in clonycavan , near dublin .
the forearms , hands and lower abdomen are missing , believed to have been hacked off by the machine .
the second was found in may the same year in croghan , just 25 miles -lrb- 40km -rrb- from clonycavan .
old croghan man , as it has become known , was missing a head and lower limbs .
it was discovered by workmen clearing a drainage ditch through a peat bog .
tanned skin although the police were initially called in , an inspection by the state pathologist confirmed that this was an archaeological case .
both bodies were subsequently taken to the national museum of ireland in dublin .
a team of experts from the uk and ireland has been examining the bodies to learn how they lived and died .
radiocarbon dating , for example , would show that both had died at similar times - around 2,300 years ago .
one of the experts is don brothwell , the york university archaeologist who led the scientific investigation of lindow man , the bog body found in cheshire in 1984 .
hundreds of bodies have been recovered from peat wetlands across northern europe .
the earliest accounts date back to the 18th century .
the unique chemistry of peat bogs essentially mummifies bodies .
summer death the peat-building sphagnum moss embeds remains in cold , acid and oxygen-free conditions that immobilise bacteria .
" the way peat wetlands preserve bodies has been described as a process of ' slow-cooking ' which tans them dark brown , " timewatch producer john hayes-fisher told the bbc news website .
clonycavan man was a young male no more than 5ft 2in tall -lrb- 1.6m -rrb- .
beneath his hair , which retains its unusual " raised " style , was a massive wound caused by heavy cutting object that smashed open his skull .
chemical analysis of the hair showed that clonycavan man 's diet was rich in vegetables in the months leading up to his death , suggesting he died in summer .
it also revealed that he had been using a type of iron age hair gel ; a vegetable plant oil mixed with a resin that had probably come from south-western france or spain .
dismembered body old croghan man was also young - probably in his early to mid 20s - but much taller than his counterpart from 25 miles away .
scientists worked out from the length of his arms that he would have stood around 6ft 6in tall -lrb- 2.0m -rrb- .
he had been horrifically tortured before death .
his nipples had been cut and he had been stabbed in the ribs .
a cut on his arm suggested he had tried to defend himself during the attack that ended his life .
the young man was later beheaded and dismembered .
hazel ropes were passed through his arms before he was buried in the bog .
food remains in his stomach show that old croghan man had eaten milk and cereals before he died .
but chemical analysis of his nails showed that he had more meat in his diet than clonycavan man .
this suggests that he died in a colder season than clonycavan man , when vegetables were more scarce .
it may also explain why his remains are better preserved .
hopeful offering the researchers used digital technology to reconstruct the distorted face of clonycavan man .
from his studies on these bog bodies and others , ned kelly , keeper of irish antiquities at the national museum of ireland , has developed a new theory which explains why so many remains are buried on important political or royal boundaries .

this could dismiss claims charon is a planet twinned with pluto and provide further insight into their formation .
two groups of scientists made observations of the moon as it eclipsed a distant star in the july of 2005 .
the size of any atmosphere around charon was figured out by observing how gradually the star disappeared and reappeared during the eclipse .
when charon passed in front of a star - in an occultation event - astronomers knew it would either cut the light off gradually or very quickly .
if the moon had no atmosphere then the light would be cut off sharply .
however an atmosphere would cause a gradual cut off .
in south america , two groups , headed by amanda gulbis and bruno sicardy , were watching through some of the world 's largest telescopes .
in reports published in nature , they both agreed charon had little or no atmosphere , with any atmosphere present being thinner than on pluto or even on our moon .
similar observations were made 25 years ago and it left some astronomers thinking it might have a thin atmosphere .
coupled with charon being over half the size of pluto , there was an argument for charon being classified as a planet .
january launch the new observation could settle the debate over pluto and charon being twinned planets .
the two teams also made a more accurate measurement of charon 's size , with a radius between 603 and 606km -lrb- 375 and 377 miles -rrb- .
combining this with data from the hubble telescope , the research groups concluded just over half of charon is rock .
the long wait between occultations illustrates the difficulties in exploring the far reaches of the solar system .
for example , little is understood about how pluto and charon were formed .
it is unknown whether they formed together or if pluto captured charon from the kuiper belt , the vast region containing icy objects beyond neptune 's orbit .
pluto and its moon are also the target of a us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- mission .
the new horizons spacecraft is expected to be launched in their direction on 17 january .

two groups of scientists made observations of the moon as it eclipsed a distant star in the july of 2005 .
the size of any atmosphere around charon was figured out by observing how gradually the star disappeared and reappeared during the eclipse .
when charon passed in front of a star - in an occultation event - astronomers knew it would either cut the light off gradually or very quickly .
if the moon had no atmosphere then the light would be cut off sharply .
however an atmosphere would cause a gradual cut off .
in south america , two groups , headed by amanda gulbis and bruno sicardy , were watching through some of the world 's largest telescopes .
in reports published in nature , they both agreed charon had little or no atmosphere , with any atmosphere present being thinner than on pluto or even on our moon .
similar observations were made 25 years ago and it left some astronomers thinking it might have a thin atmosphere .
coupled with charon being over half the size of pluto , there was an argument for charon being classified as a planet .
january launch the new observation could settle the debate over pluto and charon being twinned planets .
the two teams also made a more accurate measurement of charon 's size , with a radius between 603 and 606km -lrb- 375 and 377 miles -rrb- .
combining this with data from the hubble telescope , the research groups concluded just over half of charon is rock .
the long wait between occultations illustrates the difficulties in exploring the far reaches of the solar system .
for example , little is understood about how pluto and charon were formed .
it is unknown whether they formed together or if pluto captured charon from the kuiper belt , the vast region containing icy objects beyond neptune 's orbit .
pluto and its moon are also the target of a us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- mission .
the new horizons spacecraft is expected to be launched in their direction on 17 january .

a series of avalanches has fallen across the european alps this week , killing at least 10 skiers and leaving many others buried in the snow .
seven people have been killed in france and three in germany .
it follows the deaths of 15 people in the ice rink disaster in the german town of bad reichenhall last monday .
two people in austria have frozen to death in the coldest spell of the winter .
the snow has brought chaos to large parts of the european alps , with roads and railways blocked and tens of thousands of people without electricity in parts of austria and germany .
death on the slopes in courchevel , a resort popular with british skiers , an american was killed when an avalanche caught him in full view of people on a nearby chairlift .
the avalanche risk has been very high and yet still people go off piste without the right equipment and training betony garner ski club of great britain despite efforts to find him he was buried for 20 minutes before rescue services found his body .
people have a 90 % survival rate if found within the first 15 minutes , then the chance of living falls sharply .
in tignes , another resort favoured by the british , four people were avalanched but managed to dig themselves out , while nearby a father and son were buried under a metre of snow for 10 minutes but other skiers who saw the incident rescued them in time .
at christmas a british medical student , rafe hattaway , died in the neighbouring resort of val d 'isere while snowboarding with his brother .
all the deaths involved people skiing outside the marked runs and in one fatal incident in the savoie region this week a skier fell 80 metres over a cliff after he and three friends climbed over a safety barrier that had been built to prevent skiers going into the area .
the three survivors are now being questioned by police .
the reason people ski in these areas is to find untracked fresh snow but many simply do not understand the dangers .
safety measures " it is amazing how stupid some skiers and snowboarders are , " says betony garner from the ski club of great britain .
" the avalanche risk has been very high and yet still people go off piste without the right equipment and training . "
the ski club advises everyone who goes off piste to have an avalanche transceiver , a shovel and a probe .
the transceiver sends out a signal that helps the victim to be found underneath the snow .
relief as snow hits resorts " it was cold last week and it snowed a lot , then warmed up and continued snowing , " said michael staudinger , the head of the avalanche warning service in salzburg , austria .
" this raised the snow 's density and hence its weight . "
slushy snow weighs three times more than powder snow .
this weight has brought down power lines and trees leaving 12,000 people without electricity in germany and 18,000 in austria .
the zell valley has snow throughout the region with snowdrifts blocking roads and railway lines .
" many thousands of our holiday makers had their journeys disrupted by the weather , " katie joly , the manager for crystal holidays in france and switzerland , told the bbc news website .
" some flights had to be cancelled and others delayed but fortunately all our clients eventually completed their journey . "
optimistic outlook despite the tragedies , the conditions have brought the best snow conditions seen by skiers over the new year for many seasons .
austria and germany have the best of the snow with some of the lesser known resorts in switzerland like engleberg and wengen doing well .
" if you ski safely and in the right places then the conditions really are quite fantastic , " says jane hartley from the british travel agent , erna low .
" there is now a good base and with the cold weather preserving the snow europe could have a bumper season ahead . "

under mr kennedy 's guidance the perennial also-rans of british politics started to look like real contenders - even if his talk of " genuine three party politics " may have sounded a bit like wishful thinking at times .
when mr kennedy took over in 1999 the party was on a high , having achieved a breakthrough at the 1997 general election under previous leader paddy ashdown , electing 46 mps .
mr kennedy was able to build on that success , making impressive gains in local government and gaining the party a real taste of power in scotland , where they govern in coalition with labour .
at last year 's general election , the party saw 62 mps elected - its highest tally since the 1920s .
laid-back and he did it the hard way - abandoning his predecessor lord ashdown 's dream of a permanent alliance with labour , in favour of steady incremental progress at the ballot box .
mr kennedy married sarah gurling in 2002 his down-to-earth , blokeish image honed by appearances on television programmes such as have i got news for you , arguably helped the lib dems appeal to voters turned off by traditional westminster politics .
he took pride in being described in newspaper profiles as a " fully paid-up member of the human race " .

when they elected mr kennedy , the lib dems knew they had chosen a " bon viveur " over rivals with more gravitas but less charisma .
it was suggested in 1994 that he failed to take politics seriously when he won £ 2,000 from a £ 50 flutter waging that the lib dems would take only two seats in the european elections .
and at the start of his leadership mr kennedy was dubbed " inaction man " compared to his ex-marine predecessor lord ashdown .
in a westminster village that thrives on drama and confrontation , his laid-back , consensual style was sometimes been interpreted as laziness .
his father ian once said his son 's attitude at school was : " do enough to get by without knocking your pan in . "
and mr kennedy 's dramatic admission - after years of denials - that he has been treated for a drink problem , only confirmed the worst fears of his detractors .
early start mr kennedy was born in inverness and educated at lochaber high school and glasgow university .
apart from a brief time as a journalist with bbc highland , he has been an mp since the tender of age 23 .
the young kennedy had taken a break from his postgraduate studies at indiana university in the united states in 1983 to contest the ross , cromarty & skye seat , the uk 's largest constituency , which he did not think he had a chance of winning .
he even flew back to the us as the polls closed .
but standing for the sdp led by roy jenkins and the gang of four , he unseated government minister hamish gray and - despite his youth and lack of political experience - was being tipped for the top almost from the moment he entered the commons .
at first he was sdp spokesman on social security , scotland and health and when most of his party merged with the liberals to form the lib dems in 1988 , he continued to hold a series of frontbench posts , while building his profile with regular television appearances , leading some to dub him " chatshow charlie " .
he beat five candidates , including current party president simon hughes , to the leadership in 1999 and set about uncoupling it - at a national level - from labour .
soul-searching at a time when the gap between the two main parties is narrowing , mr kennedy has been able to develop a set of policies - on europe , civil liberties , the environment , tax and the iraq war - that set it apart .
the 2001 election saw the party increase its share of the vote to 18.1 % and have 52 mps elected .
in 2003 , mr kennedy took the decision - after much soul-searching - to oppose the us-led invasion of iraq .
he spoke at an anti-war rally in london 's hyde park , but backed british troops once the invasion was under way - a move which led to criticism from some peace activists .
by now mr kennedy was a married man , and he became a father for the first time during the 2005 election campaign , when his wife sarah gurling gave him a baby son , donald james .
ill-health he blamed the resulting lack of sleep for a stuttering performance during press conference questions on tax .
but rumours about the 46-year-old 's health and lifestyle proved harder to shrug-off , despite him vowing publicly to take more exercise , drink less alcohol and stop smoking .
he appeared ill during his speech at the lib dems ' spring conference last year but this was put down to a stomach bug .
he also missed gordon brown 's budget speech due to " a bout of ill health " .
following his confession that he had a drink problem it was reported that four top party figures cornered mr kennedy in his private office in 2004 and insisted he acknowledged his drink problem .
according to itv news , they succeeded in persuading him to admit his condition and he has since been receiving " private " medical help .
many of his frontbench colleagues expected him to step down after the 2005 election - his refusal to do so prompting a whispering campaign that would eventually lead to his downfall .
mr kennedy fought the 2005 general election as the " real alternative " to labour , claiming his party was poised to overtake the conservatives as the main party of opposition , as a prelude to a lunge for number 10 .
its most eye-catching policy - apart from its continued opposition to the iraq war - was a local income tax and a 50p tax rate for people earning more than £ 100,000 a year -lrb- the latter policy has since been dropped -rrb- .
it also wanted to drop student tuition fees and give free long-term personal care to the elderly , a policy it had pioneered in scotland .
future but the party drew charges of opportunism by targeting conservative voters in tory areas and labour voters in labour areas .
its much-vaunted " decapitation strategy " - aimed at unseating a string of high profile conservatives - also failed to come off .
and despite gaining a record number of seats , mr kennedy 's critics began to complain that it could - and should - have done better .
mr kennedy launched a debate about the future of the party at its annual conference in blackpool - but the event was overshadowed by whispering about his leadership .
that whispering has escalated in recent weeks , with senior party figures breaking ranks to call for his removal .
he might have survived if itv news had not confronted him with evidence of his drink problem , which had been handed to them by senior lib dems .
mr kennedy 's subsequent dramatic admission of a battle with alcohol was the final throw of the dice - an appeal over the heads of his mps to the party membership .
but his mps could take no more and more than half of them said they would no longer work with him if he was re-elected as leader , leaving him little choice but to resign .

lib dem leader charles kennedy is coming under mounting pressure to resign after admitting he has been struggling with a drink problem .
so what happens next ?
what kind of pressure is charles kennedy under ?
he is faced with a mass walk-out of frontbenchers if he does not quit by monday .
twenty-five mps , including eight of his shadow cabinet , have signed a statement saying they are no longer prepared to serve him .
is he going to go ?
mr kennedy 's spokesman says he will not resign " in any shape or form " this weekend .
the lib dem leader himself has said it would be a " dereliction of duty " to walk away from his job and claims to have " overwhelming support " among ordinary party members .
what happens now ?
senior mps and peers will continue to pile on the pressure for him to quit and if he fails to go are likely to call a confidence vote when parliament returns next week to try to change his mind .
what is the point of a confidence vote ?
mr kennedy has already called a leadership election so a confidence vote is not needed to force a contest .
but critical mps think it could still be a way of spelling out to their leader that he just can not continue .
even if he lost a confidence vote , mr kennedy could still be a candidate in the leadership contest .
what has happened to the leadership contest ?
the lib dem federal executive will meet in the next few days to start formally arranging the contest requested by mr kennedy .
who will stand ?
mr kennedy says he will stand but so far no other candidates have come forward .
sir menzies campbell , previously favourite to take over , and home affairs spokesman mark oaten both say they will not stand against mr kennedy .
party president simon hughes has yet to announce his intentions .
so the only name on the ballot paper could be mr kennedy 's ?
it could be - and if that happens he would be automatically re-elected as leader .
how would a leadership election work ?
there would be a secret ballot of all lib dem members - about 70,000 people - using the single transferable vote system where members list preferences and votes from the least popular candidate are reassigned to others until a winner emerges .
who can enter ?
any lib dem mp who is nominated by at least 10 % of the parliamentary party and 200 members from at least 20 local lib dem parties .
and how long would the election take ?
the rules do not set a specific timetable but the last election took two months when paddy ashdown stood down and was replaced by mr kennedy in 1999 .

twenty-five mps , including eight of his shadow cabinet , have signed a statement saying they are no longer prepared to serve him .
is he going to go ?
mr kennedy 's spokesman says he will not resign " in any shape or form " this weekend .
the lib dem leader himself has said it would be a " dereliction of duty " to walk away from his job and claims to have " overwhelming support " among ordinary party members .
what happens now ?
senior mps and peers will continue to pile on the pressure for him to quit and if he fails to go are likely to call a confidence vote when parliament returns next week to try to change his mind .
what is the point of a confidence vote ?
mr kennedy has already called a leadership election so a confidence vote is not needed to force a contest .
but critical mps think it could still be a way of spelling out to their leader that he just can not continue .
even if he lost a confidence vote , mr kennedy could still be a candidate in the leadership contest .
what has happened to the leadership contest ?
the lib dem federal executive will meet in the next few days to start formally arranging the contest requested by mr kennedy .
who will stand ?
mr kennedy says he will stand but so far no other candidates have come forward .
sir menzies campbell , previously favourite to take over , and home affairs spokesman mark oaten both say they will not stand against mr kennedy .
party president simon hughes has yet to announce his intentions .
so the only name on the ballot paper could be mr kennedy 's ?
it could be - and if that happens he would be automatically re-elected as leader .
how would a leadership election work ?
there would be a secret ballot of all lib dem members - about 70,000 people - using the single transferable vote system where members list preferences and votes from the least popular candidate are reassigned to others until a winner emerges .
who can enter ?
any lib dem mp who is nominated by at least 10 % of the parliamentary party and 200 members from at least 20 local lib dem parties .
and how long would the election take ?
the rules do not set a specific timetable but the last election took two months when paddy ashdown stood down and was replaced by mr kennedy in 1999 .

in january 2005 , the equivalent of two months of rain fell over a 24-hour period in the city , pushing water levels to their highest ever .
the floods directly affected 1,925 properties and the cost of the damage to the city is estimated to be between £ 200m and £ 250m .
three people died in the storms which struck on the night of 7/8 january .
one of those who is still waiting to move back into her home is rachel lee .
she is hoping she will be able to return by march .
she said : " i am just going to see what happens , i have given up trying to set targets . "
in the aftermath of the floods , carlisle city council set up a system where those affected could speak to each other and pass on their experiences and she said she had found that very helpful .
the council also ran a major clean-up operation and offered advice and support to help people return to normal .
the carlisle renaissance project has been set up to set out a vision for the city for the next 10 to 15 years .

he was one of hundreds of people left homeless after floods swept through carlisle last january , leaving scenes of devastation in their wake .
twelve months on , his is one of about 400 homes which are still not ready to be moved back into , although he hopes to return by the end of the month .
he said he has been left drained by the experience of trying to get repairs done to his house after water wrecked the downstairs rooms .
" i have written off 2005 .
the whole year is one of frustration - it used to be anger and frustration - frustration that it has dragged on so long " , he said .
" there are so many elements outside the individual 's control .
you are not in control of your destiny .
" i am just plodding on .
i have got long past the stage where i rant and rave .
now it 's just a case of being resigned to it .
" i think the feeling now is that basically it 's gone on too long .
really it does n't feel like my house anymore .
it may be brand new and sparkly , but i have lost interest .
but there is relief that it could be finished soon . "
mr shakesby has been living out of two suitcases for the past year mr shakesby , 57 , lived in his house in holme terrace for about a month after the floods but the pressure of living without a bathroom and the continual noise and dust created by industrial driers became unbearable .
since then he has been renting a room from a friend in wigton and living out of two suitcases .
he said : " i do n't get paranoid when it rains but i am sure it will have a conscious effect on what i keep in the downstairs rooms .
" it does put a different reflection on what you need in life , having to live out of two suitcases . "
carlisle city council estimates the january floods directly affected 1,925 properties and the cost of the flood damage as up to £ 250m .
following the floods , the council ran a major clean-up , advice and support operation to help people recover .
the flood waters wrecked the downstairs rooms of the house in august , the carlisle renaissance project was launched setting out plans to revitalise the city over the next 10 to 15 years .
the anniversary was being marked on sunday by performances at the crown & mitre hotel , with people affected by the floods , emergency services and groups which provided assistance invited to reflect on the floods and look to the future .
the environment agency is in the process of a new flood defence scheme for the city , which was planned before the floods , to reduce the risk of floods .
work is due to start in the spring .
other measures include cctv and webcams at strategic points on rivers to keep an eye on blockages , temporary defences and new flood warning areas .
a spokeswoman said : " in terms of whether something like this can happen again , it 's impossible to say .
" the flood defence scheme will substantially reduce the flood risk , but obviously we can never predict what the weather will do .
there 's always a chance that something worse will come along .
" the rain we had this time last year was so exceptional - inches of rain , falling on to already wet ground , and gale force winds . "

mr shakesby has been living out of two suitcases for the past year mr shakesby , 57 , lived in his house in holme terrace for about a month after the floods but the pressure of living without a bathroom and the continual noise and dust created by industrial driers became unbearable .
