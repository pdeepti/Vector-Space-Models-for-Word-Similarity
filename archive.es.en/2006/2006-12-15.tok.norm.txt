the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.12.2006 why germany needs fewer economists , more stylists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you want a job , the beard will simply have to go !
in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !
who could possibly fail at a job interview with the help of such stylists ? forget milan , paris and new york .
apparently , germany is the place where fashion can really change people 's lives . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !
who could possibly fail at a job interview with the help of such stylists ? forget milan , paris and new york .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.12.2006 opinion : the courage of conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conviction of disgraced german referee robert hoyzer will only be a success for those authorities aiming to clean up soccer if it is the first of many , says dw-world.de 's nick amies . the decision by the federal court of justice in leipzig to sentence disgraced referee robert hoyzer to two years and five months in prison is a victory for the soccer authorities who have made it their mission to clean up the game ever since the match-fixing scandal first rocked germany in 2005 . upholding the berlin state court 's original sentence handed down in november last year sends a powerful message to others intent on manipulating the game for their own financial gain : if you pervert the rules , you will be punished . that message , in itself , is a step in the right direction .
long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .
" i think -lrb- the conservatives -rrb- would n't let him down .
i do n't think his candidacy is in danger at the moment .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.12.2006 opinion : the courage of conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conviction of disgraced german referee robert hoyzer will only be a success for those authorities aiming to clean up soccer if it is the first of many , says dw-world.de 's nick amies . the decision by the federal court of justice in leipzig to sentence disgraced referee robert hoyzer to two years and five months in prison is a victory for the soccer authorities who have made it their mission to clean up the game ever since the match-fixing scandal first rocked germany in 2005 . upholding the berlin state court 's original sentence handed down in november last year sends a powerful message to others intent on manipulating the game for their own financial gain : if you pervert the rules , you will be punished . that message , in itself , is a step in the right direction .
long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .

the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.12.2006 opinion : the courage of conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conviction of disgraced german referee robert hoyzer will only be a success for those authorities aiming to clean up soccer if it is the first of many , says dw-world.de 's nick amies . the decision by the federal court of justice in leipzig to sentence disgraced referee robert hoyzer to two years and five months in prison is a victory for the soccer authorities who have made it their mission to clean up the game ever since the match-fixing scandal first rocked germany in 2005 . upholding the berlin state court 's original sentence handed down in november last year sends a powerful message to others intent on manipulating the game for their own financial gain : if you pervert the rules , you will be punished . that message , in itself , is a step in the right direction .
long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .
-lrb- 15.12.2006 -rrb- appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .
but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense .

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .
why was the place nice ?
first , because of the excellent , fresh beer .
the second important thing was the atmosphere in the bar .
the people were relaxed .
they just came for a beer or two -lrb- or maybe more -rrb- , to tell some jokes and have a nice time .
people of all ages were speaking quietly and there was no music in the bar .
at that time of the year they produced a very tasty haberstumpf hopfen -lrb- doppel -rrb- bock , but generally the guests drink zwick ’ l , an unfiltered beer .
with my poor german , i tried to communicate with the locals who could speak english or german .
the people really tried to discuss and laugh at jokes , despite the language barriers and after a few zwick ’ ls we drank a doppelbock before running to the train station . - tivadar gaudenyi , neusatz , serbia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car highway tolls remain taboo in germany a debate surrounding tolls on german highways has broken out again , and while bavarian politicians continue pushing for an autobahn vignette , the federal government says it 's out of the question .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .
" i think -lrb- the conservatives -rrb- would n't let him down .
i do n't think his candidacy is in danger at the moment .

about 53 percent said they expect the economy to improve , a jump of 21 percent from last year . on a personal level , germans are also looking forward to 2007 in similar numbers to last year , according to the mannheim survey .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.12.2006 why germany needs fewer economists , more stylists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you want a job , the beard will simply have to go !
in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !
who could possibly fail at a job interview with the help of such stylists ? forget milan , paris and new york .
apparently , germany is the place where fashion can really change people 's lives . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .
why was the place nice ?
first , because of the excellent , fresh beer .
the second important thing was the atmosphere in the bar .
the people were relaxed .
they just came for a beer or two -lrb- or maybe more -rrb- , to tell some jokes and have a nice time .
people of all ages were speaking quietly and there was no music in the bar .
at that time of the year they produced a very tasty haberstumpf hopfen -lrb- doppel -rrb- bock , but generally the guests drink zwick ’ l , an unfiltered beer .
with my poor german , i tried to communicate with the locals who could speak english or german .
the people really tried to discuss and laugh at jokes , despite the language barriers and after a few zwick ’ ls we drank a doppelbock before running to the train station . - tivadar gaudenyi , neusatz , serbia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car highway tolls remain taboo in germany a debate surrounding tolls on german highways has broken out again , and while bavarian politicians continue pushing for an autobahn vignette , the federal government says it 's out of the question .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- when german words travel , our zeitgeist goes oom-pah-pah why do finnish buses take coffee breaks ?

i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .

during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 15.12.2006 german president under fire for political interventions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler has vetoed two laws in three months after calling them unconstitutional german president horst köhler is the target of increased criticism from government ministers who accuse of him of exceeding his mandate and interfering in political decisions . in germany , the role of president is a largely ceremonial one .
the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 15.12.2006 german president under fire for political interventions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler has vetoed two laws in three months after calling them unconstitutional german president horst köhler is the target of increased criticism from government ministers who accuse of him of exceeding his mandate and interfering in political decisions . in germany , the role of president is a largely ceremonial one .
the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .
" i think -lrb- the conservatives -rrb- would n't let him down .
i do n't think his candidacy is in danger at the moment . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president stops sale of air control company german president horst köhler exercised his first presidential veto on tuesday , quashing a law that would have partially privatized air traffic control in germany .
but that does n't mean the issue is settled .
-lrb- 24.10.2006 -rrb- stasi spied on german president köhler in 1980s east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , became infamous for its surveillance operations of prominent politicians during the cold war .
german president horst köhler is the latest to be revealed as a target .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- german leader calls for more active european role in iraq german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? -lrb- 15.11.2006 -rrb- feedback should the german president be given extended political powers ?

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .

during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .
" i think -lrb- the conservatives -rrb- would n't let him down .
i do n't think his candidacy is in danger at the moment .

" as the only german city that places a direct tax on women working in the world 's oldest profession , the city of cologne is slated to receive a record 828,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- in sex tax revenues in 2006 , an increase of about 38,000 euros over 2005 , a city spokesman told the german ddp news agency on friday . a global pioneer in taxing prostitutes , cologne instituted the 150-euro per month tax in 2004 , replacing voluntary reporting scheme .
this year germany 's fourth-largest city also instituted a " part-time " prostitute tax of six euros per day after authorities said a many prostitutes proved they only worked a few days a month and were being taxed unfairly . an established tax " -lrb- the tax -rrb- led to women sending in sick notes and proof of their vacations without being asked because they were not working during that time , " the city 's spokesman said , adding it was a sign that the tax had become an accepted cost of doing business for sex workers . the sex levy is part of the " pleasure tax , " which originally placed a duty on casinos and arcades and was later extended to include brothels , massage parlors and table-dancing clubs . the city 's finance department was not able to say how many prostitutes worked in the city as individual tax numbers could be registered to entire brothels .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .
" i think -lrb- the conservatives -rrb- would n't let him down .
i do n't think his candidacy is in danger at the moment .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.12.2006 why germany needs fewer economists , more stylists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you want a job , the beard will simply have to go !
in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !
who could possibly fail at a job interview with the help of such stylists ? forget milan , paris and new york .
apparently , germany is the place where fashion can really change people 's lives . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .
read up on a selection on recent articles about funny events in germany .

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !
who could possibly fail at a job interview with the help of such stylists ? forget milan , paris and new york .
apparently , germany is the place where fashion can really change people 's lives . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.12.2006 opinion : the courage of conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conviction of disgraced german referee robert hoyzer will only be a success for those authorities aiming to clean up soccer if it is the first of many , says dw-world.de 's nick amies . the decision by the federal court of justice in leipzig to sentence disgraced referee robert hoyzer to two years and five months in prison is a victory for the soccer authorities who have made it their mission to clean up the game ever since the match-fixing scandal first rocked germany in 2005 . upholding the berlin state court 's original sentence handed down in november last year sends a powerful message to others intent on manipulating the game for their own financial gain : if you pervert the rules , you will be punished . that message , in itself , is a step in the right direction .
long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !
who could possibly fail at a job interview with the help of such stylists ? forget milan , paris and new york .

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .

a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .

spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .
why was the place nice ?
first , because of the excellent , fresh beer .
the second important thing was the atmosphere in the bar .
the people were relaxed .
they just came for a beer or two -lrb- or maybe more -rrb- , to tell some jokes and have a nice time .
people of all ages were speaking quietly and there was no music in the bar .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .
why was the place nice ?
first , because of the excellent , fresh beer .
the second important thing was the atmosphere in the bar .
the people were relaxed .
they just came for a beer or two -lrb- or maybe more -rrb- , to tell some jokes and have a nice time .
people of all ages were speaking quietly and there was no music in the bar .
at that time of the year they produced a very tasty haberstumpf hopfen -lrb- doppel -rrb- bock , but generally the guests drink zwick ’ l , an unfiltered beer .
with my poor german , i tried to communicate with the locals who could speak english or german .
the people really tried to discuss and laugh at jokes , despite the language barriers and after a few zwick ’ ls we drank a doppelbock before running to the train station . - tivadar gaudenyi , neusatz , serbia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car highway tolls remain taboo in germany a debate surrounding tolls on german highways has broken out again , and while bavarian politicians continue pushing for an autobahn vignette , the federal government says it 's out of the question .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .
sapina 's brothers milan and filip , dominik marks and former player steffen karl received suspended jail sentences . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.12.2006 opinion : the courage of conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conviction of disgraced german referee robert hoyzer will only be a success for those authorities aiming to clean up soccer if it is the first of many , says dw-world.de 's nick amies . the decision by the federal court of justice in leipzig to sentence disgraced referee robert hoyzer to two years and five months in prison is a victory for the soccer authorities who have made it their mission to clean up the game ever since the match-fixing scandal first rocked germany in 2005 . upholding the berlin state court 's original sentence handed down in november last year sends a powerful message to others intent on manipulating the game for their own financial gain : if you pervert the rules , you will be punished . that message , in itself , is a step in the right direction .
long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .

the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .

" we say it will be closed .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .
why was the place nice ?
first , because of the excellent , fresh beer .
the second important thing was the atmosphere in the bar .
the people were relaxed .
they just came for a beer or two -lrb- or maybe more -rrb- , to tell some jokes and have a nice time .

i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.12.2006 opinion : the courage of conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conviction of disgraced german referee robert hoyzer will only be a success for those authorities aiming to clean up soccer if it is the first of many , says dw-world.de 's nick amies . the decision by the federal court of justice in leipzig to sentence disgraced referee robert hoyzer to two years and five months in prison is a victory for the soccer authorities who have made it their mission to clean up the game ever since the match-fixing scandal first rocked germany in 2005 . upholding the berlin state court 's original sentence handed down in november last year sends a powerful message to others intent on manipulating the game for their own financial gain : if you pervert the rules , you will be punished . that message , in itself , is a step in the right direction .
long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .
-lrb- 15.12.2006 -rrb- appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .
but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense .

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.12.2006 opinion : the courage of conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conviction of disgraced german referee robert hoyzer will only be a success for those authorities aiming to clean up soccer if it is the first of many , says dw-world.de 's nick amies . the decision by the federal court of justice in leipzig to sentence disgraced referee robert hoyzer to two years and five months in prison is a victory for the soccer authorities who have made it their mission to clean up the game ever since the match-fixing scandal first rocked germany in 2005 . upholding the berlin state court 's original sentence handed down in november last year sends a powerful message to others intent on manipulating the game for their own financial gain : if you pervert the rules , you will be punished . that message , in itself , is a step in the right direction .
long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .
otherwise , the hoyzer case will be remembered only as a face-saving exercise for german soccer . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling .
-lrb- 15.12.2006 -rrb- appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .
but both defense lawyers and prosecutors say that does n't mean he committed a criminal offense .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . i have been to dresden three times , only briefly .
i went on a day trip in 1993 .
reconstruction of the frauenkirche had just begun .
in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .
the city of cologne and the lake constance area were the areas i visited .
someone was always there to help with luggage or directions .
walking the streets of cologne or biking around the lake i continually ran into friendly people . - miriam lynn barron , farmerville , la , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay attention to street signs to avoid getting lost , recommends one tourist i lived in germany for a year .
although i lived in bonn , i spent a bit of time in berlin .
i recommend paying attention to the street names , especially on akademiestrasse , which is very big .
you can get lost easily , which is what happened to me . - orlando j. marin artavia costa rica my husband , daughter and i visited germany in november 2004 and again in december 2005 .
we visited cologne and berlin .
we were able to visit the christmas market in berlin , as it had just opened the day before we departed .
we decided to visit germany and austria in december 2006 because of our christmas market experience .
we are now hooked !
we love the food and the festive atmosphere .
we plan to return again . - j. werner i miss being there .
it has been over two years since my last trip to munich , berlin , hamburg , bremen , hanover , and dresden .
i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .
why was the place nice ?
first , because of the excellent , fresh beer .
the second important thing was the atmosphere in the bar .
the people were relaxed .
they just came for a beer or two -lrb- or maybe more -rrb- , to tell some jokes and have a nice time .
people of all ages were speaking quietly and there was no music in the bar .
at that time of the year they produced a very tasty haberstumpf hopfen -lrb- doppel -rrb- bock , but generally the guests drink zwick ’ l , an unfiltered beer .
with my poor german , i tried to communicate with the locals who could speak english or german .
the people really tried to discuss and laugh at jokes , despite the language barriers and after a few zwick ’ ls we drank a doppelbock before running to the train station . - tivadar gaudenyi , neusatz , serbia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car highway tolls remain taboo in germany a debate surrounding tolls on german highways has broken out again , and while bavarian politicians continue pushing for an autobahn vignette , the federal government says it 's out of the question .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone .

" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .

the head of state is usually the first to meet visiting dignitaries , open important events and institutions , and represent the country abroad as germany 's top diplomat .
in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .

in the past , the president has quietly gone about his business , letting the government and courts thrash out policy and law . the german president is by tradition a unifying presence and usually takes great care to steer clear of day to day politics .
the politicians have always preferred things to be this way , which is why many are becoming increasingly irritated by the current holder of office , president horst köhler . köhler has been making the most of the limited political clout he does have by ruffling feathers .
the president , not content to take a back seat , has become increasingly vocal in his criticizing of political decisions made by the current coalition government which has many politicians feeling he is overstepping the mark . used to less high-profile presidents like köhler 's late predecessor , johannes rau , who did not always agree with the government but let the federal constitutional court fight his public battles for him , the current german government has taken great exception to köhler 's desire to get more involved in the running of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's involvement in daily politics irks many ministers köhler has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sign a second law passed by the bundestag .
his refusal to sign a consumer information law on the grounds that it would impose obligations on local governments that he believes to be unconstitutional follows on from his rejection in october of a law allowing the partial privatization of germany 's air traffic control system . there are even suspicions that köhler may use his veto again when it comes to passing hartz iv labor law reforms later this week . köhler accused of infringing on court 's power there have been presidents in the past who have stopped one law , but until now nobody had done it twice .
during the previous presidency , rau would sign off on a law even if he disagreed with it , knowing that the federal constitutional court would have the final say in denying the passing of the law .
köhler is now being accused of taking on a role which belongs to the court and not to the german president . the criticism of köhler 's intervention in daily politics has been so harsh that government spokesman thomas steg recently called for a moderation in tone . " the president is well aware of his duties and responsibilities , " steg said .
" public assignations are to be stopped with due respect to the highest authority in the german state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel refuses to criticize köhler in public the harshest attacks have come from the conservatives , the party that the president belonged to before he was elected by the federal assembly in 2004 .
however , chancellor angela merkel , who has often professed a mutual respect and esteem between herself and the president , has so far refused to join the debate .
it is understood though that merkel intends to bring up the topic of köhler 's interventions with the president during a scheduled meeting before christmas . ex per t says president is acting constitutionally but criticism has also come from the social democrats , whose parliamentary leader , peter struck , said the president can not be the ultimate voice of power within the juridical system .
spd parliamentarian olaf scholz added that there was one power that should decide on germany 's laws and that was the constitutional court . professor jürgen falter , an expert on the german political system , told deutsche welle that he though this criticism of köhler was unjustified . " i think -lrb- köhler 's -rrb- constitutional position is very sound , " he said .
" the president is sworn in on an oath of loyalty to the german constitution and this gives him the duty to stop any law which is unconstitutional according to his view . " of course he could pass laws and let the constitutional court decide on its future , " falter added .
" but on the other hand , i think he would be wrong if he did n't stop a law if he was really convinced that it is unconstitutional . " media speculation over köhler 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such is the increasing criticism that some sections of the german media are already suggesting that köhler 's re-election in two and a half years might be in jeopardy .
however , professor falter was not convinced that köhler 's chances for a second term are in any real danger . " it could happen but then you would have to find another candidate and a very convincing one that is backed by the cdu , " falter said .
" i think -lrb- the conservatives -rrb- would n't let him down .
i do n't think his candidacy is in danger at the moment .

i got many bayern munich hats and a hertha berlin scarf . - bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one visitor from serbia enjoyed drinking zwickel beer with the locals franconia , the northeastern part of bavaria , is what i call the heartland of beers .
with about 4 million citizens , there is great diversity of local beers - they have more than 200 small breweries .
for every beer fan , this is a place of special interests .
during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .
why was the place nice ?
first , because of the excellent , fresh beer .
the second important thing was the atmosphere in the bar .
the people were relaxed .
they just came for a beer or two -lrb- or maybe more -rrb- , to tell some jokes and have a nice time .
people of all ages were speaking quietly and there was no music in the bar .
at that time of the year they produced a very tasty haberstumpf hopfen -lrb- doppel -rrb- bock , but generally the guests drink zwick ’ l , an unfiltered beer .
with my poor german , i tried to communicate with the locals who could speak english or german .
the people really tried to discuss and laugh at jokes , despite the language barriers and after a few zwick ’ ls we drank a doppelbock before running to the train station . - tivadar gaudenyi , neusatz , serbia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car highway tolls remain taboo in germany a debate surrounding tolls on german highways has broken out again , and while bavarian politicians continue pushing for an autobahn vignette , the federal government says it 's out of the question .

in september 2005 , i walked around for three hours and noticed a vast difference from my 1993 visit .
i was unable to get reservations in dresden this september because of a trade show so i stayed in nearby meissen and saw the porcelain factory there . i was able to get to dresden to go to an organ vesper service in the frauenkirche , which i 'd wanted to see .
i also explored the neustadt and was impressed with the königstrasse , the fountains at the albertplatz and the alaunstrasse area .
i would like to spend more time in dresden .
my family always felt that the bombing of dresden was totally unnecessary and i have always had a great interest in dresden , probably due to dresden china -lrb- correctly , meissen china -rrb- , of which we had several pieces . - peter iveson my biggest surprise on my trip in germany was just how friendly and helpful the people were .

during my last visit to germany i had a nice time at many pubs .
the last one , in a village called trebgast , was very unique .
the furniture was cozy - wooden , warm and smoked .
this was a good place to meet the locals in this small protestant village .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "
hoyzer , it seems , has become a victim of interpretation . while this ambiguity remains , there is always a chance that future manipulators will be willing to take the chance that a court will see things in a different light .
until there is a clear law that lays out the specifics of the crime of sporting fraud and has a solid framework in place for convictions , there will always be people who are willing to take the risk . prison sentences for powerful wrong-doers second , for this conviction to continue to make waves in the soccer world , it must be made clear that no-one is above the law . a 27-year-old referee convicted of throwing a few lower league games is one thing , bringing down powerful but corrupt people in the game is another .
there is a danger that hoyzer could become merely an example , one that can be easily dismissed by those with enough power and influence to avoid even stepping into a court room , let alone facing a conviction before the bar . in the worst scandal in italian soccer history this year , those involved were punished on a sporting and employment level and yet there have been no criminal convictions .
while the clubs involved were dealt the blows of relegation and docked points , individuals like former juventus general manager luciano moggi and ex-chief executive antonio giraudo were suspended from soccer for a maximum of five years , with a recommendation from the investigating committee to extend the ban for life . their crimes were similar to those of ante sapina , the ringleader in the hoyzer case who was jailed for two year and eleven months , in so much as they exerted pressure on referees to influence matches .
and yet , neither faces a prison term . the conviction of hoyzer will only be for the good of the game as a whole if it leads to wrong-doers - whoever they are - being held accountable to the law for their actions .

long has soccer suffered from unscrupulous types bending the laws and slipping through loopholes to profit personally from the sport ; one which relies mainly on the support of the honest , loyal fans who put their hands deep in their pockets every week to follow their team . this conviction is rightly being seen as a victory in the battle against the petty crooks and gangsters who leech off soccer .
but the question remains whether this victory in the long term will turn out to be a hollow one . legal gray area of sporting fraud first , the legal basis for the decision remains shrouded in a deep , gray mist .
a week before hoyzer 's conviction was upheld , both the prosecuting counsel and hoyzer 's defense team were questioning the legitimacy of convicting the former referee on fraud charges . both sides recalled previous cases where illegal betting and manipulation within a sport had led to a court trial ; the examples being two german horse-racing scandals , one in 1961 and one in 1979 .
in these cases , the earlier was thrown out of court , the latter upheld with a conviction .
the argument from both legal teams centered on the ambiguity of the law regarding fraud and sport .
how could two similar cases result in two different verdicts ?
surely if a law had been broken , both would result in the same punishment . while it is obvious that hoyzer committed a moral crime , it is less clear - going by the letter of the law - that he committed an actual crime .
as prosecutor hartmut schneider said last week , what hoyzer was guilty of was an act of " trickery but criminal liability does not come into it . "

in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !

german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes .

in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .

policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .

" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.12.2006 why germany needs fewer economists , more stylists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you want a job , the beard will simply have to go !
in addition to their lawmaking duties , german politicians may soon have to start working as fashion consultants .
apparently , germany could solve its economic problems if the unemployed would only get a sense of style . politics and fashion go hand in hand .
during her rise to power , german chancellor angela merkel walked that thorny path that a somber but stern taskmistress has to walk if she is to become a fearsome , opera-attending powerfrau .
along the way , she had her ups and downs , which for a long time translated to moderately good , bad and extremely bad hair days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel worked hard to get her image right in the end , however , merkel seems to have found her personal , fashion nirvana in the no-thrills , tailored suits that exude western confidence and confucian poise .
german fashion designer wolfgang joop even dedicated a line of clothing to the german chancellor , inspired by what he called " clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes . " politicians - including merkel 's coalition partner kurt beck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- - know all that .
in many ways , fashion does make a man - or the woman .
yet , until recently , very few politicians would have dared to suggest that germany 's army of unemployed citizens ca n't find a job simply because they have no sense of style .
after all , germany 's economy is usually not thought of as a large-scale milan runway . and - despite what some easy-going us american tourists feel when they are denied entry to a german disco because of their recognizable sneakers and khaki cargo shorts - fashion police is not an institution officially funded by the german government .
policing fashion is what self-censoring germans do for fun . time to wash up the spd 's beck recently unleashed his inner fashion policeman during a visit to a christmas market in wiesbaden .
a reportedly tipsy henrico frank - a long-haired fan of facial piercing and the unshaven , scruffy look - approached beck to vent some frustration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody ever complained about kurt beck 's beard " you are responsible for hartz iv , " frank said , referring to the unpopular set of german labor law reforms .
" and i am unemployed ! " what was beck to do ?
as a social democrat , he had to show that he was close to the people .
he could n't really blame the previous government because he was a part of it .
he could n't hold frank 's hand , get teary-eyed and say how sorry he was , because that would mean admitting defeat .
so he decided to give the unemployed of this country some hope . " if you take a shower and shave , you 'll have a job in three weeks , " beck said . surprise , surprise to be perfectly honest , beck himself is not exactly the best-shaven man on the german political scene .
yet his bohemian stubble clearly did not prevent his rise to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beard is gone , but the earrings stayed : henrico frank henrico frank however , in deference to beck 's age , experience and impeccable cv , did exactly what he was told .
the 37-year-old went out and got himself a makeover .
then , he called a press conference and presented his new , clean-shaven look on thursday .
and - probably to the horror of beck - the clock started ticking .
will he really have a job in three weeks ? this is the stuff that reality-tv docusoaps are made of .
in 2004 , one such show - " the swan : finally beautiful " captivated the imagination of the more depressed portion of germany 's tv viewers . one can only hope that somebody will come up with the idea of a makeover show in which high-ranking politicians sponsor unemployed candidates and help them get a job .
imagine getting mascara-applying tips from angela merkel or dieting advice from germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer !
who could possibly fail at a job interview with the help of such stylists ? forget milan , paris and new york .
apparently , germany is the place where fashion can really change people 's lives . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.12.2006 disgraced referee hoyzer jailed after losing appeal hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months behind bars disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer will serve his two-year and five-month jail term after his court appeal was turned down despite both prosecuting and defense counsels questioning the initial ruling . a former referee convicted for match-fixing in germany failed on friday in his appeal against a prison sentence of two years and five months .
robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .

this year germany 's fourth-largest city also instituted a " part-time " prostitute tax of six euros per day after authorities said a many prostitutes proved they only worked a few days a month and were being taxed unfairly . an established tax " -lrb- the tax -rrb- led to women sending in sick notes and proof of their vacations without being asked because they were not working during that time , " the city 's spokesman said , adding it was a sign that the tax had become an accepted cost of doing business for sex workers . the sex levy is part of the " pleasure tax , " which originally placed a duty on casinos and arcades and was later extended to include brothels , massage parlors and table-dancing clubs . the city 's finance department was not able to say how many prostitutes worked in the city as individual tax numbers could be registered to entire brothels .

robert hoyzer had taken his case to germany 's highest judicial court in the eastern city of leipzig in a bid to seek a reduction in his sentence .
the severity of the sentence handed down last year surprised many observers because prosecutors had only called for a suspended jail term . the court also rejected appeals from four other defendants , including ante sapina , a croat who was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison for masterminding the match-rigging scandal . handing down the verdict , chief judge clemens basdorf said , " the confidence of millions of spectators in the sport of soccer and the impartiality of referees was undermined . " the president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , welcomed the decision , saying it showed that hoyzer 's actions were " not just roguish , but cheating which must be punished . " " this is important for football and for the whole of society .
if the conviction had been overturned , people would have been left without bearings , " zwanziger said . last week , prosecutor hartmut schneider said that hoyzer 's jail sentence handed down in november 2005 was unsound because hoyzer had not technically broken the law . " it was trickery , " he said .
" but criminal liability does not come into it . " gray area of fraud rulings led to appeal claiming that the original court did not properly examine previous rulings in similar types of cases , schneider said the ruling last year had been " remarkably shallow " and had taken into account public pressure to wrap up the case well before the 2006 world cup which germany hosted . also inferring to the ambiguity of previous cases , hoyzer 's lawyer thomas hermes said that the federal court of appeals had recorded two different rulings in two similar cases in the past .
he said that in a 1961 horse betting scandal , the court ruled it was not fraud in a legal sense but in a similar racing case in 1979 the judgment determined it was fraud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betting case precedents could n't save hoyzer from jail after a lengthy investigation into illegal betting in german soccer , hoyzer admitted to receiving money to rig matches for a croatian mafia circle in berlin .the scandal rocked germany ahead of this summer 's world cup . hoyzer received death threats after admitting his guilt on television with explanations on how he doctored matches in lower league and cup games in germany for financial gain . other sentences likely to be upheld the shamed referee was not alone in the scandal : croat ante sapina and his two brothers , and another former referee , dominik marks , were part of a two million euro -lrb- $ 2.6-million -rrb- betting scam . the matches concerned were mainly in the german second and third division , but a german cup match between first division sv hamburg and third division paderborn and a first division match in turkey between ankaragucu and galatasaray were also affected . the paderborn-hamburg game was the most notorious incident in the case .
hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg 's emile mpenza to help the regional league side recover from two goals down to beat their first division opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ante sapina is unlikely to be released sapina made more than 750,000 euros from paderborn 's 4-2 victory , the indictment said .
hoyzer 's overall reward was 67,000 euros and an expensive new television set for the nine matches he fixed or tried to fix . hoyzer was convicted of six counts of being an accessory to fraud and sentenced to two years and five months .
the berlin district court also sentenced ante sapina to a jail term of two years and 11 months .
sapina 's brothers milan and filip , dominik marks and former player steffen karl received suspended jail sentences . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : appeals court ponders freeing corrupt referee former soccer referee robert hoyzer conspired to alter the outcome of matches with his decisions .

the problem of rising prevalence in obesity may get much worse - rates could climb still further , bankrupting the health system and leading soon to reductions in life expectancy " professor naveed sattar , from the university of glasgow the number should be promoted on the labels of all clothes sold with a waist of more than 40in -lrb- 102cm -rrb- for men , 37in -lrb- 94cm -rrb- for boys , 35in -lrb- 88cm -rrb- for women , and 31in -lrb- 80cm -rrb- for girls .
professor sattar , an expert in metabolic medicine , said research had linked obesity to a range of diseases and disorders , including heart disease , cancer , depression , back pain , diabetes and skin problems .
he said : " the problem of rising prevalence in obesity may get much worse - rates could climb still further , bankrupting the health system and leading soon to reductions in life expectancy .
" so we need to think out of the box , nothing that has been looked at so far seem to have worked . "
he said while individuals " clearly have some responsibility for their health " , the rest of society should also play more of a role .
he said the food industry should own up to the role they play through advertising and schools should be doing more to promote good diets and lifestyles .
he also called for obesity to become a core part of medical training and for public health consequences to be considered " for all decisions made in public life " .
some of the other measures recommended include : health checks , including waist and weight measurements , for all school leavers stricter planning regulations to only allow new housing complexes if they have sports facilities and green parks nearby fund obesity surgery for people with a body mass index of over 40 tax processed food high in sugar and salt only allow new urban roads if they have cycle lanes future the government published a public health white paper two years ago which promised to put the issue at the top of the agenda .

professor anthony barnett , head of the diabetes and obesity research group at the university of birmingham , said the dire prediction could well come true .
" it is heading in that direction .
the world health organization recently suggested 70 % of deaths will be due to obesity related illnesses in the future .

" at a time when an emphasis on prevention is needed more than ever , the nhs is slashing public health spending simply to make ends meet . "
but janice bhend , a former editor of yes magazine , which targets larger women , said the idea of a clothes phone line was a " ghastly idea " .
" we need to come at it from a different angle but i do n't think the fat police need to start telling us to phone a helpline . "
she added it was enough to make people depressed .

the problem of rising prevalence in obesity may get much worse - rates could climb still further , bankrupting the health system and leading soon to reductions in life expectancy professor naveed sattar , from the university of glasgow the number should be promoted on the labels of all clothes sold with a waist of more than 40in -lrb- 102cm -rrb- for men , 37in -lrb- 94cm -rrb- for boys , 35in -lrb- 88cm -rrb- for women , and 31in -lrb- 80cm -rrb- for girls .
professor sattar , an expert in metabolic medicine , said research had linked obesity to a range of diseases and disorders , including heart disease , cancer , depression , back pain , diabetes and skin problems .
he said : " the problem of rising prevalence in obesity may get much worse - rates could climb still further , bankrupting the health system and leading soon to reductions in life expectancy .
" so we need to think out of the box , nothing that has been looked at so far seem to have worked . "
he said while individuals " clearly have some responsibility for their health " , the rest of society should also play more of a role .
he said the food industry should own up to the role they play through advertising and schools should be doing more to promote good diets and lifestyles .
he also called for obesity to become a core part of medical training and for public health consequences to be considered " for all decisions made in public life " .
some of the other measures recommended include : health checks , including waist and weight measurements , for all school leavers stricter planning regulations to only allow new housing complexes if they have sports facilities and green parks nearby fund obesity surgery for people with a body mass index of over 40 tax processed food high in sugar and salt only allow new urban roads if they have cycle lanes future the government published a public health white paper two years ago which promised to put the issue at the top of the agenda .
this came after a report by former natwest chief derek wanless claimed unless the nation became healthier , spending on the nhs would increase by £ 30bn over the following 20 years .
professor anthony barnett , head of the diabetes and obesity research group at the university of birmingham , said the dire prediction could well come true .
" it is heading in that direction .
the world health organization recently suggested 70 % of deaths will be due to obesity related illnesses in the future .
" in the uk , we have one of the worst problems and that is and will continue to put a terrific strain on the health service . "
and steve webb , health spokesman for the liberal democrats , said : " this staggering analysis must be a wake-up call for the government , which has failed to get a grip on key public health challenges such as obesity .
" at a time when an emphasis on prevention is needed more than ever , the nhs is slashing public health spending simply to make ends meet . "
but janice bhend , a former editor of yes magazine , which targets larger women , said the idea of a clothes phone line was a " ghastly idea " .
" we need to come at it from a different angle but i do n't think the fat police need to start telling us to phone a helpline . "
she added it was enough to make people depressed .

attorney general lord goldsmith said the sfo was " discontinuing " its investigation into britain 's biggest defence company , bae systems .
the reversal follows reports that saudi arabia was considering pulling out of a deal to buy eurofighter jets from bae .
lord goldsmith said he thought that a prosecution " could not be brought " .
he said the decision had been made in the wider public interest , which had to be balanced against the rule of law .
no weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest serious fraud office statement what makes eurofighter fly ?
lord goldsmith also told peers that prime minister tony blair had agreed that the continuation of the investigation would cause " serious damage " to relations between the uk and saudi arabia .
the probe had related to the al yamamah arms deal with saudi arabia .
bae has denied any wrongdoing .
job fears it emerged earlier this month that french and saudi officials were in talks over a possible alternative deal , which could scupper the bae sale .
the saudi government was reported to have been angered by the sfo investigation into allegations of a slush fund for members of the country 's royal family .
lord goldsmith said that both mr blair and defence secretary des browne had argued that carrying on the investigation would harm intelligence and diplomatic co-operation with saudi arabia , in turn damaging the uk 's national security .
no one is going to win any saudi business until this sfo investigation ends senior defence executive uk defence firms ' fears responding to the announcement , bae systems said : " after over two years of what has been a thorough investigation by the sfo , we welcome the statement made today by the attorney general in the house of lords . "
bbc business editor robert peston says that major uk companies - both arms firms and other manufacturers - have voiced fears that they stood to lose other lucrative deals should the probe have continued .
the sfo said its decision had been taken " following representations that have been made both to the attorney general and the director of the sfo concerning the need to safeguard national and international security " .
it added : " no weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest . "
the al yamamah contract with saudi arabia is thought to have been worth £ 40bn to bae systems over the past two decades .
saudi arabia said in august that it planned to buy 72 eurofighters to replace its range of tornado jets , which were also made by bae .
liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman simon hughes said : " from the moment investigations began , it was clear that they would not be popular in saudi arabia .
" but to pull the plug halfway through , and when real progress was just being made , is the worst of all possible outcomes .
" it is not in the interests of a successful british defence industry , of british exports , or of british diplomatic interests around the world that we can not now show that our legal system is above undue influence or improper pressure . "
but shadow defence secretary liam fox said : " we made it clear that because of the commercial issues involved we wanted the sfo to make a rapid decision about whether to continue their inquiry or whether to bring it to an end .

lord goldsmith said that both mr blair and defence secretary des browne had argued that carrying on the investigation would harm intelligence and diplomatic co-operation with saudi arabia , in turn damaging the uk 's national security .
no one is going to win any saudi business until this sfo investigation ends senior defence executive uk defence firms ' fears responding to the announcement , bae systems said : " after over two years of what has been a thorough investigation by the sfo , we welcome the statement made today by the attorney general in the house of lords . "
bbc business editor robert peston says that major uk companies - both arms firms and other manufacturers - have voiced fears that they stood to lose other lucrative deals should the probe have continued .
the sfo said its decision had been taken " following representations that have been made both to the attorney general and the director of the sfo concerning the need to safeguard national and international security " .
it added : " no weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest . "
the al yamamah contract with saudi arabia is thought to have been worth £ 40bn to bae systems over the past two decades .
saudi arabia said in august that it planned to buy 72 eurofighters to replace its range of tornado jets , which were also made by bae .
liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman simon hughes said : " from the moment investigations began , it was clear that they would not be popular in saudi arabia .
" but to pull the plug halfway through , and when real progress was just being made , is the worst of all possible outcomes .
" it is not in the interests of a successful british defence industry , of british exports , or of british diplomatic interests around the world that we can not now show that our legal system is above undue influence or improper pressure . "
but shadow defence secretary liam fox said : " we made it clear that because of the commercial issues involved we wanted the sfo to make a rapid decision about whether to continue their inquiry or whether to bring it to an end .
" having decided there is no case to answer , it will be welcomed by all those concerned . "

fundraisers at the 900-year-old cathedral , which is suffering from age and pollution , said £ 1m raised on friday " would make a real difference " .
" unless the campaign raises £ 50m over the next five years , the people of kent could face a future without their cathedral , " spokesman david innes said .
scaffolding is already up at the world heritage site as repairs take place .
a £ 50m fundraising drive began in october for the building in kent and individual donations alone raised more than £ 300,000 in the first month .
war damage previous renovation projects were paid for by fundraising appeals about every 30 years .
when the campaign was launched , it was revealed that the roof had serious structural problems resulting from repairs after world war ii , when supporting beams were encased in concrete .
the building 's south side also had a " serious hidden defect " resulting from war damage - a fireball from a bomb dropped in 1942 created a vacuum which pulled out the outer limestone skin of the cathedral and sand and cement used to fill the void were now causing damage .
the materials were the only ones available at the time .
half the 1m visitors to the cathedral every year pay entrance fees , but they just cover the annual running costs of the building .
trusts and charities have expressed an interest in getting involved with the fundraising , the cathedral said .

dame eliza , 58 , who has been in the post since october 2002 , will leave by april and her replacement will be appointed by home secretary john reid .
she said she had planned the move early last year , before the attacks in london , after 33 years in the service .
she added that mi5 was facing two big challenges - the " serious threat " and the need to adapt to that threat .
dramatic change in a statement , she said : " by april 2007 i shall have been an officer of the security service for 33 years , the last 10 as either deputy director general or director general .
" i decided in early 2005 that it would be time by then to stand down .
" i have been privileged to lead the service when it is facing the two challenges of a very serious threat and the consequent need to grow and change at a dramatic rate to tackle that threat .
" i 'm confident that the service will continue to serve the uk to the best of its ability and i shall watch its progress with great interest . "
dame eliza 's resignation was agreed with the former home secretary , charles clarke , who was sacked in may .
' dedicated service ' the suicide bombings on london 's transport network in july last year put her under the spotlight and dame eliza has recently spoken of the continuing terror threat facing britain .
mr reid said : " eliza has given 33 years of dedicated service to the nation and we owe her a tremendous debt of gratitude .
" for the last 10 years she has served as deputy director general and director general of the security service , leading the service through a time of significant change and growth .
" her contribution to the security of our nation has been invaluable and i pay tribute to her unstinting efforts on our behalf . "

the news allayed fears that japan 's economy might be running out of steam and boosted tokyo 's nikkei stock index , which closed at a seven-month high .
shares of machine makers gained most after the so-called tankan survey indicated they were investing heavily .
despite the strong data , the bank of japan is still seen as unlikely to raise interest rates next week .
earlier in the month conflicting data had confused the markets when unemployment had fallen sharply , while economic growth for the three month to september had been much weaker than expected .
the nikkei index closed at 16,941 - a gain of 85 points .

" they are paying a pretty full price , " said marc desmidt of merrill lynch investment managers .
" but they do get good growth in emerging markets and they are getting very strong cash flow . "
satoru aoyama , an analyst at fitch ratings , said japan tobacco was looking to boost its global market share with one big purchase .
" we might say it is a strategy to survive , " he said .
gallaher employs 12,000 people worldwide , is the world 's fifth-largest cigarette maker , and is a top producer in markets including austria , kazakhstan , the republic of ireland , russia , sweden , and the uk .
it is currently the world 's fifth-largest cigarette maker , and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of japan tobacco after the bid .

the cash offer of £ 11.40 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- a share has been accepted by gallaher 's board , and covers its debts of about $ 4.3bn.
japan tobacco , which makes mild seven cigarettes , wants greater access to european and former soviet nations as it looks for growing markets .
following the bid , it will be able to make 600 billion cigarettes a year .
' full price ' however , some analysts questioned the amount of money paid by japan tobacco , which is half-owned by the japanese government and owns the non-us rights to the camel , winston and salem brands .
" they are paying a pretty full price , " said marc desmidt of merrill lynch investment managers .
" but they do get good growth in emerging markets and they are getting very strong cash flow . "
satoru aoyama , an analyst at fitch ratings , said japan tobacco was looking to boost its global market share with one big purchase .
" we might say it is a strategy to survive , " he said .
gallaher employs 12,000 people worldwide , is the world 's fifth-largest cigarette maker , and is a top producer in markets including austria , kazakhstan , the republic of ireland , russia , sweden , and the uk .
it is currently the world 's fifth-largest cigarette maker , and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of japan tobacco after the bid .
on thursday , gallaher shares had closed above the offer at £ 11.55 a share .

but the serious fraud office was really getting stuck into it .
until , that is , the sfo was given information about a specific threat to british security from the breakdown of relations with saudi arabia .
it wo n't say what that was .
but the director of the sfo , robert wardle , had no doubt that it was real .
so although there have been plenty of allegations that the inquiry has been stopped because of a threat to the profits and jobs of british companies , especially bae , the sfo is insisting to me that it was not motivated by those factors .
on the other hand , i am in no doubt that tony blair was extremely concerned about the impact on bae and other exporters , such as rolls royce , of a possible commercial boycott by saudi .
for him at least - and he was consulted by the attorney general , lord goldsmith , ahead of this decision - the impact on the british economy was a material factor .
prospects for prosecution for those searching for conspiracies , there is one other important fact .
the sfo says it was its own decision to pull the investigation .
it was not forced to do so by the attorney , though the attorney general does have the power to do this .
however there is a difference of opinion between the attorney and the sfo on what the prospects were for a successful prosecution .
lord goldsmith indicated yesterday that he thought it was really unlikely there would ever be a successful prosecution , even if the sfo had been given the go-ahead to continue the probe for 18 months and delve into swiss bank accounts connected to the saudis .
by contrast , the sfo was - and remains - more confident that it would have put together a credible case for prosecution .
which is why criticisms like those of the liberal democrats will resonate .
and , as i say , it was national security considerations that persuaded the sfo to pull the plug .

astronauts robert curbeam and christer fuglesang began the five-hour excursion at 1441 est -lrb- 1941 gmt -rrb- on thursday .
to prepare for the work , flight controllers on the ground powered down half of the station 's systems .
a third spacewalk is planned for saturday , but astronauts may also perform a fourth , unscheduled outing to fix a stuck solar panel on the iss .
the array , which needs to be folded away to make room for new solar panels , jammed as the astronauts attempted to retract it by remote control .
it has been six years since the 35m -lrb- 115ft -rrb- wing , which has served as the space station 's primary power source , was deployed and it has not been retracted during that period .
new solar panels , fitted in september , will take over the job of powering the iss , boosting its power by about 50 % .
the team spent hours grappling with the panel , comparing the process to folding up a road map , before finally admitting defeat after the system stuck .
a solar panel on the space station failed to retract iss resident michael lopez-alegria told houston : " we all tried as much up here as you guys did on the ground and it just was n't going to work for us today .
" but that stuff happens and i 'm sure we 'll get through it . "
on friday , the team will attempt to wiggle the panel free from inside the iss .
however if this fails , nasa officials are considering the possibility of an extra spacewalk to carry out a hands-on repair , which would take place on sunday or monday .
night flight the mission is taking place to finish the $ 100bn -lrb- £ 50bn -rrb- station .
at least 14 more missions are needed .
discovery blasted off from florida at the weekend in the first night launch of a space shuttle for four years , after being delayed for two days because of bad weather .
discovery 's launch left a fiery trail in the florida sky the landing date is set for 21 december back at the kennedy space center .
it is as yet unclear whether an additional spacewalk would prolong the trip which is scheduled to last 12 days .
discovery 's crew consists of commander mark polansky , pilot william oefelein and mission specialists robert curbeam , joan higginbotham , nicholas patrick , sunita williams and the european space agency astronaut christer fuglesang .
a british-born astronaut , nicholas patrick , is among discovery 's crew .
for five of the seven astronauts , this is their first shuttle flight .
one of crew , us astronaut sunita williams , will stay on at the iss when discovery heads home , taking german thomas reiter back to earth .
