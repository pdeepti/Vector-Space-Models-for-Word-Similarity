but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's best germany ends nationwide pep talk germans gloomy about the future do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired ! germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 germany launches world cup charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are stiff and dour-faced germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's best germany ends nationwide pep talk germans gloomy about the future do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired ! germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 germany launches world cup charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are stiff and dour-faced germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

but his break from the glaring criticism was short-lived .
less than a week later , franz beckenbauer lashed out at the germany national coach for failing to attend a workshop of top officials from all 32 world cup finalists . " it 's incredible that he 's not here , " the self-proclaimed kaiser of german soccer said at a press conference in düsseldorf monday .
" as host country you have to be here .
nearly all the coaches are here .
carlos alberto parreira came from brazil , sven-goran eriksson came from england , but our head coach is not here . " beckenbauer , who is the president of germany 's organizing committee for the world cup and instrumental in bringing the 2006 soccer championship to germany , berated klinsmann for skipping out of his duties as coach and a representative of the host country . bildunterschrift : soccer coaches for the participating countries of the world cup pose for photographers " he should have been here .
this is an obligatory meeting and he does not have all that many meetings that are obligatory , " beckenbauer told reporters and then added tersely : " i do n't want to say anything more about it because the more i think about it , the more drastic my choice of words will become . " the two-day gathering of world cup coaches had been planned for some time and was designed to give the officials a chance to discuss technical issues .
klinsmann 's assistants , oliver bierhoff and joachim löw , represented the german team . klinsmann in the spotlight klinsmann , who has been commuting between his native germany and his home in southern california since taking the job in august 2004 , has had to endure harsh criticism after his side 's embarrassing performance in italy last week .
the game , which was one of just a handful of pre-tournament friendlies , had been billed as key to testing germany 's skills .
instead it ended in a crushing 1-4 loss . many in the media and soccer world pinned the blame on klinsmann 's decision to stay based in the us ahead of the world cup .
several bundesliga coaches and german officials have argued that the national coach should be in germany to watch matches every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann during a practice at the stadio artemio franchi stadium in florence klinsmann has rejected the criticism .
" i was in gemrany for three of the last five weeks after the bundesliga started up after the winter break , " he told mass-circulation daily bild .
" i 've got my plan with everything necessary for the world cup preparations . " private interests should take back seat the 60-year-old beckenbauer , who lives just south of the german border in austria , has for the most part supported his younger colleague 's decisions and rarely criticized klinsmann in public .
but he said the national coach needed to show more presence in germany at the very least to calm the country 's nerves after the defeat in florence last week . " i do n't know how often i 've spoken with him and told him that he must be in germany during the final run-up to the tournament , " a visibly angry beckenbauer told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer expresses his frustration over klinsmann 's absence with only 94 days left before the world cup kicks off in june , klinsmann has very little time left to quell the fears of his critics – and their number is growing . on tuesday politicians from all sides of the spectrum joined the klinsmann bashing and attacked his plans to stay in california .
" there are only three months left before the start .
jürgen klinsmann belongs here in germany , " said detlef parr the sports expert for the opposition neo-liberal free democrats . " the national trainer would be well advised to come here , " added stephan mayer , the christian social union 's representative in the federal sporting commission .
" mr. klinsmann must now learn to push his private interests aside for the world cup . " interior minister lends support but klinsmann has at least one strong ally in the interior ministry , which is responsible for sports and ultimately for a successful world cup .
in an interview published in the bild newspaper on monday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended klinsmann and declared that the germany team " will not disappoint us . " he confessed that the german soccer federation " knew klinsmann would not be easy to handle , " but said he did not " believe in changing horses in the middle of the river .

" my führer - the really true truth about adolf hitler " is billed as a parody of the hit german drama " der untergang " -lrb- downfall -rrb- about the nazi leader 's last days , but this time featuring a sniveling hitler wallowing in his defeats . its swiss director , dani levy , 48 , is an established filmmaker best known for the first german jewish comedy since world war ii , " alles auf zucker " -lrb- go for zucker -rrb- , which was a critical success in germany and abroad in 2004 . a shaggy-haired comedian famous for his gag hit " litter box , " helge schneider , has been enlisted to play the führer in the film , whose release date had not yet been announced .

filming on the picture began in january and is to wrap up in the coming weeks .
no fears voiced so far the mass-selling daily bild recently asked whether it was right to make a german comedy about the nazi period , but the leader of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , told the newspaper monday he did not see a problem .

but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be tough , but german students are determined to learn chinese english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be tough , but german students are determined to learn chinese english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

but his break from the glaring criticism was short-lived .
less than a week later , franz beckenbauer lashed out at the germany national coach for failing to attend a workshop of top officials from all 32 world cup finalists . " it 's incredible that he 's not here , " the self-proclaimed kaiser of german soccer said at a press conference in düsseldorf monday .
" as host country you have to be here .
nearly all the coaches are here .
carlos alberto parreira came from brazil , sven-goran eriksson came from england , but our head coach is not here . " beckenbauer , who is the president of germany 's organizing committee for the world cup and instrumental in bringing the 2006 soccer championship to germany , berated klinsmann for skipping out of his duties as coach and a representative of the host country . bildunterschrift : soccer coaches for the participating countries of the world cup pose for photographers " he should have been here .
this is an obligatory meeting and he does not have all that many meetings that are obligatory , " beckenbauer told reporters and then added tersely : " i do n't want to say anything more about it because the more i think about it , the more drastic my choice of words will become . " the two-day gathering of world cup coaches had been planned for some time and was designed to give the officials a chance to discuss technical issues .
klinsmann 's assistants , oliver bierhoff and joachim löw , represented the german team . klinsmann in the spotlight klinsmann , who has been commuting between his native germany and his home in southern california since taking the job in august 2004 , has had to endure harsh criticism after his side 's embarrassing performance in italy last week .
the game , which was one of just a handful of pre-tournament friendlies , had been billed as key to testing germany 's skills .
instead it ended in a crushing 1-4 loss . many in the media and soccer world pinned the blame on klinsmann 's decision to stay based in the us ahead of the world cup .
several bundesliga coaches and german officials have argued that the national coach should be in germany to watch matches every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann during a practice at the stadio artemio franchi stadium in florence klinsmann has rejected the criticism .
" i was in gemrany for three of the last five weeks after the bundesliga started up after the winter break , " he told mass-circulation daily bild .
" i 've got my plan with everything necessary for the world cup preparations . " private interests should take back seat the 60-year-old beckenbauer , who lives just south of the german border in austria , has for the most part supported his younger colleague 's decisions and rarely criticized klinsmann in public .
but he said the national coach needed to show more presence in germany at the very least to calm the country 's nerves after the defeat in florence last week . " i do n't know how often i 've spoken with him and told him that he must be in germany during the final run-up to the tournament , " a visibly angry beckenbauer told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer expresses his frustration over klinsmann 's absence with only 94 days left before the world cup kicks off in june , klinsmann has very little time left to quell the fears of his critics – and their number is growing . on tuesday politicians from all sides of the spectrum joined the klinsmann bashing and attacked his plans to stay in california .
" there are only three months left before the start .
jürgen klinsmann belongs here in germany , " said detlef parr the sports expert for the opposition neo-liberal free democrats . " the national trainer would be well advised to come here , " added stephan mayer , the christian social union 's representative in the federal sporting commission .
" mr. klinsmann must now learn to push his private interests aside for the world cup . " interior minister lends support but klinsmann has at least one strong ally in the interior ministry , which is responsible for sports and ultimately for a successful world cup .
in an interview published in the bild newspaper on monday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended klinsmann and declared that the germany team " will not disappoint us . " he confessed that the german soccer federation " knew klinsmann would not be easy to handle , " but said he did not " believe in changing horses in the middle of the river .

its flagship vw brand is barely breaking even ; earnings and market share are evaporating in the all-important chinese market ; and union anger over pischetsrieder 's drastic belt-tightening plans could well cost the 58-year-old bavarian chairman his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder is very unpopular with the unions right now but pischetsrieder told vw 's annual earnings news conference that he was sticking to his guns regardless and he saw no reason to step down . " why should i step down ? " he asked .
" the debate about the extension of my contract does not belong in the public arena .
it 's a matter for the supervisory board , " pischetsrieder said . nevertheless , it was comments by the head of supervisory board ferdinand piech that sparked speculation about pischetsrieder 's future last week .
piech said it was an " open issue " whether pischetsrieder 's contract would be renewed since he did not have the backing of the labor representatives on the supervisory board . " no alternative " to restructuring pischetsrieder himself has acknowledged he is in a difficult position .
" my position has always been that you can only manage a company with the employees not against them , " he said . but he insisted he saw " no alternative " to the restructuring plans , under which up to 20,000 jobs were potentially on the line over the next three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a volkswagen " concept a " the car maker 's biggest problem remains the core vw brand .
the vw brand division as a whole was able to steer back to operating profit of 638 million in 2005 from a year-earlier loss of 25 million euros . but that was largely thanks to skoda and bentley , while volkswagen passenger cars were " just above operating break-even , " chief financial officer hans dieter poetsch complained . " further restructuring of this business is inevitable . " china a major headache another major headache is the key chinese market , where vw skidded into the red last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has run into trouble in china the development is of particular concern because china is the biggest market for the vw brand , even ahead of the home market of germany . once the number one car maker in china , vw has since lost that title to general motors . vw also faces difficulties in the us as a result of ferocious price competition from domestic rivals , as well as the weak dollar . it was such factors that caused pischetsrieder to describe vw 's 2005 results as " unsatisfactory " , despite a sharp rise in underlying profits last year . the car maker booked operating profit of 3.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- in 2005 , up 54.0 percent from the figure a year earlier .
vw 's bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros in 2005 on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros .
and total vehicle sales amounted to 5.243 million worldwide , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 . pischetsrieder predicted that underlying profits would improve this year , even if he steered clear of making a more concrete forecast . united we stand looking further ahead , pischetsrieder reiterated vw 's medium-term forecast for pre-tax profit of 5.1 billion euros for 2008 , up from 1.7 billion euros in 2005 . the chairman declined to quantify the financial fallout from the current leadership battle . but experts suggested it could be enormous .
" the power struggle between piech and pischetsrieder puts vw in a catastrophic position , " said ferdinand dudenhoefer , director of the center of automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " the public image is damaged , employees are frustrated and the restructuring is being blocked at key points , " dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle television . asked about speculation that the head of vw 's profitable luxury car arm audi , martin winterkorn , was vying to take over the driving seat at the parent company , pischetsrieder responded : " we wo n't let ourselves be divided up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's best germany ends nationwide pep talk germans gloomy about the future do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired ! germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 germany launches world cup charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are stiff and dour-faced germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be tough , but german students are determined to learn chinese english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time .

a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time . " if this mission is accomplished , it would demonstrate the eu 's resolve to get the country out of chaos and misery , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de congo deployment meets muted reponse in germany germany has so far shown little interest in sending peacekeepers to conflict-torn congo to reinforce un troops , suggesting it might step up its deployment in the balkans instead while france gets involved in africa .

a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .

its flagship vw brand is barely breaking even ; earnings and market share are evaporating in the all-important chinese market ; and union anger over pischetsrieder 's drastic belt-tightening plans could well cost the 58-year-old bavarian chairman his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder is very unpopular with the unions right now but pischetsrieder told vw 's annual earnings news conference that he was sticking to his guns regardless and he saw no reason to step down . " why should i step down ? " he asked .
" the debate about the extension of my contract does not belong in the public arena .
it 's a matter for the supervisory board , " pischetsrieder said . nevertheless , it was comments by the head of supervisory board ferdinand piech that sparked speculation about pischetsrieder 's future last week .
piech said it was an " open issue " whether pischetsrieder 's contract would be renewed since he did not have the backing of the labor representatives on the supervisory board . " no alternative " to restructuring pischetsrieder himself has acknowledged he is in a difficult position .
" my position has always been that you can only manage a company with the employees not against them , " he said . but he insisted he saw " no alternative " to the restructuring plans , under which up to 20,000 jobs were potentially on the line over the next three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a volkswagen " concept a " the car maker 's biggest problem remains the core vw brand .
the vw brand division as a whole was able to steer back to operating profit of 638 million in 2005 from a year-earlier loss of 25 million euros . but that was largely thanks to skoda and bentley , while volkswagen passenger cars were " just above operating break-even , " chief financial officer hans dieter poetsch complained . " further restructuring of this business is inevitable . " china a major headache another major headache is the key chinese market , where vw skidded into the red last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has run into trouble in china the development is of particular concern because china is the biggest market for the vw brand , even ahead of the home market of germany . once the number one car maker in china , vw has since lost that title to general motors . vw also faces difficulties in the us as a result of ferocious price competition from domestic rivals , as well as the weak dollar . it was such factors that caused pischetsrieder to describe vw 's 2005 results as " unsatisfactory " , despite a sharp rise in underlying profits last year . the car maker booked operating profit of 3.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- in 2005 , up 54.0 percent from the figure a year earlier .
vw 's bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros in 2005 on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros .
and total vehicle sales amounted to 5.243 million worldwide , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 . pischetsrieder predicted that underlying profits would improve this year , even if he steered clear of making a more concrete forecast . united we stand looking further ahead , pischetsrieder reiterated vw 's medium-term forecast for pre-tax profit of 5.1 billion euros for 2008 , up from 1.7 billion euros in 2005 . the chairman declined to quantify the financial fallout from the current leadership battle . but experts suggested it could be enormous .
" the power struggle between piech and pischetsrieder puts vw in a catastrophic position , " said ferdinand dudenhoefer , director of the center of automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " the public image is damaged , employees are frustrated and the restructuring is being blocked at key points , " dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle television . asked about speculation that the head of vw 's profitable luxury car arm audi , martin winterkorn , was vying to take over the driving seat at the parent company , pischetsrieder responded : " we wo n't let ourselves be divided up .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time . " if this mission is accomplished , it would demonstrate the eu 's resolve to get the country out of chaos and misery , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de congo deployment meets muted reponse in germany germany has so far shown little interest in sending peacekeepers to conflict-torn congo to reinforce un troops , suggesting it might step up its deployment in the balkans instead while france gets involved in africa .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time . " if this mission is accomplished , it would demonstrate the eu 's resolve to get the country out of chaos and misery , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de congo deployment meets muted reponse in germany germany has so far shown little interest in sending peacekeepers to conflict-torn congo to reinforce un troops , suggesting it might step up its deployment in the balkans instead while france gets involved in africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be tough , but german students are determined to learn chinese english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .

" but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time . " if this mission is accomplished , it would demonstrate the eu 's resolve to get the country out of chaos and misery , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de congo deployment meets muted reponse in germany germany has so far shown little interest in sending peacekeepers to conflict-torn congo to reinforce un troops , suggesting it might step up its deployment in the balkans instead while france gets involved in africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 german think tank says joblessness behind poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the standard of living has dropped in germany a german think tank has said that contrary to perception , relative poverty in germany is n't on the rise .
but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average .

the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

but his break from the glaring criticism was short-lived .
less than a week later , franz beckenbauer lashed out at the germany national coach for failing to attend a workshop of top officials from all 32 world cup finalists . " it 's incredible that he 's not here , " the self-proclaimed kaiser of german soccer said at a press conference in düsseldorf monday .
" as host country you have to be here .
nearly all the coaches are here .
carlos alberto parreira came from brazil , sven-goran eriksson came from england , but our head coach is not here . " beckenbauer , who is the president of germany 's organizing committee for the world cup and instrumental in bringing the 2006 soccer championship to germany , berated klinsmann for skipping out of his duties as coach and a representative of the host country . bildunterschrift : soccer coaches for the participating countries of the world cup pose for photographers " he should have been here .
this is an obligatory meeting and he does not have all that many meetings that are obligatory , " beckenbauer told reporters and then added tersely : " i do n't want to say anything more about it because the more i think about it , the more drastic my choice of words will become . " the two-day gathering of world cup coaches had been planned for some time and was designed to give the officials a chance to discuss technical issues .
klinsmann 's assistants , oliver bierhoff and joachim löw , represented the german team . klinsmann in the spotlight klinsmann , who has been commuting between his native germany and his home in southern california since taking the job in august 2004 , has had to endure harsh criticism after his side 's embarrassing performance in italy last week .
the game , which was one of just a handful of pre-tournament friendlies , had been billed as key to testing germany 's skills .
instead it ended in a crushing 1-4 loss . many in the media and soccer world pinned the blame on klinsmann 's decision to stay based in the us ahead of the world cup .
several bundesliga coaches and german officials have argued that the national coach should be in germany to watch matches every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann during a practice at the stadio artemio franchi stadium in florence klinsmann has rejected the criticism .
" i was in gemrany for three of the last five weeks after the bundesliga started up after the winter break , " he told mass-circulation daily bild .
" i 've got my plan with everything necessary for the world cup preparations . " private interests should take back seat the 60-year-old beckenbauer , who lives just south of the german border in austria , has for the most part supported his younger colleague 's decisions and rarely criticized klinsmann in public .
but he said the national coach needed to show more presence in germany at the very least to calm the country 's nerves after the defeat in florence last week . " i do n't know how often i 've spoken with him and told him that he must be in germany during the final run-up to the tournament , " a visibly angry beckenbauer told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer expresses his frustration over klinsmann 's absence with only 94 days left before the world cup kicks off in june , klinsmann has very little time left to quell the fears of his critics – and their number is growing . on tuesday politicians from all sides of the spectrum joined the klinsmann bashing and attacked his plans to stay in california .
" there are only three months left before the start .
jürgen klinsmann belongs here in germany , " said detlef parr the sports expert for the opposition neo-liberal free democrats . " the national trainer would be well advised to come here , " added stephan mayer , the christian social union 's representative in the federal sporting commission .
" mr. klinsmann must now learn to push his private interests aside for the world cup . " interior minister lends support but klinsmann has at least one strong ally in the interior ministry , which is responsible for sports and ultimately for a successful world cup .
in an interview published in the bild newspaper on monday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended klinsmann and declared that the germany team " will not disappoint us . " he confessed that the german soccer federation " knew klinsmann would not be easy to handle , " but said he did not " believe in changing horses in the middle of the river .

a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time .

a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .

its flagship vw brand is barely breaking even ; earnings and market share are evaporating in the all-important chinese market ; and union anger over pischetsrieder 's drastic belt-tightening plans could well cost the 58-year-old bavarian chairman his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder is very unpopular with the unions right now but pischetsrieder told vw 's annual earnings news conference that he was sticking to his guns regardless and he saw no reason to step down . " why should i step down ? " he asked .
" the debate about the extension of my contract does not belong in the public arena .
it 's a matter for the supervisory board , " pischetsrieder said . nevertheless , it was comments by the head of supervisory board ferdinand piech that sparked speculation about pischetsrieder 's future last week .
piech said it was an " open issue " whether pischetsrieder 's contract would be renewed since he did not have the backing of the labor representatives on the supervisory board . " no alternative " to restructuring pischetsrieder himself has acknowledged he is in a difficult position .
" my position has always been that you can only manage a company with the employees not against them , " he said . but he insisted he saw " no alternative " to the restructuring plans , under which up to 20,000 jobs were potentially on the line over the next three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a volkswagen " concept a " the car maker 's biggest problem remains the core vw brand .
the vw brand division as a whole was able to steer back to operating profit of 638 million in 2005 from a year-earlier loss of 25 million euros . but that was largely thanks to skoda and bentley , while volkswagen passenger cars were " just above operating break-even , " chief financial officer hans dieter poetsch complained . " further restructuring of this business is inevitable . " china a major headache another major headache is the key chinese market , where vw skidded into the red last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has run into trouble in china the development is of particular concern because china is the biggest market for the vw brand , even ahead of the home market of germany . once the number one car maker in china , vw has since lost that title to general motors . vw also faces difficulties in the us as a result of ferocious price competition from domestic rivals , as well as the weak dollar . it was such factors that caused pischetsrieder to describe vw 's 2005 results as " unsatisfactory " , despite a sharp rise in underlying profits last year . the car maker booked operating profit of 3.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- in 2005 , up 54.0 percent from the figure a year earlier .
vw 's bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros in 2005 on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros .
and total vehicle sales amounted to 5.243 million worldwide , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 . pischetsrieder predicted that underlying profits would improve this year , even if he steered clear of making a more concrete forecast . united we stand looking further ahead , pischetsrieder reiterated vw 's medium-term forecast for pre-tax profit of 5.1 billion euros for 2008 , up from 1.7 billion euros in 2005 . the chairman declined to quantify the financial fallout from the current leadership battle . but experts suggested it could be enormous .
" the power struggle between piech and pischetsrieder puts vw in a catastrophic position , " said ferdinand dudenhoefer , director of the center of automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " the public image is damaged , employees are frustrated and the restructuring is being blocked at key points , " dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle television . asked about speculation that the head of vw 's profitable luxury car arm audi , martin winterkorn , was vying to take over the driving seat at the parent company , pischetsrieder responded : " we wo n't let ourselves be divided up .

but his break from the glaring criticism was short-lived .
less than a week later , franz beckenbauer lashed out at the germany national coach for failing to attend a workshop of top officials from all 32 world cup finalists . " it 's incredible that he 's not here , " the self-proclaimed kaiser of german soccer said at a press conference in düsseldorf monday .
" as host country you have to be here .
nearly all the coaches are here .
carlos alberto parreira came from brazil , sven-goran eriksson came from england , but our head coach is not here . " beckenbauer , who is the president of germany 's organizing committee for the world cup and instrumental in bringing the 2006 soccer championship to germany , berated klinsmann for skipping out of his duties as coach and a representative of the host country . bildunterschrift : soccer coaches for the participating countries of the world cup pose for photographers " he should have been here .
this is an obligatory meeting and he does not have all that many meetings that are obligatory , " beckenbauer told reporters and then added tersely : " i do n't want to say anything more about it because the more i think about it , the more drastic my choice of words will become . " the two-day gathering of world cup coaches had been planned for some time and was designed to give the officials a chance to discuss technical issues .
klinsmann 's assistants , oliver bierhoff and joachim löw , represented the german team . klinsmann in the spotlight klinsmann , who has been commuting between his native germany and his home in southern california since taking the job in august 2004 , has had to endure harsh criticism after his side 's embarrassing performance in italy last week .
the game , which was one of just a handful of pre-tournament friendlies , had been billed as key to testing germany 's skills .
instead it ended in a crushing 1-4 loss . many in the media and soccer world pinned the blame on klinsmann 's decision to stay based in the us ahead of the world cup .
several bundesliga coaches and german officials have argued that the national coach should be in germany to watch matches every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann during a practice at the stadio artemio franchi stadium in florence klinsmann has rejected the criticism .
" i was in gemrany for three of the last five weeks after the bundesliga started up after the winter break , " he told mass-circulation daily bild .
" i 've got my plan with everything necessary for the world cup preparations .

but his break from the glaring criticism was short-lived .
less than a week later , franz beckenbauer lashed out at the germany national coach for failing to attend a workshop of top officials from all 32 world cup finalists . " it 's incredible that he 's not here , " the self-proclaimed kaiser of german soccer said at a press conference in düsseldorf monday .
" as host country you have to be here .
nearly all the coaches are here .
carlos alberto parreira came from brazil , sven-goran eriksson came from england , but our head coach is not here . " beckenbauer , who is the president of germany 's organizing committee for the world cup and instrumental in bringing the 2006 soccer championship to germany , berated klinsmann for skipping out of his duties as coach and a representative of the host country . bildunterschrift : soccer coaches for the participating countries of the world cup pose for photographers " he should have been here .
this is an obligatory meeting and he does not have all that many meetings that are obligatory , " beckenbauer told reporters and then added tersely : " i do n't want to say anything more about it because the more i think about it , the more drastic my choice of words will become . " the two-day gathering of world cup coaches had been planned for some time and was designed to give the officials a chance to discuss technical issues .
klinsmann 's assistants , oliver bierhoff and joachim löw , represented the german team . klinsmann in the spotlight klinsmann , who has been commuting between his native germany and his home in southern california since taking the job in august 2004 , has had to endure harsh criticism after his side 's embarrassing performance in italy last week .
the game , which was one of just a handful of pre-tournament friendlies , had been billed as key to testing germany 's skills .
instead it ended in a crushing 1-4 loss . many in the media and soccer world pinned the blame on klinsmann 's decision to stay based in the us ahead of the world cup .
several bundesliga coaches and german officials have argued that the national coach should be in germany to watch matches every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann during a practice at the stadio artemio franchi stadium in florence klinsmann has rejected the criticism .
" i was in gemrany for three of the last five weeks after the bundesliga started up after the winter break , " he told mass-circulation daily bild .
" i 've got my plan with everything necessary for the world cup preparations . " private interests should take back seat the 60-year-old beckenbauer , who lives just south of the german border in austria , has for the most part supported his younger colleague 's decisions and rarely criticized klinsmann in public .

" and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average .

the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's best germany ends nationwide pep talk germans gloomy about the future do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired ! germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 germany launches world cup charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are stiff and dour-faced germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time . " if this mission is accomplished , it would demonstrate the eu 's resolve to get the country out of chaos and misery , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de congo deployment meets muted reponse in germany germany has so far shown little interest in sending peacekeepers to conflict-torn congo to reinforce un troops , suggesting it might step up its deployment in the balkans instead while france gets involved in africa .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades . " we were all in agreement that eu representative -lrb- javier -rrb- solana should go to kinshasa soon to firm up details of what is needed , " jung told reporters after almost two hours of talks on the congo mission with his eu counterparts . berlin to lead ? however , with a few more weeks for the details to be ironed out , solana was confident on monday that a small force would be deployed in time for the june 18 poll .
he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .
" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation . " we think this mission should be concentrated on kinshasa , " he said , adding that " we believe it should run for about four months to see us through the elections and for the government to be formed . " landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck . " normally it will not be necessary to use the force , " solana said .
" we are talking about 1,000 -lrb- troops -rrb- over the horizon in case of need . " he suggested the contingent would be based in one of the drc 's neighbors . " over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time .

its flagship vw brand is barely breaking even ; earnings and market share are evaporating in the all-important chinese market ; and union anger over pischetsrieder 's drastic belt-tightening plans could well cost the 58-year-old bavarian chairman his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder is very unpopular with the unions right now but pischetsrieder told vw 's annual earnings news conference that he was sticking to his guns regardless and he saw no reason to step down . " why should i step down ? " he asked .
" the debate about the extension of my contract does not belong in the public arena .
it 's a matter for the supervisory board , " pischetsrieder said . nevertheless , it was comments by the head of supervisory board ferdinand piech that sparked speculation about pischetsrieder 's future last week .
piech said it was an " open issue " whether pischetsrieder 's contract would be renewed since he did not have the backing of the labor representatives on the supervisory board . " no alternative " to restructuring pischetsrieder himself has acknowledged he is in a difficult position .
" my position has always been that you can only manage a company with the employees not against them , " he said . but he insisted he saw " no alternative " to the restructuring plans , under which up to 20,000 jobs were potentially on the line over the next three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a volkswagen " concept a " the car maker 's biggest problem remains the core vw brand .
the vw brand division as a whole was able to steer back to operating profit of 638 million in 2005 from a year-earlier loss of 25 million euros . but that was largely thanks to skoda and bentley , while volkswagen passenger cars were " just above operating break-even , " chief financial officer hans dieter poetsch complained . " further restructuring of this business is inevitable . " china a major headache another major headache is the key chinese market , where vw skidded into the red last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has run into trouble in china the development is of particular concern because china is the biggest market for the vw brand , even ahead of the home market of germany . once the number one car maker in china , vw has since lost that title to general motors . vw also faces difficulties in the us as a result of ferocious price competition from domestic rivals , as well as the weak dollar . it was such factors that caused pischetsrieder to describe vw 's 2005 results as " unsatisfactory " , despite a sharp rise in underlying profits last year . the car maker booked operating profit of 3.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- in 2005 , up 54.0 percent from the figure a year earlier .
vw 's bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros in 2005 on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros .
and total vehicle sales amounted to 5.243 million worldwide , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 . pischetsrieder predicted that underlying profits would improve this year , even if he steered clear of making a more concrete forecast . united we stand looking further ahead , pischetsrieder reiterated vw 's medium-term forecast for pre-tax profit of 5.1 billion euros for 2008 , up from 1.7 billion euros in 2005 . the chairman declined to quantify the financial fallout from the current leadership battle . but experts suggested it could be enormous .
" the power struggle between piech and pischetsrieder puts vw in a catastrophic position , " said ferdinand dudenhoefer , director of the center of automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " the public image is damaged , employees are frustrated and the restructuring is being blocked at key points , " dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle television . asked about speculation that the head of vw 's profitable luxury car arm audi , martin winterkorn , was vying to take over the driving seat at the parent company , pischetsrieder responded : " we wo n't let ourselves be divided up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's best germany ends nationwide pep talk germans gloomy about the future do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired ! germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 germany launches world cup charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are stiff and dour-faced germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .

" my führer - the really true truth about adolf hitler " is billed as a parody of the hit german drama " der untergang " -lrb- downfall -rrb- about the nazi leader 's last days , but this time featuring a sniveling hitler wallowing in his defeats . its swiss director , dani levy , 48 , is an established filmmaker best known for the first german jewish comedy since world war ii , " alles auf zucker " -lrb- go for zucker -rrb- , which was a critical success in germany and abroad in 2004 . a shaggy-haired comedian famous for his gag hit " litter box , " helge schneider , has been enlisted to play the führer in the film , whose release date had not yet been announced .

if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force . at a meeting of eu ministers in innsbruck , austria , on tuesday , countries hesitated to pledge troops to a mission to help safeguard june elections in the drc , instead calling for more details on what the mission will entail . german defense minister franz-josef jung said that the ministers had failed to make progress on the mission , which has been requested by the united nations to help the drc through its first free elections in over four decades .

" germany can not commit to sending 1,500 soldiers . " jung also set conditions on germany 's participation .

" landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck .

a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 german think tank says joblessness behind poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the standard of living has dropped in germany a german think tank has said that contrary to perception , relative poverty in germany is n't on the rise .
but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

the islamic republic had consistently claimed that it was seeking only nuclear-generated electricity , not weapons . " i am still very much hopeful that in the next week or so an agreement could be reached , " elbaradei told reporters , while acknowledging that russia 's proposal to enrich uranium for iran outside its borders had snagged on tehran 's determination to purify nuclear fuel itself . enrichment will continue , says tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if iran agrees to a pause , its enrichment program is " irreversible " however , despite the ray of hope , javad vaeedi , deputy secretary of iran 's national security council , insisted that enrichment " research and development " in iran was irreversible . " iran is ready to compromise on the period of suspension -lrb- of large-scale enrichment -rrb- , if it can keep its nuclear research activities , " the diplomat close to the iran-eu talks said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defiant ahead of iaea meeting iran will not freeze sensitive nuclear " research " work even if it is hauled before the un security council , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani said sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's best germany ends nationwide pep talk germans gloomy about the future do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired ! germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 germany launches world cup charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are stiff and dour-faced germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

he suggested that germany would be the likely leader . " i think germany is very appropriate for this kind of mission , " he said . jung has yet to confirm comments from solana and other ministers about a leadership role for germany , but if berlin does take the lead , chances are the mission will be small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz-josef jung " we have always said very clearly that it must be a combined european effort , there must be a fair distribution , " said jung .

" landmark elections starting in mid-june , the drc is scheduled to hold presidential , local , provincial and legislative elections as it emerges from a war that has killed some 4 million people since 1998 and left 1.6 million others homeless . solana said the eu force would be based close to but not inside the conflict-ridden country , which is making a slow transition toward democracy with the help of the un . " it 's a force that has the character of a deterrent force around the time of the elections , " he told reporters at innsbruck .

" over the horizon can not be a thousand kilometers away , " solana said , " it has to be close enough so that it does n't take three months to deploy . " the eu mission is also of importance to the bloc itself , as it tries to create a defense identity distinct from nato . in brussels , the head of the eu 's election observation mission in the drc , retired general philippe morillon , said it was important to help ensure the polls get underway on time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be tough , but german students are determined to learn chinese english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows . while " ¿ cómo estás ? " is still often heard in foreign language classrooms in german schools , these days some students are choosing to begin their lessons with a friendly " ni hao ma ? " and those numbers look to be increasing . while chinese is not yet squeezing spanish out of its place in the curriculum , the language of the middle kingdom has been added to the course offerings of about 80 schools in germany , with more planning to begin teaching the language spoken by some 1.3 billion people on the planet . " a lot of young people who begin taking the language say they are doing it for work , " said li rong , who teaches her native tongue at the chinese center in hanover .
" they hope that in the future , if they can speak chinese , they have better luck finding work . " exotic , but why bother ? up until a little over a decade ago , chinese was considered by many to be an exotic and perhaps interesting language , but one which offered little practical benefit , and was seen as too impenetrable .
but as china 's reforms , begun in 1978 , began to accelerate after 1993 , chinese has taken on a new attractiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's vast cities are growing at record rates thanks to the booming economy now , with an economy which grew to the world 's fourth largest in 2005 - just behind germany 's - and a market of over a billion consumers , china is a rising economic superpower .
the world bank estimates that china will overtake the us as the world 's economic leader by the year 2020 . chinese , spoken in some form by one-fifth of the world 's population , has gained new status around the world , and german schools have begun to recognize that the economic future might partially be written in characters . " the idea that chinese is important is slowly gathering force , " said tim glaser , director of the german-chinese economic association .
" a few years ago , students could only take chinese privately or on the side , but now schools are offering it as a regular subject . " interest is there at a few schools in germany , such as the annette von droste hülshoff secondary school in münster , in the state of north rhine-westphalia , students preparing for college can choose mandarin chinese -lrb- china 's main dialect -rrb- as their primary subject . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese at the annette von droste hülshoff school in münster three years ago , the school was the first to begin such a program , and administrators were initially concerned about what level of interest they would find among students .
they offered a short introductory course to get students acquainted with the subject and worked in conjunction with other schools to make sure they had enough students to fill a class . " but now it 's developed so well , our own students fill the courses , which now run right alongside spanish or french , " said bärbel dahlhaus , the school 's deputy director .
" we think a lot of other schools in north rhine-westphalia are interested in adding chinese .
we get a lot of inquiries about the program . " she said students who emerge with a knowledge of chinese will have an advantage that could improve their chances in germany 's tight labor market . " i think that reason is even more important to the parents then it is to the students themselves , " she said . just a trend ? exact statistics are hard to come by about the number of schools offering chinese and the rate of growth , partly because germany 's educational system is administered on the state level and , while some schools offer chinese as central part of the core curriculum , others offer it on a casual basis or as an elective .
estimates run from around 80 schools , according to the fachverband chinesisch , an association of chinese language groups , to more than 150 counted by the chinese embassy in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese teaching materials , once a rarity , are now becoming more common " it 's slowly picking up , and as long as china 's economy keeps performing as it has been , the numbers will keep rising , " said rüdiger breuer , a lecturer at the east asia studies department at the ruhr university at bochum .
" but i 'm convinced that as soon as an economic recession comes along , the numbers will go down again . " he points to the japanese phenomenon the 1980s , when interest in that language peaked as japan 's economy throttled ahead of everyone else .
but when japan entered its long state of malaise in the 1990s , interest in japan sagged along with its economy .
russia experienced a time of being en vogue in the 1990s , as its own turbocharged economy rocketed skyward .
but as its jets cooled , so did russian mania . germany lagging while germany is waking up to the importance of teaching chinese to the business movers and shakers of tomorrow , they 've been slumbering a little longer than their neighbors .
france is further ahead , with some 200 schools that offer chinese .
in britain , it 's already a requirement at some schools .
at brighton college in east sussex , all students between 13 and 18 must take mandarin , in addition to latin , french or spanish . the school 's director , richard cairns , decided on the requirement when china replaced the uk as the world 's fourth biggest economy .
" one of my most important tasks is to make students ready for the 21st century , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the continuing popularity of chinese largely depends on the continuing strength of china 's economy , experts say .
some 300 schools in britain have exchange programs with china and predictions are that in three years , more students will take university preparation exams in chinese than in spanish . wulff rehfus , director of a high school in düsseldorf , also called the annette von droste hülshoff school , says he realizes that germany has some catching up to do and that there are too few schools offering the language right now .
he 's hoping that will change , and is doing his part by introducing chinese in his own classrooms this october . " it looks like china in the foreseeable future will overtake europe economically , " he said .
" it 's a good idea for europeans to learn chinese , because even when the topic is economics , it 's good to know something about the mentality of the people and their culture when doing business with them . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british students say ' nein danke ' to german lessons when it comes to learning languages , britain is bottom of the class - and germany 's outgoing ambassador to britain thinks the younger generation will pay for its linguistic ineptitude .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's best germany ends nationwide pep talk germans gloomy about the future do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired ! germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 germany launches world cup charm offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are stiff and dour-faced germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face . twenty thousand posters went up around germany on tuesday as part of a charm campaign to present germany as a welcoming nation of relaxed , joyful people to soccer fans from all over the world ahead of the world cup , which will be played in 12 german cities from june 9 to july 9 . " we are unfortunately not perceived as a particularly friendly people , " world cup organizing committee president franz beckenbauer told a press conference in berlin signaling the start of the campaign .
" we have to improve on that . " the national service and friendliness campaign - an initiative of the fifa german world cup organization committee and the german tourist board will last three months and cost three million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- .
it is funded by the german government .
in addition to an official poster , it includes a 30-second television advertisement which shows smiling germans from all walks of life rolling out red carpets under the trademarked slogan " a time to meet friends . " a surreal experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a time to make friends " the poster and the tv ad paint a dream vision of an elated country .
they include a bizarre selection of the familiar and the unrecognizable : an extraordinarily peppy , dancing bavarian in lederhosen ; a bright and breezy police officer ; a mildly seductive , rose-cheeked chamber maid ; and an overeager medical worker waving a full syringe at her unsuspecting country-mates .
the days of " where 's waldo ? " are definitely over .
the time is ripe for " where 's your german friend ? " instead . it was a telling sign that officials chose to host the press conference for the launch of the gregarious campaign at one of the most prestigious addresses in berlin - the stylish hotel adlon , a place in which friendliness is exaggerated to the point of embarrassment as a matter of daily routine . it is literally impossible to meet an unfriendly person at the adlon because the five-star hotel , which is located a stone 's throw away from the brandenburg gate , does n't have much to do with everday germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of a smile is very high at the adlon it is a place in which the stilettos of heavily-accessorized women silently sink into the plush carpets while cultivated businessmen meander through the muffled halls with statesmanlike elegance .
it is a place in which the coat check lady practically apologizes to you when you tell her you 've lost your token , whereafter she gleefully dives into a pool of coats to look for your jacket as if she was fishing for the most exquisite pearl at the bottom of the sea . appropriately enough , it is a place in which you are almost led to believe that germany is presiding over the international axis of cosmopolitan friendliness .
but if german reality resembled a luxurious hotel , the country probably would n't need a multimillion dollar friendliness campaign in the first place . no sour faces allowed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel : a new chancellor for a new germany advertising friendliness is not merely an exercise in wishful thinking .
it is a way to encourage the german service industry to transform itself into an even more profitable bundle of joy .
it is also a delicate attempt at " sensitizing the -lrb- german -rrb- population to their role as hosts , " as petra hedorfer , president of the german tourist board said . aside from the fact that " sensitizing the population " unnecessarily makes the germans sound autistic and pharmaceutically needy , the daunting task of the campaign is to dispel prejudices that foreigners living in the country have been accumulating about germans - too serious , obsessively disciplined and pretty much rude - for centuries . " my wife told me to start by not making a sinister face here , " said german minister for economy and technology michael glos . sporting mega events like the world cup inspire the travel industry to see itself as a cross-cultural humanitarian relief project .
yet the bottom line remains : wooing foreigners is tempting when one knows that they spend 27 billion euros a year in germany .
this is why glos described the world cup as " legal doping for tourism . " please come back ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the face that his wife has warned him about : economics minister michael glos glos said the aim was not only to impress the up to three million people expected to come to germany for the world cup , but to encourage as many of them as possible to return in the future . the german police has started giving 50,000 officers assigned to world cup duties basic english courses to help them to communicate with fans .
they are learning polite stock phrases like " it 's a pleasure " and " you 're welcome . " the tourism board has prepared customized packages for taxi companies , hotels , airports , stations , restaurants and travel agents to give them tips on how to deal with foreigners more impressively .
the kits sell for 39 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- each and include stickers and posters that would designate that particular company as one trained in world cup hospitality . fedor radmann , tourism advisor for the world cup organizing committee , said however , that the goal of the host country should not be to strive for perfection , but rather to surprise and delight the visitors . " somebody 's experience of a country is not based on one incident , but on 10 small ones , " he said .
" so we have to surprise people .
they do not think that germans can do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2006 german think tank says joblessness behind poverty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the standard of living has dropped in germany a german think tank has said that contrary to perception , relative poverty in germany is n't on the rise .
but it blamed unemployment for a general drop in living standards . the cologne institute for the german economy said 16 percent of the population in europe 's biggest economy was poor , earning less than 60 percent of the country 's average net income of 938 euros -lrb- $ 1,127 -rrb- per month . the institute said the number of people living below the poverty line in 2004 was 3.7 percent higher than in 1999 , which was the lowest level since the institute began keeping records for reunified germany in 1991 . at the same time , the institute raised questions over german indicators for measuring poverty , saying they were substantially flawed . the " typically poor person " today has 6 percent more real income than five years ago , said michael hüther , head of the think tank , on monday .
the theory that the poor were getting poorer was wrong , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless in munich according to german standards , people are considered poor if they earn less than 60 percent of average monthly wages .
at the moment this would be about 600 euros per month . society getting richer rolf kroker , also of the cologne institute for the german economy , argued that this could mean that the number of people considered poor could indeed rise , although society as a whole was getting richer . " it could happen that all incomes increase , all people are better off , and we can not see a reduction in poverty .
poverty could even increase if the higher incomes improve faster than the lower incomes , " koker said . he explained that this was exactly what happened over the past seven years .
according to a government report , poverty increased from 12.1 percent in 1998 to 13.5 percent in 2003 .
at the same time germany 's wealthiest 10 percent increased their share of income substantially . in spite of the public outcry that this report has caused , kroker said germans are still faring very well compared with their european union neighbors , especially in the poverty-prone sectors of the population . " we are quite good because poverty among younger people is below average , and also among elderly people poverty is far below the average . " joblessness the main culprit the institute singled out unemployment as the main reason for the drop in living standards , in particular long-term unemployment which afflicts 3.5 percent of the country 's eligible work force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for work at a munich job center the number of unemployed in germany rose back above 5 million in february , equivalent to a rate of 12.2 percent , dampening hopes of a long-awaited labor market upswing . the institute said being joblessness had a far more negative impact on people 's lives than a mere lack of money .
the long-term jobless perceived their lives as less satisfying than those who had jobs but lived below the poverty line , and the longer they remained out of the work , the smaller their chances of finding a new job became . " even those who are unemployed but whose income is above the poverty line are less satisfied with their lives than the working poor , " the institute said . " far more alarming than the increase in relative poverty in germany is the fact that 3.5 percent of the workforce has been unemployed for more than 24 months , " it added .
it is on this front that the fight against poverty should be waged . " long-term jobless the problem kroker said the group of long-term unemployed is disproportionately higher in germany than in other european countries , making job creation absolutely essential in the fight against poverty . chancellor angela merkel is planning to introduce a national minimum wage to stem the growing tide of the so-called working poor who do not earn living wages in their jobs as well as consider state-sponsored wage subsidies . but the measures , according to koker , will do little to alleviate the situation . " we do n't think this is a good way , and in connection with fighting poverty , the wrong instrument .
if we want to reduce poverty we need to have more economic growth and more employment , " koker said . " to some extent we also need to reduce welfare benefits as a way to increase the incentives to take up work and so reduce poverty in the long run .

next year it will become britain 's gateway to europe , a 24-hour international arrival point - thanks to the new channel tunnel rail link terminus at st pancras .
and draft £ 2bn plans to transform more than 67 acres of former railway land - one of europe 's biggest inner city development sites - go before camden council this week .
modern flats and play areas could be housed inside the iron rings of the huge gas holders , a reminder of king 's cross 's industrial heritage .
by 2020 new streets , parks , offices , shops , restaurants could be built on a site stretching north from st pancras and king 's cross stations up to the islington border .
planning-wise , the area is not without problems - criss-crossed with railway lines and the regent 's canal .
' deprived area ' " it 's a big hole in the fabric -lsb- of the area -rsb- ... the railway lines are a barrier , " said the council 's man in charge of overseeing the project , bob west .
" the surrounding populations and pieces of land are a bit fragmented , and there are levels of deprivation . "
mr west 's team have sent out consultation leaflets to 30,000 homes - twice .
more than 300 community groups have been contacted and planning briefs have been worked out with neighbouring islington council .
if all goes to plan , detailed planning applications could be submitted by christmas .
the culross building is one of those which could be bulldozed there 's so much interest , councillors are to examine the draft plans over two days , on 8 and 9 march , to allow various deputations to have their say .
but not everyone is pleased with the plans as they stand .
the king 's cross conservation area advisory committee -lrb- kccaac -rrb- , a small group of volunteers , have raised £ 750 and called in some favours to produce their own report .
they say opening up the canal walls will shatter the tranquillity of a towpath now used almost exclusively by cyclists , joggers and herons .
and they fear huge office blocks will overshadow the area 's victorian heritage , that historic stations and old buildings will be bulldozed , and an " office world " created south of the canal .
how is it king 's cross anymore if it 's just a bunch of offices like you would get anywhere ? "
rupert perry spokesman rupert perry 's main priority will be saving the unlisted 1890s culross building which sits at right angles to the developer 's proposed line of offices .
its 40 or so flats look shabby now , with broken windows and stained bricks , but mr perry thinks it has great potential .
" they could easily be converted back , either for fancy housing , or social housing , " he said .

in the three months to february sales growth slowed to 0.9 % , down from 1.1 % in the three months to january .
like-for-like sales rose by just 0.6 % in february against the previous year , and this followed a weak february 2005 when sales fell 0.3 % .
the brc said there was a " continuing squeeze on consumer spending " .
costs rising " contrary to the bank of england 's expectations , there is no sign of an upturn , " said brc director general kevin hawkins .
" reports of a recovery in the housing market have yet to work through to the big-ticket categories , which have been depressed for the past 15 months .
" meanwhile the industry 's fixed-cost base continues to rise well above the general rate of inflation .
" shop price inflation , in contrast , remains around zero . "
valentine 's effect however , with the like-for-like figure showing an increase , february 's figures represents the fourth straight month of like-for-like growth , a trend not seen since october 2004 .
but head of retail at kpmg - which helps to compile the survey figures - helen dickinson said retailers faced a cost base that was growing faster than the sales rate .
according to the brc , spring and summer clothing ranges have yet to start selling in any volume , with footfall down and " consumers still in a winter mindset " .
however , valentine 's day gave a boost to sales of lingerie as well as chocolates , wine and champagne .

baby mb , who can not be named , has spinal muscular atrophy - a genetic condition which leads to almost total paralysis - and can not breathe unaided .
doctors treating the 17-month-old say it is in his best interests to withdraw ventilation and to let him die .
but his family says he has a reasonable quality of life and should stay alive .
they feel he can recognise and respond to them , and that he gains enjoyment from spending time with his family .
an injunction reporting any details of the case has been lifted after an application by the bbc , but none of the parties involved can be identified .
we are hopeful we can persuade the court that his quality of life is good enough so that treatment should not be withdrawn baby mb 's mother a medic known only as dr s told the court one had to consider the baby 's inability to express his wishes , move or show if he is in any pain or distress .
when questioned by caroline harry thomas , counsel for the children and family court advisory support service , representing the child 's interests , he said : " i think the cumulative effect of all this is that he has an intolerable life . "
the doctor said the child would have to live through a period in which he was unable to open his eyes , if the current treatment regime continued .
he would need them opened manually to be able to see , he added .
baby mb has also been wearing splints on his hands and feet intermittently , which caused discomfort , and a risk of limb fractures would develop in relation to normal handling .
' difficult position ' charles foster , counsel for the family , asked dr s whether he thought the hospital 's application to remove ventilation was premature .
dr s said he disagreed , replying : " i would actually say that it could be seen as an application that is later than it should have been . "
the child 's neurologist , also known only as dr s , was asked by the judge whether he would regard it as acceptable medically and ethically to continue ventilation but not to resuscitate should the child go into collapse .
he said continuing the specific treatment would not be in the child 's best interests .
" if you ask me personally whether i could continue it , i would say i would find it difficult , because i have been feeling that what i have been doing as a doctor has been wrong for many months , which is a very difficult position for me to be in .
' not normal ' " that is not just my opinion , but the opinion of many medical professionals who are directly involved in his care , " he added .
he also said he would find it very difficult to attempt resuscitation if he was asked to on the child but that it was " a very difficult dilemma " .
dr s also claimed baby mb did not have the cognitive features normally seen in children with this type of spinal muscular atrophy .
he said in his view , mb 's cognitive function " does not appear normal " , but it was impossible to assess because of the baby 's inability to respond .
dr s also said he was not aware of a similar child being ventilated in the uk .
genetic disorder the judge then asked if there was a danger that one might terminate his life when he was content and getting pleasure out of life .
dr s responded that although he had no way of assessing it , he said he could n't say absolutely that he did not have periods of pleasure .
" i still would say that in my assessment , the potential disbenefits outweigh the potential benefits .
our interventions i would n't regard as pleasurable . "
last week , mr justice holman who is hearing the case , said it could be a landmark one as it was the first time a court had been asked to make a life or death ruling on a child who has near or full cognitive function .
his incurable condition , which affects one in 6,400 newborns , is set to lead to almost full paralysis .
it is a recessive genetic condition passed to a baby when both its parents carry a certain gene .
the case will continue until tuesday .

dr s said he disagreed , replying : " i would actually say that it could be seen as an application that is later than it should have been . "
the child 's neurologist , also known only as dr s , was asked by the judge whether he would regard it as acceptable medically and ethically to continue ventilation but not to resuscitate should the child go into collapse .
he said continuing the specific treatment would not be in the child 's best interests .

he also said he would find it very difficult to attempt resuscitation if he was asked to on the child but that it was " a very difficult dilemma " .
dr s also claimed baby mb did not have the cognitive features normally seen in children with this type of spinal muscular atrophy .
he said in his view , mb 's cognitive function " does not appear normal " , but it was impossible to assess because of the baby 's inability to respond .

it is a recessive genetic condition passed to a baby when both its parents carry a certain gene .

baby mb , who can not be named , has spinal muscular atrophy - a genetic condition which leads to almost total paralysis - and can not breathe unaided .
doctors treating the 17-month-old say it is in his best interests to withdraw ventilation and to let him die .
but his family says he has a reasonable quality of life and should stay alive .
they feel he can recognise and respond to them , and that he gains enjoyment from spending time with his family .
an injunction reporting any details of the case has been lifted after an application by the bbc , but none of the parties involved can be identified .
we are hopeful we can persuade the court that his quality of life is good enough so that treatment should not be withdrawn baby mb 's mother a medic known only as dr s told the court one had to consider the baby 's inability to express his wishes , move or show if he is in any pain or distress .
when questioned by caroline harry thomas , counsel for the children and family court advisory support service , representing the child 's interests , he said : " i think the cumulative effect of all this is that he has an intolerable life . "
the doctor said the child would have to live through a period in which he was unable to open his eyes , if the current treatment regime continued .
he would need them opened manually to be able to see , he added .
baby mb has also been wearing splints on his hands and feet intermittently , which caused discomfort , and a risk of limb fractures would develop in relation to normal handling .
' difficult position ' charles foster , counsel for the family , asked dr s whether he thought the hospital 's application to remove ventilation was premature .

research by bbc wales ' week in week out found half of councils already collect waste every two weeks , or plan to , and five others are thinking about it .
it is designed to encourage recycling .
households would be limited to one wheelie bin of rubbish per fortnight , with recycled waste collected weekly .
but tory am lisa francis said it could create " serious hygiene problems " .
the assembly government has set targets on recycling for local authorities to meet in order to reduce the amount of rubbish being sent to landfill sites .
you just put it in the bins , and you do n't really think where it goes at all mandy price , newport resident councils have been asked to ensure 25 % of rubbish is recycled by 2007 and 40 % by 2010 .
authorities that do not reach these targets will be fined .
every year , 4m tonnes of rubbish is buried in wales , but many landfill sites are now full .
fortnightly collection of rubbish would be combined with " doorstep " collection of recycled waste , including paper , glass and tins .
newport was one of the first councils in wales to switch to limit householders to one wheelie bin of rubbish per fortnight - but two boxes of recycled waste are collected every week .
the authority said the move had increased recycling by over 40 % , but some residents have objected to the scheme .
mother-of-five mandy price , who fills over 20 bin bags a week and does not recycle any rubbish , said she could not cope with the restriction .
newport council has seen a 40 % increase in recycling she told week in week out : " it 's a pain really ...
i do n't see why they just do n't come once a week , " adding : " you just put it in the bins , and you do n't really think where it goes at all . "
newport council said it was necessary to put pressure on people to encourage them to recycle more .
the authority said it had not seen a significant increase in fly-tipping after starting the scheme - and the household rubbish that was dumped often contained items which could be recycled .
friends of the earth cymru director julian rosser said he would like to see more councils encouraging recycling .
he said : " what we really want to see is for recycling to be made as easy as throwing away rubbish - a lot of people have no doorstep recycling at all .
" it 's always a worry that people might be tempted to dump rubbish but i do n't feel many people will need to do that ... as people recycle more and more their bin bags will shrink . "
lisa francis , a mid and west wales conservative am , said the current situation was " unsustainable and is damaging our beautiful environment " .
but she said : " however , i am concerned that collecting rubbish once every two weeks could pose serious hygiene problems , with rubbish left for fester for long periods of time , especially around bank holidays .
" it is particularly concerning in university towns like lampeter and aberystwyth , as rubbish collection is already a serious issue when students go off on their end of term breaks .
" many hotels , restaurants and other businesses do not have adequate storage for a fortnight 's worth of commercial waste and nor should they . "

"
there was a buzz in the internet community last week after the people 's daily , widely regarded as the most influential newspaper in china , published an article in english announcing changes to that country 's domain name system .
the domain name system , comprising generic top-level domains such as .com and country-code top-level domains such as .uk , ensures that e-mail arrives at the intended address and that websites are accessible worldwide .
administered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , a us non-profit organisation , the system depends upon the existence of a single root , an authoritative database that provides certainty by limiting each domain name to a single registrant .
the people 's daily article suggested that china was implementing several new chinese character domains , including .china , .com , and .net.
while that alone would attract attention , the article went on to state that as a consequence of the changes , " internet users do n't have to surf the web via the servers under the management of icann of the united states . "
those comments left many net watchers anxious to determine whether china had taken a significant step toward establishing a chinese internet that could function independently from the global internet maintained by icann and ultimately controlled by the us government .

the number of people online in china is growing fast there was a buzz in the internet community last week after the people 's daily , widely regarded as the most influential newspaper in china , published an article in english announcing changes to that country 's domain name system .
the domain name system , comprising generic top-level domains such as .com and country-code top-level domains such as .uk , ensures that e-mail arrives at the intended address and that websites are accessible worldwide .
administered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , a us non-profit organisation , the system depends upon the existence of a single root , an authoritative database that provides certainty by limiting each domain name to a single registrant .
the people 's daily article suggested that china was implementing several new chinese character domains , including .china , .com , and .net.
while that alone would attract attention , the article went on to state that as a consequence of the changes , " internet users do n't have to surf the web via the servers under the management of icann of the united states . "

the number of people online in china is growing fast there was a buzz in the internet community last week after the people 's daily , widely regarded as the most influential newspaper in china , published an article in english announcing changes to that country 's domain name system .
the domain name system , comprising generic top-level domains such as .com and country-code top-level domains such as .uk , ensures that e-mail arrives at the intended address and that websites are accessible worldwide .
administered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , a us non-profit organisation , the system depends upon the existence of a single root , an authoritative database that provides certainty by limiting each domain name to a single registrant .
the people 's daily article suggested that china was implementing several new chinese character domains , including .china , .com , and .net.
while that alone would attract attention , the article went on to state that as a consequence of the changes , " internet users do n't have to surf the web via the servers under the management of icann of the united states . "
those comments left many net watchers anxious to determine whether china had taken a significant step toward establishing a chinese internet that could function independently from the global internet maintained by icann and ultimately controlled by the us government .
in fact , given the existence of a chinese .com , the announcement raised the spectre of a competing system with the prospect of multiple roots .
slow progress while there still remains some uncertainty about the full implications of the chinese domain name changes , late last week officials sought to assure the world that it had no intention of creating a separate chinese internet .
the new chinese domains were in fact not so new as china had been experimenting with them for several years .
icann supporters breathed a sigh of relief .
with preparations under way for another international icann meeting later this month in wellington , new zealand , the threat of a potentially competing internet was no longer viewed as an immediate concern .
despite some modest successes , no one has ever come close to creating a national alternative that is functional for 110 million internet users the relief may be short-lived , since a closer examination of this past week 's events suggests that , bolstered by the chinese action , other countries may place increasing pressure for change to the current structure and administration of the internet .

the number of people online in china is growing fast there was a buzz in the internet community last week after the people 's daily , widely regarded as the most influential newspaper in china , published an article in english announcing changes to that country 's domain name system .
the domain name system , comprising generic top-level domains such as .com and country-code top-level domains such as .uk , ensures that e-mail arrives at the intended address and that websites are accessible worldwide .
administered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , a us non-profit organisation , the system depends upon the existence of a single root , an authoritative database that provides certainty by limiting each domain name to a single registrant .
the people 's daily article suggested that china was implementing several new chinese character domains , including .china , .com , and .net.
while that alone would attract attention , the article went on to state that as a consequence of the changes , " internet users do n't have to surf the web via the servers under the management of icann of the united states . "
those comments left many net watchers anxious to determine whether china had taken a significant step toward establishing a chinese internet that could function independently from the global internet maintained by icann and ultimately controlled by the us government .
in fact , given the existence of a chinese .com , the announcement raised the spectre of a competing system with the prospect of multiple roots .
slow progress while there still remains some uncertainty about the full implications of the chinese domain name changes , late last week officials sought to assure the world that it had no intention of creating a separate chinese internet .
the new chinese domains were in fact not so new as china had been experimenting with them for several years .
icann supporters breathed a sigh of relief .
with preparations under way for another international icann meeting later this month in wellington , new zealand , the threat of a potentially competing internet was no longer viewed as an immediate concern .
despite some modest successes , no one has ever come close to creating a national alternative that is functional for 110 million internet users the relief may be short-lived , since a closer examination of this past week 's events suggests that , bolstered by the chinese action , other countries may place increasing pressure for change to the current structure and administration of the internet .
the chinese decision to fully implement chinese character domain names reinforces the mounting frustration of many non-english speaking countries with icann 's apparent inability to expand into multilingual domain names .
these are often referred to as internationalised domain names , idn .
while icann has conducted studies and consultations on idn implementation , progress has been painfully slow .
china 's ability to implement its own idn system without icann support is likely to serve as a model for many other countries around the world .
in the months ahead , look for countries in south america , the middle east , and other parts of asia to emulate the chinese lead by establishing their own national idns .

the money is in addition to £ 11m of stolen cash already seized by police officers in a series of raids .
the exact size of the new haul , found in the past 36 hours , is not yet known , but it is believed to be millions .
forensic searches have been taking place at a domestic garage in southborough , near tunbridge wells .
police activity began at the private lock-up on sunday evening .
forensic officers in white boiler suits were working at the scene , which was cordoned off on monday .
i 'd like to make clear our absolute determination to catch the people who committed this crime chief constable michael fuller five people have been charged after the depot raid in tonbridge on 22 february .
a total of 17 people have been arrested .
kent chief constable michael fuller said more than £ 9m was seized in a police raid on a vehicle repair yard in welling , south-east london , last week .
mr fuller said officers were doing " everything humanly possible " to ensure no-one profited from the raid .
in less than two weeks since the raid in tonbridge , police have followed up 1,200 pieces of information , seized more than 3,500 exhibits , and taken more than 300 witness statements .
chief constable michael fuller said police were following up every lead a number of vehicles believed to be used in the crime have also been recovered , and at least 20 premises searched .
mr fuller said the scale of the operation was massive , with more than 300 police officers and staff working on the hunt for those responsible .
" i 'd like to make clear our absolute determination to catch the people who committed this crime , " he said .
" we will do everything humanly possible to retrieve all the stolen money and track down the criminals involved .
' human experience ' " our aim is to ensure that no-one profits from this crime .
" we will do whatever it takes and go wherever we need to in the world to achieve this aim . "
mr fuller said the amount of money stolen should not overshadow the human experience of those involved in the ordeal .
he said depot manager colin dixon , his wife lynn and nine-year-old son , who were held at gunpoint in the hours leading up to the robbery , were recovering well .
mr fuller said the investigation was likely to continue for many months and involve " meticulous attention to detail " .

anytime something that is purely a business deal gets stopped - whether for security reasons or any reason - it will raise a flag and make some people think twice .
lou scotto , american business council of dubai the gulf states are riding the crest of the oil boom , and have been looking to invest some of their new-found wealth outside the region .
the aim : to reduce their dependence on oil .
in the past 18 months alone , uae based companies have bought a $ 2bn stake in time warner , a $ 1bn stake in daimlerchrysler , a $ 700m hotel in new york , the port assets of america 's csx corporation and a 25 % stake in a canadian aluminium smelter .
suddenly , with dp world , the shopping spree has hit a roadblock .
america seems to have decided there are limits after all .
environment is the uae government worried ?
" the only thing that i personally think might be a concern is about the foreign investment going into the us , " says the uae 's economy minister , lubna bint khalid al qasimi .
" the question is whether these kind of processes will take longer because of politics and things like that .
that would raise a concern not only to investors here , but probably in other countries - because that 's a sign of whether it 's a pro-investment environment or not . "
this fear is echoed around the gulf .
the head of the american business council in dubai has written an open letter to congress supporting dp world .
if the deal goes through , dp world will operate six us ports if necessary , he says , he 'll send a delegation over to persuade us lawmakers in person - because the row will inevitably affect how keen gulf investors are to do business with america .
" it would have to , would n't it ? " says council head lou scotto .
" anytime something that is purely a business deal gets stopped - whether for security reasons or any reason - it will raise a flag and make some people think twice .
" or at least have an alternative plan of action : ' well , if not the us , then where else can we go ? " '
to complicate matters , the two countries are in the middle of negotiations to sign a free trade deal .
those talks are carrying on as usual , but negotiations may now be slowed while certain points are clarified .
" this incident with p & o may just bring certain questions on our side about the process of investment - because a major chunk of the fta is related to investment and investment in the us , " says sheikha lubna .
" so this will maybe require some clarification of questions on our side .
but i am 100 % confident that it will go through . "
richer pickings with oil prices expected to remain high , gulf governments are keen to carry on with their acquisition spree .
they understand the us context , they appreciate president bush 's support , and are happy to wait a little longer - as long as the dp world deal does eventually go through .
private investors , however , may be more easily put off .
" organisations such as the kuwait investment agency and the abu dhabi investment authority are , i think , are looking at the situation and saying ' it does n't change our modus operandi ' , " says steve brice at standard chartered bank .
" private individuals i think are probably the people who will change their minds . "
for many of these investors , the us offers relatively few good deals anyway - particularly in comparison to the property and stock market booms in the middle east , or the potential returns from asia .
political problems will just persuade them to carry on looking elsewhere .
the row over dp world will not stop those who spot an opportunity in america from pursuing it .
but it may give many investors pause for thought - the more so if the row drags on without a solution .
and particularly if they find there are simply easier and more profitable places to do business elsewhere .
