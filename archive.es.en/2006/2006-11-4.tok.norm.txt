" the role of germany will be pivotal as berlin takes over both the 12-month presidency of the g8 group of leading industrialized nations and the six-month european union -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and blair agreed all nations need to " wake up " to climate change persuading washington that " this is a very important issue for all of us " is a critical task , she told reporters . for his part , blair said it was important to create the right framework for international agreement and there was a " real opportunity " to make progress in the coming year when germany takes over the european union presidency . he also said there was a " sense of hope " that the united states could be part of any new agreement , particularly with a growing , cross-party consensus in many us states about the need for clean energy . the prime minister is keen to push the issues further up the agenda after his government published a major report monday , which said global warming could cost the world 's economies up to 20 percent of their gross domestic product . fighting global warming cheaper than doing nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aircraft are a large contributor to carbon emissions former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern 's climate change report said combating global warming would cost about 1 percent of gdp , 20 times less than the potential cost of doing nothing . the report recommended a huge expansion of carbon-emissions trading networks such as that set up by the 25-nation eu bloc , which aim to limit pollution by allowing industries to buy and sell their emission rights . britain , which under blair has become one of europe 's most deregulated economies , is keen to see the eu 's carbon-trading market expanded to tie in with others around the world . merkel said germany was interested in the contents of the stern report but highlighted that there was " no real compatibility " with german efforts to tackle climate change and some existing eu rules . instead , " europe-wide instruments " are needed , she added . foreign policy also discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days of unrest in the gaza strip has claimed over 20 lives blair and merkel 's talks also touched on the middle east , afghanistan - where both countries have troops - and nato talks later this month in riga . on the middle east , where german troops are part of the united nations force policing the lebanese ceasefire , merkel said it was important to revive the peace process amid a bloody new wave of violence in the gaza strip . after it emerged that blair changed his policy toward damascus and sent a senior adviser to meet syrian president bashar al-assad this week , merkel also agreed with her british counterpart that it was vital to involve damascus in efforts to bring peace to the troubled region . " we 've got to give the syrians a chance to show that they are ready to play a constructive role if they want to , " she added . a number of european countries , including britain , scaled back relations with syria after the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri last year . on afghanistan , she agreed with blair that the military option to bring stability there was only one part of the solution . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and blair faced with ample ground to cover while british prime minister blair presses the conversation towards climate change and energy security , german chancellor merkel will want to focus on the eu 's foreign policy during a short meeting in london .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?

" europe needs a strategy for the time once the kyoto protocol has elapsed in 2012 , " she said .
" we have to do everything in order to issue a wake-up call to all nations .
climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st century . " the role of germany will be pivotal as berlin takes over both the 12-month presidency of the g8 group of leading industrialized nations and the six-month european union -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and blair agreed all nations need to " wake up " to climate change persuading washington that " this is a very important issue for all of us " is a critical task , she told reporters . for his part , blair said it was important to create the right framework for international agreement and there was a " real opportunity " to make progress in the coming year when germany takes over the european union presidency . he also said there was a " sense of hope " that the united states could be part of any new agreement , particularly with a growing , cross-party consensus in many us states about the need for clean energy . the prime minister is keen to push the issues further up the agenda after his government published a major report monday , which said global warming could cost the world 's economies up to 20 percent of their gross domestic product . fighting global warming cheaper than doing nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aircraft are a large contributor to carbon emissions former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern 's climate change report said combating global warming would cost about 1 percent of gdp , 20 times less than the potential cost of doing nothing . the report recommended a huge expansion of carbon-emissions trading networks such as that set up by the 25-nation eu bloc , which aim to limit pollution by allowing industries to buy and sell their emission rights . britain , which under blair has become one of europe 's most deregulated economies , is keen to see the eu 's carbon-trading market expanded to tie in with others around the world . merkel said germany was interested in the contents of the stern report but highlighted that there was " no real compatibility " with german efforts to tackle climate change and some existing eu rules . instead , " europe-wide instruments " are needed , she added . foreign policy also discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days of unrest in the gaza strip has claimed over 20 lives blair and merkel 's talks also touched on the middle east , afghanistan - where both countries have troops - and nato talks later this month in riga . on the middle east , where german troops are part of the united nations force policing the lebanese ceasefire , merkel said it was important to revive the peace process amid a bloody new wave of violence in the gaza strip . after it emerged that blair changed his policy toward damascus and sent a senior adviser to meet syrian president bashar al-assad this week , merkel also agreed with her british counterpart that it was vital to involve damascus in efforts to bring peace to the troubled region . " we 've got to give the syrians a chance to show that they are ready to play a constructive role if they want to , " she added . a number of european countries , including britain , scaled back relations with syria after the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri last year . on afghanistan , she agreed with blair that the military option to bring stability there was only one part of the solution . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and blair faced with ample ground to cover while british prime minister blair presses the conversation towards climate change and energy security , german chancellor merkel will want to focus on the eu 's foreign policy during a short meeting in london .

" the luxury hotel market in berlin is fiercely competitive , " says natascha kompatzki , spokeswoman for berlin 's tourism marketing department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritz-carlton hotel on potsdamer platz according to her , the average cost of a night 's stay in berlin five-star hotel is 127 euros -lrb- $ 162 -rrb- , while in london a night will set you back 277 euros -lrb- $ 352 -rrb- .
in paris the average is 282 euros while one will generally pay 294 euros for five-star service in milan . a prestige issue another characteristic of berlin is that many of the capital 's four-star hotels are of the same standard as their five-star cousins in terms of service and furnishings . but operators are reluctant to apply for the higher classification for fear of scaring off business travelers who feel such luxury would look bad on their expense accounts . one hotel which has adopted this strategy is the hotel melia , which opened without fanfare earlier this month in the heart of the capital , a short walk from the historic brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel adlon is world famous the oval-shaped superior standard hotel has 355 rooms , a tapas bar , steam room and fitness center among its facilities .
it is located just 200 meters from other four-star accommodation like the jolly hotel and maritim . it has also become something of a prestige issue for major chains to operate a top-class hotel in berlin . " investors are always on the lookout for suitable locations for a hotel , " says kompatzki . while the central mitte district is the preferred choice , they are also looking a bit further a field in the west of the capital .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team .

" europe needs a strategy for the time once the kyoto protocol has elapsed in 2012 , " she said .
" we have to do everything in order to issue a wake-up call to all nations .
climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st century .

" we 've got to give the syrians a chance to show that they are ready to play a constructive role if they want to , " she added . a number of european countries , including britain , scaled back relations with syria after the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri last year . on afghanistan , she agreed with blair that the military option to bring stability there was only one part of the solution . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and blair faced with ample ground to cover while british prime minister blair presses the conversation towards climate change and energy security , german chancellor merkel will want to focus on the eu 's foreign policy during a short meeting in london .

" when i tell others that we home school our children , it 's like saying , ' well , i 'll just enter the cellar with my whisky bottle and carpet knife , and take out my own appendix . '
in england , it 's equivalent to saying , ' we 're vegetarians or i 'm left-handed , " ' skeed said . german law requires all children between six and 18 years of age to attend a school or take part in a training program . battle with authorities over home schooling the skeed family , who live in sparsely populated märkisch region of the sauerland mountains , has battled with school authorities in the state of north rhine westphalia for years over the decision to educate their brood at home .
in germany , the individual states preside over educational matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few school choices for people in sauerland and other rural areas " we need to act in the interests of the children , " said brigitte bunselmeister-lohr , a stae school official , adding that authorities have done their best to convince the skeeds to send their kids to school without adversely affecting the children .
" there are very young children , who have never been to school , and they have not made their own choice to be educated at home . " reasons to home school there are various reasons why parents choose to home school their children , among them dissatisfaction with standards in their regional school system , overcrowded classrooms or a school philosophy that counteracts their own beliefs .
parents , such as natasha steed argue that home schooling is a more effective way of learning for her own children . " i have adhered very closely to the german school curriculum , and have found that children learn much more quickly in an intensive environment .
in one year , i have taught my eldest child , my daughter , material that is covered in two years in the schools , " she said .
" it was no problem . " children need to interact socially with others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do home schooled children miss out on interaction with other kids ?
however , educational authorities in germany say that school is not just about learning math or language skills , but how to socially interact with other children and adults from diverse backgrounds . " at home , children only experience one segment of society , where they live , learn and grow up .
they do n't get to see the broad spectrum , which our young citizens need to be exposed to , " said bunselmeister-lohr . jonathan skeed begs to differ .
" this has nothing to do with being socially isolated .
we regard home schooling as very positive , family-friendly alternative , " he said .
" children do learn well in a flexible , relaxed environment . " more rural area families choose to home school bunselmeister-lohr , however , did acknowledge that more families in north rhine westphalia are reluctant to send their children to the state 's school . " families which home school , are still very much the exception in märkisch county , although in the past several years , the number of such cases has climbed , " she said . after paying over 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,632 -rrb- in penalties for illegally home schooling their children , the skeed family has decided to throw in the towel .
they are trading the sauerland mountains for the english seaside in the isle of wight , where their children will not be required to learn inside an official school . heiko dolle -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parents wanting to homeschool turn to eu court a hamburg family wanting to homeschool their children have been forced to flee the country in what lawyers say is not a unique case in germany .

" " the need for an initiative for central asia by the european union has never been clearer to me than after this trip , " he told reporters in the kyrgyz capital bishkek , the final stop on his five-nation tour . after noting that conflicts in afghanistan and iran , two of the region 's neighboring countries , were central concerns in germany and the rest of europe , steinmeier said it is crucial for the eu to pay attention to an area of the world already closely watched by russia , china , japan and the united states . " the region is too important for us to push out to the edge of our consciousness , " he said .
" it is absolutely justified that we -lrb- the eu -rrb- be present here with our strengths . " eu to devise developmental plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said europe should make its interests in central asia clear while praising the progress made in the five former soviet republics since they achieved their independence in 1991 , steinmeier promised them european additional support in developing fair judicial systems and democratic governments . " we are not only going to support this bilaterally , but also with an initiative from the eu that will take a new look at central asia , " he said . though steinmeier did not provide a timetable , the foreign minister added developing a european policy for the region to the list of tasks germany would like to accomplish during its six months at the head of the eu 's rotating presidency in the first half of 2007 . the bloc currently has a delegation in kazakhstan 's biggest city , almaty , which is responsible for eu relations with that country as well as tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .
while the eu has no representation in uzbekistan or turkmenistan and the bloc 's member states currently have differing views on diplomatic relations with the " stan " nations . a european example of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the opium and heroin in europe comes through central asia from afghanistan kazakhstan is rapidly increasing its crude oil output , while uzbekistan and turkmenistan have large natural gas reserves that steinmeier said could play a role in diversifying europe 's energy supply . the region 's proximity to iran and afghanistan , however , is seen by the west as a potentially destabilizing influence , and much of the opium produced in afghanistan travels through tajikistan before finding its way to europe . the european union itself , however , could be a solid example for central asia , steinmeier said , adding that the countries would benefit from increasing economic cooperation in a manner similar how the european economic community expanded to the now 25-member bloc . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier criticizes central asia 's forgotten dictatorship frank walter steinmeier 's five-day central asian tour took the german foreign minister to turkmenistan on thursday where he issued a critical statement of the repressive state 's human rights record .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests .

" europe needs a strategy for the time once the kyoto protocol has elapsed in 2012 , " she said .
" we have to do everything in order to issue a wake-up call to all nations .
climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st century . " the role of germany will be pivotal as berlin takes over both the 12-month presidency of the g8 group of leading industrialized nations and the six-month european union -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and blair agreed all nations need to " wake up " to climate change persuading washington that " this is a very important issue for all of us " is a critical task , she told reporters . for his part , blair said it was important to create the right framework for international agreement and there was a " real opportunity " to make progress in the coming year when germany takes over the european union presidency . he also said there was a " sense of hope " that the united states could be part of any new agreement , particularly with a growing , cross-party consensus in many us states about the need for clean energy . the prime minister is keen to push the issues further up the agenda after his government published a major report monday , which said global warming could cost the world 's economies up to 20 percent of their gross domestic product . fighting global warming cheaper than doing nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aircraft are a large contributor to carbon emissions former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern 's climate change report said combating global warming would cost about 1 percent of gdp , 20 times less than the potential cost of doing nothing . the report recommended a huge expansion of carbon-emissions trading networks such as that set up by the 25-nation eu bloc , which aim to limit pollution by allowing industries to buy and sell their emission rights . britain , which under blair has become one of europe 's most deregulated economies , is keen to see the eu 's carbon-trading market expanded to tie in with others around the world . merkel said germany was interested in the contents of the stern report but highlighted that there was " no real compatibility " with german efforts to tackle climate change and some existing eu rules . instead , " europe-wide instruments " are needed , she added . foreign policy also discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days of unrest in the gaza strip has claimed over 20 lives blair and merkel 's talks also touched on the middle east , afghanistan - where both countries have troops - and nato talks later this month in riga . on the middle east , where german troops are part of the united nations force policing the lebanese ceasefire , merkel said it was important to revive the peace process amid a bloody new wave of violence in the gaza strip . after it emerged that blair changed his policy toward damascus and sent a senior adviser to meet syrian president bashar al-assad this week , merkel also agreed with her british counterpart that it was vital to involve damascus in efforts to bring peace to the troubled region . " we 've got to give the syrians a chance to show that they are ready to play a constructive role if they want to , " she added . a number of european countries , including britain , scaled back relations with syria after the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri last year . on afghanistan , she agreed with blair that the military option to bring stability there was only one part of the solution . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and blair faced with ample ground to cover while british prime minister blair presses the conversation towards climate change and energy security , german chancellor merkel will want to focus on the eu 's foreign policy during a short meeting in london .

" when i tell others that we home school our children , it 's like saying , ' well , i 'll just enter the cellar with my whisky bottle and carpet knife , and take out my own appendix . '
in england , it 's equivalent to saying , ' we 're vegetarians or i 'm left-handed , " ' skeed said . german law requires all children between six and 18 years of age to attend a school or take part in a training program . battle with authorities over home schooling the skeed family , who live in sparsely populated märkisch region of the sauerland mountains , has battled with school authorities in the state of north rhine westphalia for years over the decision to educate their brood at home .
in germany , the individual states preside over educational matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few school choices for people in sauerland and other rural areas " we need to act in the interests of the children , " said brigitte bunselmeister-lohr , a stae school official , adding that authorities have done their best to convince the skeeds to send their kids to school without adversely affecting the children .
" there are very young children , who have never been to school , and they have not made their own choice to be educated at home . " reasons to home school there are various reasons why parents choose to home school their children , among them dissatisfaction with standards in their regional school system , overcrowded classrooms or a school philosophy that counteracts their own beliefs .
parents , such as natasha steed argue that home schooling is a more effective way of learning for her own children . " i have adhered very closely to the german school curriculum , and have found that children learn much more quickly in an intensive environment .
in one year , i have taught my eldest child , my daughter , material that is covered in two years in the schools , " she said .
" it was no problem . " children need to interact socially with others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do home schooled children miss out on interaction with other kids ?
however , educational authorities in germany say that school is not just about learning math or language skills , but how to socially interact with other children and adults from diverse backgrounds . " at home , children only experience one segment of society , where they live , learn and grow up .
they do n't get to see the broad spectrum , which our young citizens need to be exposed to , " said bunselmeister-lohr . jonathan skeed begs to differ .
" this has nothing to do with being socially isolated .
we regard home schooling as very positive , family-friendly alternative , " he said .
" children do learn well in a flexible , relaxed environment . " more rural area families choose to home school bunselmeister-lohr , however , did acknowledge that more families in north rhine westphalia are reluctant to send their children to the state 's school . " families which home school , are still very much the exception in märkisch county , although in the past several years , the number of such cases has climbed , " she said . after paying over 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,632 -rrb- in penalties for illegally home schooling their children , the skeed family has decided to throw in the towel .
they are trading the sauerland mountains for the english seaside in the isle of wight , where their children will not be required to learn inside an official school . heiko dolle -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parents wanting to homeschool turn to eu court a hamburg family wanting to homeschool their children have been forced to flee the country in what lawyers say is not a unique case in germany .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

" kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

" europe needs a strategy for the time once the kyoto protocol has elapsed in 2012 , " she said .
" we have to do everything in order to issue a wake-up call to all nations .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .

" " the need for an initiative for central asia by the european union has never been clearer to me than after this trip , " he told reporters in the kyrgyz capital bishkek , the final stop on his five-nation tour . after noting that conflicts in afghanistan and iran , two of the region 's neighboring countries , were central concerns in germany and the rest of europe , steinmeier said it is crucial for the eu to pay attention to an area of the world already closely watched by russia , china , japan and the united states . " the region is too important for us to push out to the edge of our consciousness , " he said .
" it is absolutely justified that we -lrb- the eu -rrb- be present here with our strengths . " eu to devise developmental plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said europe should make its interests in central asia clear while praising the progress made in the five former soviet republics since they achieved their independence in 1991 , steinmeier promised them european additional support in developing fair judicial systems and democratic governments . " we are not only going to support this bilaterally , but also with an initiative from the eu that will take a new look at central asia , " he said . though steinmeier did not provide a timetable , the foreign minister added developing a european policy for the region to the list of tasks germany would like to accomplish during its six months at the head of the eu 's rotating presidency in the first half of 2007 . the bloc currently has a delegation in kazakhstan 's biggest city , almaty , which is responsible for eu relations with that country as well as tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .
while the eu has no representation in uzbekistan or turkmenistan and the bloc 's member states currently have differing views on diplomatic relations with the " stan " nations . a european example of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the opium and heroin in europe comes through central asia from afghanistan kazakhstan is rapidly increasing its crude oil output , while uzbekistan and turkmenistan have large natural gas reserves that steinmeier said could play a role in diversifying europe 's energy supply . the region 's proximity to iran and afghanistan , however , is seen by the west as a potentially destabilizing influence , and much of the opium produced in afghanistan travels through tajikistan before finding its way to europe . the european union itself , however , could be a solid example for central asia , steinmeier said , adding that the countries would benefit from increasing economic cooperation in a manner similar how the european economic community expanded to the now 25-member bloc . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier criticizes central asia 's forgotten dictatorship frank walter steinmeier 's five-day central asian tour took the german foreign minister to turkmenistan on thursday where he issued a critical statement of the repressive state 's human rights record .

in germany , the individual states preside over educational matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few school choices for people in sauerland and other rural areas " we need to act in the interests of the children , " said brigitte bunselmeister-lohr , a stae school official , adding that authorities have done their best to convince the skeeds to send their kids to school without adversely affecting the children .
" there are very young children , who have never been to school , and they have not made their own choice to be educated at home . " reasons to home school there are various reasons why parents choose to home school their children , among them dissatisfaction with standards in their regional school system , overcrowded classrooms or a school philosophy that counteracts their own beliefs .
parents , such as natasha steed argue that home schooling is a more effective way of learning for her own children . " i have adhered very closely to the german school curriculum , and have found that children learn much more quickly in an intensive environment .
in one year , i have taught my eldest child , my daughter , material that is covered in two years in the schools , " she said .
" it was no problem . " children need to interact socially with others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do home schooled children miss out on interaction with other kids ?
however , educational authorities in germany say that school is not just about learning math or language skills , but how to socially interact with other children and adults from diverse backgrounds . " at home , children only experience one segment of society , where they live , learn and grow up .
they do n't get to see the broad spectrum , which our young citizens need to be exposed to , " said bunselmeister-lohr . jonathan skeed begs to differ .
" this has nothing to do with being socially isolated .
we regard home schooling as very positive , family-friendly alternative , " he said .
" children do learn well in a flexible , relaxed environment . " more rural area families choose to home school bunselmeister-lohr , however , did acknowledge that more families in north rhine westphalia are reluctant to send their children to the state 's school . " families which home school , are still very much the exception in märkisch county , although in the past several years , the number of such cases has climbed , " she said . after paying over 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,632 -rrb- in penalties for illegally home schooling their children , the skeed family has decided to throw in the towel .

" the luxury hotel market in berlin is fiercely competitive , " says natascha kompatzki , spokeswoman for berlin 's tourism marketing department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritz-carlton hotel on potsdamer platz according to her , the average cost of a night 's stay in berlin five-star hotel is 127 euros -lrb- $ 162 -rrb- , while in london a night will set you back 277 euros -lrb- $ 352 -rrb- .
in paris the average is 282 euros while one will generally pay 294 euros for five-star service in milan . a prestige issue another characteristic of berlin is that many of the capital 's four-star hotels are of the same standard as their five-star cousins in terms of service and furnishings . but operators are reluctant to apply for the higher classification for fear of scaring off business travelers who feel such luxury would look bad on their expense accounts . one hotel which has adopted this strategy is the hotel melia , which opened without fanfare earlier this month in the heart of the capital , a short walk from the historic brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel adlon is world famous the oval-shaped superior standard hotel has 355 rooms , a tapas bar , steam room and fitness center among its facilities .
it is located just 200 meters from other four-star accommodation like the jolly hotel and maritim . it has also become something of a prestige issue for major chains to operate a top-class hotel in berlin . " investors are always on the lookout for suitable locations for a hotel , " says kompatzki . while the central mitte district is the preferred choice , they are also looking a bit further a field in the west of the capital .

in paris the average is 282 euros while one will generally pay 294 euros for five-star service in milan . a prestige issue another characteristic of berlin is that many of the capital 's four-star hotels are of the same standard as their five-star cousins in terms of service and furnishings . but operators are reluctant to apply for the higher classification for fear of scaring off business travelers who feel such luxury would look bad on their expense accounts . one hotel which has adopted this strategy is the hotel melia , which opened without fanfare earlier this month in the heart of the capital , a short walk from the historic brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel adlon is world famous the oval-shaped superior standard hotel has 355 rooms , a tapas bar , steam room and fitness center among its facilities .
it is located just 200 meters from other four-star accommodation like the jolly hotel and maritim . it has also become something of a prestige issue for major chains to operate a top-class hotel in berlin . " investors are always on the lookout for suitable locations for a hotel , " says kompatzki . while the central mitte district is the preferred choice , they are also looking a bit further a field in the west of the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 04.11.2006 white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's hunting federation called deer like this mutations killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw . one minute you 're gamboling freely through the german undergrowth ; the next , your carcass is adorning a study wall or fireside hearth . life in the wilds around the erzgebirge mountains of eastern germany is a precarious balancing act .
just ask bruno the bear .
except you wo n't get an answer because he 's dead . the same fate could await the latest animal to rise to the top of a german state 's hit list .
a rare albino deer dubbed white bambi is currently living on borrowed time as hunters and local officials in the eastern german state of saxony argue about whether the buck should be killed . " the white deer is a mutation .
it does not belong in the wild ; it should be shot , " said günter giese , the president of the saxony hunting federation . what 's behind the bloodlust ?
giese was just echoing the thoughts of wildlife experts who have stated that the animal poses a danger to future generations of deer in the region and should be taken out of circulation .
they are concerned that bambi could contaminate the gene pool of the deer population when it mates . legend could save bambi 's hide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters are unwilling to kill the real-life white bambi however , bambi , blissfully unaware of the entire furor at the moment , has a group of unexpected supporters .
hunters in the erzgebirge mountain region are refusing to shoot him . " we who hunt in this area agree that the deer should stay alive because we enjoy seeing it and because it is pretty , " gottfried meier , a hunter who has regularly spotted white bambi since he first appeared in may , told reporters .
" a white deer is something different . " apart from looking pretty , the hunters have another more mysterious reason for not putting a bullet between bambi 's eyes .
many hunters believe that a curse falls on anyone who kills a white deer .
legend has it that the hunter or a member of his family will die within a year of the deer 's death . white stag 's death caused world war i ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand 's hunting hobby has a lot to answer for one famous hunter who is often quoted in the cautionary tale is one archduke franz ferdinand .
the austrian leader was a keen hunter and shot a white stag in the autumn of 1913 .
within a year , he was assassinated in sarajevo and the rest , as they say , is history . bambi , rare because only one in 10,000 deer has the genetic trait that makes it an albino , is gaining in fame in a country still mourning the killing of bruno the brown bear in july . bruno made the mistake of wandering down from the italian alps into bavaria in the spring where he went on a seven-week rampage .
after being declared a public danger after walking through villages , killing livestock and famously sitting on a guinea pig , the bavarian environment ministry sent a team of assassins after bruno . deceased problem bear casts long shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno crossed the bavarian alps with fatal consequences his reign of terror was brought to end by a single bullet in july sparking a national outcry and causing a pr disaster for the bavarian tourism industry . already associated with the painful case of bruno , bambi is making headlines : " new bruno case ?

killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw . one minute you 're gamboling freely through the german undergrowth ; the next , your carcass is adorning a study wall or fireside hearth . life in the wilds around the erzgebirge mountains of eastern germany is a precarious balancing act .
just ask bruno the bear .
except you wo n't get an answer because he 's dead . the same fate could await the latest animal to rise to the top of a german state 's hit list .
a rare albino deer dubbed white bambi is currently living on borrowed time as hunters and local officials in the eastern german state of saxony argue about whether the buck should be killed . " the white deer is a mutation .
it does not belong in the wild ; it should be shot , " said günter giese , the president of the saxony hunting federation . what 's behind the bloodlust ?
giese was just echoing the thoughts of wildlife experts who have stated that the animal poses a danger to future generations of deer in the region and should be taken out of circulation .
they are concerned that bambi could contaminate the gene pool of the deer population when it mates . legend could save bambi 's hide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters are unwilling to kill the real-life white bambi however , bambi , blissfully unaware of the entire furor at the moment , has a group of unexpected supporters .
hunters in the erzgebirge mountain region are refusing to shoot him . " we who hunt in this area agree that the deer should stay alive because we enjoy seeing it and because it is pretty , " gottfried meier , a hunter who has regularly spotted white bambi since he first appeared in may , told reporters .
" a white deer is something different . " apart from looking pretty , the hunters have another more mysterious reason for not putting a bullet between bambi 's eyes .
many hunters believe that a curse falls on anyone who kills a white deer .
legend has it that the hunter or a member of his family will die within a year of the deer 's death . white stag 's death caused world war i ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand 's hunting hobby has a lot to answer for one famous hunter who is often quoted in the cautionary tale is one archduke franz ferdinand .
the austrian leader was a keen hunter and shot a white stag in the autumn of 1913 .
within a year , he was assassinated in sarajevo and the rest , as they say , is history . bambi , rare because only one in 10,000 deer has the genetic trait that makes it an albino , is gaining in fame in a country still mourning the killing of bruno the brown bear in july . bruno made the mistake of wandering down from the italian alps into bavaria in the spring where he went on a seven-week rampage .
after being declared a public danger after walking through villages , killing livestock and famously sitting on a guinea pig , the bavarian environment ministry sent a team of assassins after bruno . deceased problem bear casts long shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno crossed the bavarian alps with fatal consequences his reign of terror was brought to end by a single bullet in july sparking a national outcry and causing a pr disaster for the bavarian tourism industry . already associated with the painful case of bruno , bambi is making headlines : " new bruno case ?
hunt for white bambi " screamed the mass-circulation bild tabloid this week . the saxony environment ministry , keen to avoid the same faux pas made by its bavarian counterpart , is publicly backing bambi . " as a rarity and natural phenomenon , it should be allowed to live , " a ministry spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " problem bear , " bruno , is dead " bruno " - the first wild brown bear to be sighted in germany in over 170 years - was shot dead in bavaria .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?

german star strikers missing the net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi practiced with the national team but did n't make the world cup roster supposed star german soccer players benjamin lauth and kevin kuranyi were predicted to be the next big thing for german soccer , but prospects have gone from bad to worse for these two players . when former coach jürgen klinsmann dumped kevin kuranyi from his germany squad ahead of the world cup it was regarded as a major surprise .
kuranyi had , after all , scored a creditable 14 goals in 35 appearances for the national side since his debut in march 2003 . a month earlier that year , benjamin lauth had run out for germany for the first time after impressively bursting onto the bundesliga scene for 1860 munich . both in their early 20s , lauth and kuranyi were seen as a great future offensive force for germany , almost certain to be contenders to lead the attack at the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not being a part of the world cup at home was a low point for both players sv hamburg moved to snap up lauth in 2004 when 1860 munich failed to escape relegation , while kuranyi switched from vfb stuttgart to big-spending schalke 04 for 7 million euros -lrb- $ 8.93 million -rrb- - a record transfer sum for stuttgart - in the summer of 2005 .
both hamburg and schalke , major clubs trying to recapture their glory years , expected big things from their new star strikers , but neither has booked the success they were hoping to buy . lauth is now nearly a forgotten figure who is n't even making appearances on the substitutes ' bench in hamburg , while kuranyi 's career has nosedived this year following the shock of having to watch the 2006 world cup from the stands . lauth 's fall from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth in happier days , scoring while playing for munich injuries have plagues lauth from making progress in hamburg .
the 25-year-old made only 10 appearances for the northerners in the 2004/05 season but seemed to be on the way back last season , and was even seen as having an outside chance of making klinsmann 's world cup squad . this season , however , hamburg coach thomas doll seems to be questioning whether lauth has the physical presence to lead the nearly non-existent hamburg attack . his appearances in the struggling team have been sporadic , and after an unlucky red card in a champions league game at cska moscow on sept .
26 he was been little more than a spectator . now lauth is wondering whether he has any future at all at the club after dropping down the pecking order , behind new signings boubacar sanogo , danijel ljuboja and paulo guerrero . " of course , i am disappointed not to have got the chance over a long period to play for half a game or longer , " he told kicker sports magazine .
" it is something i can not understand . " lauth rejected accusations he has not worked hard enough to fulfill his early promise . " last season we were third and i played 31 games .
now we are 15th and i am not good enough ?
that is something that is difficult for me to understand , " lauth said " physically i am in as good a shape as ever before , that 's been shown in all the fitness tests . " kuranyi 's heated reception has him warming benches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi attitude has been criticized by klinsmann kuranyi , meanwhile , is just as frustrated in gelsenkirchen , where the 24-year-old striker has been spending time warming the bench . the scorer of 40 goals in 99 games for stuttgart , he has netted just twice in nine matches this season and has still not been accepted by schalke fans , some of whom have cruelly jeered him . the situation went from bad to worse for kuranyi last week when the club fined him for failing to join the subs ' bench after being taken off by coach mirko slomka in a cup match . kuranyi 's strength in the air , pace and good technique had made him the german national team 's best striker during the 2004 european championships , but he was n't given a chance to improve his marks when germany hosted the world cup last summer . klinsmann was reportedly unhappy with kuranyi 's general attitude and took exception to kuranyi 's disco visits , lateness and the fact that he was lax in responding to emails , a crucial element of klinsmann 's training program as he was often managing the team of his home in california . when the world cup squad was announced there was no place for the striker , who has now not played for germany since last november and appears to be still suffering from his world cup omission . " it was a brutal shock for me , " he admitted in a recent interview with die welt newspaper .
" it was a big dream for me to play at the world cup in our own country .
i am trying not to think about it any more . " but kuranyi can not forget .
asked whether the present crisis was the lowest point in his career , he told kicker this week , " no , my low point was not being allowed to go to the world cup . " hard times call for hard work - or new teams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi and lauth have been spending their time on the bench despite their troubles , both kuranyi and lauth say they are prepared to fight for better times . " what 's happening is a catastrophe , " admitted kuranyi on his poor image with some schalke fans .
" it 's as if i have never kicked a ball before .
my 14 goals in 35 internationals , my goals in stuttgart - all forgotten .
that 's something you have to get over . " but he added : " i am not giving up .
i am not letting myself be broken ... when this time is over i will have learned a lot . " lauth , despite his present poor prospects in hamburg , is still aiming to add to his five international caps , though he is not ruling out a move to another team . " i am doing everything i can to make it here but if things carry on like this for months than i have to ask myself whether it still makes any sense , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw . one minute you 're gamboling freely through the german undergrowth ; the next , your carcass is adorning a study wall or fireside hearth . life in the wilds around the erzgebirge mountains of eastern germany is a precarious balancing act .

it does not belong in the wild ; it should be shot , " said günter giese , the president of the saxony hunting federation . what 's behind the bloodlust ?
giese was just echoing the thoughts of wildlife experts who have stated that the animal poses a danger to future generations of deer in the region and should be taken out of circulation .

" when i tell others that we home school our children , it 's like saying , ' well , i 'll just enter the cellar with my whisky bottle and carpet knife , and take out my own appendix . '
in england , it 's equivalent to saying , ' we 're vegetarians or i 'm left-handed , " ' skeed said . german law requires all children between six and 18 years of age to attend a school or take part in a training program . battle with authorities over home schooling the skeed family , who live in sparsely populated märkisch region of the sauerland mountains , has battled with school authorities in the state of north rhine westphalia for years over the decision to educate their brood at home .
in germany , the individual states preside over educational matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few school choices for people in sauerland and other rural areas " we need to act in the interests of the children , " said brigitte bunselmeister-lohr , a stae school official , adding that authorities have done their best to convince the skeeds to send their kids to school without adversely affecting the children .
" there are very young children , who have never been to school , and they have not made their own choice to be educated at home . " reasons to home school there are various reasons why parents choose to home school their children , among them dissatisfaction with standards in their regional school system , overcrowded classrooms or a school philosophy that counteracts their own beliefs .
parents , such as natasha steed argue that home schooling is a more effective way of learning for her own children . " i have adhered very closely to the german school curriculum , and have found that children learn much more quickly in an intensive environment .
in one year , i have taught my eldest child , my daughter , material that is covered in two years in the schools , " she said .
" it was no problem . " children need to interact socially with others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do home schooled children miss out on interaction with other kids ?
however , educational authorities in germany say that school is not just about learning math or language skills , but how to socially interact with other children and adults from diverse backgrounds . " at home , children only experience one segment of society , where they live , learn and grow up .
they do n't get to see the broad spectrum , which our young citizens need to be exposed to , " said bunselmeister-lohr . jonathan skeed begs to differ .
" this has nothing to do with being socially isolated .
we regard home schooling as very positive , family-friendly alternative , " he said .
" children do learn well in a flexible , relaxed environment . " more rural area families choose to home school bunselmeister-lohr , however , did acknowledge that more families in north rhine westphalia are reluctant to send their children to the state 's school . " families which home school , are still very much the exception in märkisch county , although in the past several years , the number of such cases has climbed , " she said . after paying over 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,632 -rrb- in penalties for illegally home schooling their children , the skeed family has decided to throw in the towel .

" the luxury hotel market in berlin is fiercely competitive , " says natascha kompatzki , spokeswoman for berlin 's tourism marketing department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ritz-carlton hotel on potsdamer platz according to her , the average cost of a night 's stay in berlin five-star hotel is 127 euros -lrb- $ 162 -rrb- , while in london a night will set you back 277 euros -lrb- $ 352 -rrb- .
in paris the average is 282 euros while one will generally pay 294 euros for five-star service in milan . a prestige issue another characteristic of berlin is that many of the capital 's four-star hotels are of the same standard as their five-star cousins in terms of service and furnishings . but operators are reluctant to apply for the higher classification for fear of scaring off business travelers who feel such luxury would look bad on their expense accounts . one hotel which has adopted this strategy is the hotel melia , which opened without fanfare earlier this month in the heart of the capital , a short walk from the historic brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel adlon is world famous the oval-shaped superior standard hotel has 355 rooms , a tapas bar , steam room and fitness center among its facilities .
it is located just 200 meters from other four-star accommodation like the jolly hotel and maritim . it has also become something of a prestige issue for major chains to operate a top-class hotel in berlin . " investors are always on the lookout for suitable locations for a hotel , " says kompatzki . while the central mitte district is the preferred choice , they are also looking a bit further a field in the west of the capital .

" when i tell others that we home school our children , it 's like saying , ' well , i 'll just enter the cellar with my whisky bottle and carpet knife , and take out my own appendix . '
in england , it 's equivalent to saying , ' we 're vegetarians or i 'm left-handed , " ' skeed said . german law requires all children between six and 18 years of age to attend a school or take part in a training program . battle with authorities over home schooling the skeed family , who live in sparsely populated märkisch region of the sauerland mountains , has battled with school authorities in the state of north rhine westphalia for years over the decision to educate their brood at home .
in germany , the individual states preside over educational matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few school choices for people in sauerland and other rural areas " we need to act in the interests of the children , " said brigitte bunselmeister-lohr , a stae school official , adding that authorities have done their best to convince the skeeds to send their kids to school without adversely affecting the children .
" there are very young children , who have never been to school , and they have not made their own choice to be educated at home . " reasons to home school there are various reasons why parents choose to home school their children , among them dissatisfaction with standards in their regional school system , overcrowded classrooms or a school philosophy that counteracts their own beliefs .
parents , such as natasha steed argue that home schooling is a more effective way of learning for her own children . " i have adhered very closely to the german school curriculum , and have found that children learn much more quickly in an intensive environment .
in one year , i have taught my eldest child , my daughter , material that is covered in two years in the schools , " she said .
" it was no problem . " children need to interact socially with others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do home schooled children miss out on interaction with other kids ?
however , educational authorities in germany say that school is not just about learning math or language skills , but how to socially interact with other children and adults from diverse backgrounds . " at home , children only experience one segment of society , where they live , learn and grow up .
they do n't get to see the broad spectrum , which our young citizens need to be exposed to , " said bunselmeister-lohr . jonathan skeed begs to differ .
" this has nothing to do with being socially isolated .
we regard home schooling as very positive , family-friendly alternative , " he said .
" children do learn well in a flexible , relaxed environment . " more rural area families choose to home school bunselmeister-lohr , however , did acknowledge that more families in north rhine westphalia are reluctant to send their children to the state 's school . " families which home school , are still very much the exception in märkisch county , although in the past several years , the number of such cases has climbed , " she said . after paying over 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,632 -rrb- in penalties for illegally home schooling their children , the skeed family has decided to throw in the towel .
they are trading the sauerland mountains for the english seaside in the isle of wight , where their children will not be required to learn inside an official school . heiko dolle -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parents wanting to homeschool turn to eu court a hamburg family wanting to homeschool their children have been forced to flee the country in what lawyers say is not a unique case in germany .

chinese president hu jintao made the announcement as he opened a summit in beijing attended by nearly 50 african heads of state and ministers .
the summit is focusing on business with more than 2,000 deals under discussion .
african leaders welcome their booming trade links with china , but critics accuse beijing of dealing with repressive regimes .
beijing says it is just doing business and has no political agenda .
' historic ' " our meeting today will go down in history , " mr hu told the china-africa summit .
" china will forever be a good friend , good partner , good brother of africa , " he said .
beijing means business ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi remembered china 's support during many african countries ' fight for independence .
" our main challenge now is not to fight colonialism , but fighting poverty and backwardness and achieving economic independence , " mr zenawi said .
" africa needs the support of its friends to overcome this challenge . "

africa is also a growing market for chinese goods , but critics say beijing is stifling african manufacturing .
some analysts have said africa is the only place left to go , as most of the world 's other big oil reserves are already being developed by major western energy companies .
the three-day summit is concentrating on the rapidly expanding economic ties between the two sides , and many new business deals are likely to be announced over the weekend .
many of them are expected to revolve around china 's hunger for african mineral resources , particularly oil .

thousands of people had gathered outside the famous jagannath temple in puri at the climax of a major festival which ends on monday .
according to the administrator of the jagannath temple , suresh mahapatra , the stampede happened at about 0600 -lrb- 0130 gmt -rrb- as the gates opened and some 4,000 people rushed to get in .

"
climate change is a reality , and science confirms that human activities are heavily implicated in this change .
but over the last few years a new environmental phenomenon has been constructed in this country - the phenomenon of " catastrophic " climate change .
it seems that mere " climate change " was not going to be bad enough , and so now it must be " catastrophic " to be worthy of attention .
the increasing use of this pejorative term - and its bedfellow qualifiers " chaotic " , " irreversible " , " rapid " - has altered the public discourse around climate change .
this discourse is now characterised by phrases such as " climate change is worse than we thought " , that we are approaching " irreversible tipping in the earth 's climate " , and that we are " at the point of no return " . "
it seems that we , the professional climate scientists , who are now the -lrb- catastrophe -rrb- sceptics " i have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric .
it seems that it is we , the professional climate scientists , who are now the -lrb- catastrophe -rrb- sceptics .
how the wheel turns .
boarding the bandwagon some recent examples of the catastrophists include tony blair , who a few weeks back warned in an open letter to eu head of states : " we have a window of only 10-15 years to take the steps we need to avoid crossing a catastrophic tipping point . "
today , a mass demonstration in trafalgar square will protest , aiming to " stop climate chaos " - the name for a coalition of environmental activists and faith-based organisations .
the bbc broadcast in may its climate chaos season of programmes .
there is even a publicly-funded science research project called rapid . "
scenarios of climate change are significant enough without invoking catastrophe and chaos as unguided weapons " why is it not just campaigners , but politicians and scientists too , who are openly confusing the language of fear , terror and disaster with the observable physical reality of climate change , actively ignoring the careful hedging which surrounds science 's predictions ?
james lovelock 's book the revenge of gaia takes this discourse to its logical endpoint - the end of human civilisation itself .
what has pushed the debate between climate change scientists and climate sceptics to now being between climate change scientists and climate alarmists ?
i believe there are three factors now at work .
first , the discourse of catastrophe is a campaigning device being mobilised in the context of failing uk and kyoto protocol targets to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide .
the signatories to this un protocol will not deliver on their obligations .
this bursting of the campaigning bubble requires a determined reaction to raise the stakes - the language of climate catastrophe nicely fits the bill .
hence we now have the militancy of the stop climate chaos activists and the megaphone journalism of the independent newspaper , with supporting rhetoric from the prime minister and senior government scientists .
others suggest that the sleeping giants of the gaian earth system are being roused from their millennia of slumber to wreck havoc on humanity .
media ' peddles climate porn ' second , the discourse of catastrophe is a political and rhetorical device to change the frame of reference for the emerging negotiations around what happens when the kyoto protocol runs out after 2012 .
the exeter conference of february 2005 on " avoiding dangerous climate change " served the government 's purposes of softening-up the g8 gleneagles summit through a frenzied week of " climate change is worse than we thought " news reporting and group-think .
by stage-managing the new language of catastrophe , the conference itself became a tipping point in the way that climate change is discussed in public .
third , the discourse of catastrophe allows some space for the retrenchment of science budgets .
it is a short step from claiming these catastrophic risks have physical reality , saliency and are imminent , to implying that one more " big push " of funding will allow science to quantify them objectively .
we need to take a deep breath and pause .
fear and terror the language of catastrophe is not the language of science .
it will not be visible in next year 's global assessment from the world authority of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
to state that climate change will be " catastrophic " hides a cascade of value-laden assumptions which do not emerge from empirical or theoretical science .
is any amount of climate change catastrophic ?
catastrophic for whom , for where , and by when ?
what index is being used to measure the catastrophe ?
the language of fear and terror operates as an ever-weakening vehicle for effective communication or inducement for behavioural change .
this has been seen in other areas of public health risk .
empirical work in relation to climate change communication and public perception shows that it operates here too .
framing climate change as an issue which evokes fear and personal stress becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy .
by " sexing it up " we exacerbate , through psychological amplifiers , the very risks we are trying to ward off .
the careless -lrb- or conspiratorial ? -rrb- translation of concern about saddam hussein 's putative military threat into the case for wmd has had major geopolitical repercussions .
we need to make sure the agents and agencies in our society which would seek to amplify climate change risks do not lead us down a similar counter-productive pathway .
the ipcc scenarios of future climate change - warming somewhere between 1.4 and 5.8 celsius by 2100 - are significant enough without invoking catastrophe and chaos as unguided weapons with which forlornly to threaten society into behavioural change .
i believe climate change is real , must be faced and action taken .
but the discourse of catastrophe is in danger of tipping society onto a negative , depressive and reactionary trajectory . "

the 1980s pop singer and style icon was among 1,224 people who created a new record for the largest gathering of people with the same surname .
she also entertained her namesakes at the wales millennium centre .
the previous same-surname record was set in sweden two years ago by a gathering of 583 people called norberg .
jones is the most common surname in wales and is generally considered to be derived from the term " son of john " .
it has been ... an unforgettable international celebration of the jones clan iona jones , s4c 's chief executive it is also a common name in the united states , canada , australia and new zealand .
those who took part in the show included opera singers dame gwyneth jones and gwyn hughes jones and west end star john owen-jones .
grace jones performed two songs , with a costume change in between them , finishing with her club hit pull up to the bumper .
a host of other joneses including the fictional jones family from welsh soap pobol y cwm also took part .
special messages from sir tom jones , whose real name is thomas woodward , and fellow singers bryn terfel jones and aled jones were read out .
blue peter presenter gethin jones and former s4c presenter gwenllian jones who travelled from sydney in australia co-hosted the evening .
joneses arrived in cardiff from all over wales and further afield joneses from across wales and as far away as australia descended on the capital city to make up the audience .
one american tour company even organised a special trip to wales so that joneses living there could play a part in the show .
the evening was regulated by a strict door policy , with all those attending asked to provide identification and present it to independent witnesses .
hyphenated or maiden names did not count , and all joneses had to prove their identity to scrutineers from the guinness book of records .
iona jones , chief executive of s4c which will screen the jones jones jones show on 26 november , said afterwards : " it has been a wonderful record-breaking evening of entertainment and an unforgettable international celebration of the jones clan . "
the attempt was watched closely by the current record holders steve jones , professor of genetics at university college london , said jones derived from john , and was popular because of the welsh habit of naming themselves after their father .
he said : " in the 18th century lots of people were called john and so anybody whose father was called john would become jones and they 'd be no more related than say the son of john major to the son of john travolta . "
jones is the most common last name in wales , accounting for 13.5 % of the population .
the name has become so prevalent in the english-speaking world that the phrase " keeping up with the joneses , " which refers to someone trying to maintain the same social status as their neighbours or contemporaries , is widely understood .

the move comes a day after prosecutors said they had enough evidence to charge him with corruption - even though he is protected by presidential immunity .
on friday , they charged his wife and three former presidential aides with the alleged misuse of state funds .
president chen has been undermined by a series of scandals involving his family and his office in recent months .
he has lost the people 's trust and respect ma ying-jeou opposition nationalist party taiwanese give their reaction he has already survived two opposition attempts to remove him from office , including one last month .
the governing democratic progressive party has urged the president to explain himself in public - and an aide to mr chen said he was to deliver a speech within two days .
however , one of his former allies , shih ming-teh , led an unauthorised protest in taipei on saturday to press demands for the president to step down .
there were minor scuffles with the police outside mr chen 's office .
shih ming-teh has been leading several of the protests the main opposition parties have said that if the president does not resign , they willd launch a third attempt in parliament next week to force him out of office .
members of the small taiwan solidarity union political party , a former ally of the president 's democratic progressive party or dpp , have said that if the motion is tabled , they would vote along with the opposition .
many dpp members have argued that president chen has become too much of a liability and should be replaced before the 2008 presidential elections , says the bbc 's caroline gluck in taipei .
secret fund the charges relate to the handling of a secret presidential fund used for diplomatic work overseas .
officials say about $ 500,000 could not be properly accounted for .
during the four-month investigation , officials looked at six separate cases involving the use of the fund .
they said the president 's explanation for two were verified , but three were questionable and one was described as pure fiction .
scandal timeline march 2004 : president chen narrowly wins re-election may 2006 : president 's son-in-law held over insider trading claims .
charged in july allegations of improper conduct involving chen 's wife and senior aides also surface june : chen cedes some powers to pm amid outcry unprecedented opposition motion to oust him , which fails september : two weeks of pro and anti-chen marches opposition launch new bid to recall chen .
again fails october : wu shu-chen cleared of accepting shop vouchers in return for influence november : wu shu-chen charged with corruption over handling of secret presidential funds prosecutors say enough evidence to indict chen , but he is protected by presidential immunity after charging the first lady - who has previously denied any wrongdoing - the prosecutor 's office said " evidence also showed chen is suspected of graft and forgery " .
" but since he is protected by constitution against criminal charges , he can only be prosecuted after he leaves office , " chang wen-cheng , of the prosecutor 's office , said .
president chen has been facing growing calls for his resignation in recent months over the scandals to hit his family and office .
last month , wu shu-chen was cleared of accepting vouchers from a department store in return for her influence .
in may , her son-in-law , chao chien-ming , was arrested and later charged with insider trading .

the nine-hole course , supported by newport council , would be built at the end of an existing driving range at the community course in caerleon .
the council has agreed to put £ 100,000 towards the £ 225,000 project with the remainding funding yet to be granted .
it is also intended to build on the growing interest in the sport ahead of the europe vs us elite event .
one player who is backing the need for the course is 18-year-old golfer chris pritchard , from newport , who recently won a golf scholarship with an american university . "
golf is often perceived as an elitist sport , but we want to make sure everyone has the same opportunities to start playing the game " cllr ron jones " having a facility like that would be such a good idea , it would give young people the chance to have a go and to practice , " he said .
" i started playing when i was about 13 and the facilities on offer then were n't very good but they are getting better .
" there are a lot more young people taking up the sport , i think its got to do with things like the welsh open and of course the ryder cup . "
further backing is being sought from the ryder cup legacy fund , set up to help develop grassroots golf facilities .
the course is also subject to planning permission .
since 1999 , the course has been run by caerleon golf club under a voluntary management agreement with the council .
it is hoped the scheme will provide opportunities for partnerships with the celtic manor resort , where the ryder cup will being held , and local clubs .
councillor ron jones said : " golf is often perceived as an elitist sport , but we want to make sure everyone has the same opportunities to start playing the game .
" we have a good relationship with the club and this new facility will offer youngsters in newport the chance to try the sport and develop their game on a par three course . "
image change brian davies , manager for golf development in wales , said statistics showed that golf membership levels in wales for boys and girls were the highest ever .
he said : " there has been about a 17 % rise in the numbers of girls and there are around 7,500 boys playing .
" getting courses like the one planned in caerleon is a good way of encouraging them to play .
" there is a big problem when you are a beginner at any age to go onto the main course proper because it can be very discouraging and daunting when you have to try and hit the ball 20 times for example . "

police and hunt monitors were out checking people stayed within the law .
hunting foxes with dogs in england and wales was banned in 2005 but hounds can be used to follow an artificial scent .
supporters said they would test the " ridiculous law " to its limits while anti-hunt protesters warned more hunters could be prosecuted .
under the new guidelines , dogs can also be used to flush out a fox , which can then be killed by a bird of prey or shot - as long as only two dogs are involved in the process .
loopholes exploited tim easby , master and huntsman of the middleton hunt in north yorkshire , told the bbc they had never had so much support and it had been " absolutely fantastic " .
mr easby said he was confident the " ridiculous " ban on hunting with hounds would be overturned because of the popularity of the sport .
" we will be going on hound exercise and laying trails and , to all intent and purposes , the mounted field behind me will be having as much fun doing that as they 've always had , " he said .
bbc rural affairs correspondent tom heap said some claimed the appeal of hunting had increased .
" all hunts are exploiting loopholes in the law and how far they can push it depends on the local level of scrutiny , " he said . "
we 're testing it to the limits because we see it as a ridiculous law that should never have been brought in " phillippa mayo countryside alliance " some undoubtedly chase and kill foxes with a pack of hounds in clear breach of the law .
" others may lay scent trails by hand and only pursue live prey by accident . "
phillippa mayo , from the countryside alliance , told bbc radio five live hunts were trying to operate within the law .
" they 're certainly not going out to deliberately flout it , but obviously we 're testing it to the limits because we see it as a ridiculous law that should never have been brought in and which needs repealing as soon as possible , " she said .
mike hobday , of the league against cruel sports , warned more hunt supporters could be prosecuted if they did not follow the law .
" if hunters do not convert to drag hunting , following an artificial scent , we foresee more ending up in court , " he said .
" the hunting act is very clear - the cruelty of chasing wild animals with hounds is illegal , " he said .
national trust ban on saturday , the national trust 's annual meeting was due to discuss a resolution calling for it to reaffirm the total ban on hunters on its land .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive of the league against cruel sports -lrb- lacs -rrb- and a member of the national trust , was due to propose the resolution with fellow-member cerys roberts .
the trust banned all deer hunting on its land in 1997 .
have your say " the law on foxhunting is just a bureaucratic farce " roy , eastbourne send us your comments however , the trustees resolved that where hunts chasing " clearly sick and injured deer " cross on to its land , the hunters and their hounds should be allowed to follow and kill the deer in order to be humane .
" this is a concept as ludicrous as asking a known paedophile to supervise a children 's playground , " said mr batchelor .
he added : " these are people whose hobby is pursuing , on horseback , terrified animals , chasing them to exhaustion and then butchering them .
