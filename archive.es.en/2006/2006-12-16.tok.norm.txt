whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis .

in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .

the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .

whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.12.2006 opinion : a dim hope for palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian president mahmoud abbas has called for new elections to solve the current crisis .
but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .
triggered by the developments and events in the middle east , this sobering realization must have spread particularly in the united states last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take iraq : one year after the first , truly free election , the situation there is now worse than ever .
everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .
why should it be different in palestine the second time around ? middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu criticizes world powers for failures in middle east european union lawmakers on thursday denounced world powers for a failure to tackle the ongoing middle east crisis , highlighting the inaction of the united states to push for peace in the palestinian-israel conflict .
-lrb- 17.11.2006 -rrb- eu cautiously optimistic on possible new palestinian government eu foreign policy leaders expressed hope that a new palestinian government could help revive middle east peace negotiations .
the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? -lrb- 14.11.2006 -rrb- solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .

" if the germans want money for the property they lost they should address their demands to the us , britain and the heirs of the soviet union , " said wladyslaw bartoszewski , a former foreign minister of poland . these three states decided the fate of the ethnic german population in the regions of silesia , pomerania and east prussia , he told the polish newspaper rzeczpospolita . bartoszewski was referring to the 1945 potsdam agreement which among other things redrafted germany 's borders , giving control of east prussia , silesia and part of pomerania to poland . no support from german officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan is president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border in germany , too , government officials said they hoped that this most recent compensation claim would not find support . " i expect other politically relevant forces will distance themselves from this action , including the german federation of expellees , " said gesine schwan , the berlin government 's coordinator for relations with poland . erika steinbach , who heads the federation , said that her organization would not back the compensation claims . markus meckel , a foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , called on the government to withhold all support for the legal action . the prussian trust said its first claim covering 22 separate cases was submitted to the strasbourg court on nov .

" we observe in germany a process deeper than a simple attitude of one government or another , " he said in an interview with rzeczpospolita .
" it 's a re-nationalization of politics , an exceptionally radical calling into question of historical judgements . " in his strongest attack on germany since coming to power , the polish prime minister lamented " the obvious anti-polish sentiment , that 's often racist , of some germans . " talking about the prussian trust 's claim , kaczynski said he expected the german government to take a stronger stance . " germany has n't fully explained its legal position faced with property in poland , " he said .
" its declarations in this area remain insufficient . " he deplored the fact that german chancellor angela merkel has rejected his proposal to sign a bilateral treaty to mutually abandon future financial claims . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we 're really way ahead of the politicians " polish journalist adam krzeminski on thursday will be honored for his efforts to improve german-polish relations .

soon tourists will be able to spend their vacation there .
much of the architecture has already been landmarked . the state government in north rhine-westphalia decided this week to back the development of the former nazi elite school " vogelsang " into a significant tourist destination . located in the eifel region in northwestern germany , the location is to offer exhibitions , gastronomy , educational facilities and a tourist information center . the state and the federal government , which owns the property , are expected to work out the financial details by march 2007 , said a spokesperson from the state ministry of finance .

" big hotels and vacation facilities would compete with tourism in the surrounding communities , which should be supported and not threatened . " many have already visited during the third reich , the nazis built three such elite educational centers .
the " vogelsang " facility was first used for political and military training before it was taken over by the " wehrmacht , " the nazi army , in 1939 . after world war ii , the 70,000 square-meter -lrb- 753,474 square-foot -rrb- national park was put to use as a training ground for the belgian military , but abandoned in october 2005 . since it was opened to the public in early 2006 , some 160,000 tourists have already visited the site - in particular to view the architecture , which is considered to be exemplary of national socialist style and much of which is under monument protection . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vogelsang castle : in the shadow of the third reich young men were molded into nazi leaders of the future at vogelsang castle in the rhineland .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .

much of the architecture has already been landmarked . the state government in north rhine-westphalia decided this week to back the development of the former nazi elite school " vogelsang " into a significant tourist destination . located in the eifel region in northwestern germany , the location is to offer exhibitions , gastronomy , educational facilities and a tourist information center . the state and the federal government , which owns the property , are expected to work out the financial details by march 2007 , said a spokesperson from the state ministry of finance .
private investors are also being sought to help cover the 20 million euro -lrb- $ 26.4 million -rrb- price tag . controversial decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eifel , rich in natural beauty , is already a popular vacation destination not all of the state officials agreed with the decision to transform the former nazi school into a tourist attraction . " the national park center is not an amusement park , " said reiner priggen , chairman of the green party in north rhine-westphalia .
" big hotels and vacation facilities would compete with tourism in the surrounding communities , which should be supported and not threatened . " many have already visited during the third reich , the nazis built three such elite educational centers .
the " vogelsang " facility was first used for political and military training before it was taken over by the " wehrmacht , " the nazi army , in 1939 . after world war ii , the 70,000 square-meter -lrb- 753,474 square-foot -rrb- national park was put to use as a training ground for the belgian military , but abandoned in october 2005 . since it was opened to the public in early 2006 , some 160,000 tourists have already visited the site - in particular to view the architecture , which is considered to be exemplary of national socialist style and much of which is under monument protection . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vogelsang castle : in the shadow of the third reich young men were molded into nazi leaders of the future at vogelsang castle in the rhineland .

whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .

but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .
triggered by the developments and events in the middle east , this sobering realization must have spread particularly in the united states last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take iraq : one year after the first , truly free election , the situation there is now worse than ever .
everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors .

" if the germans want money for the property they lost they should address their demands to the us , britain and the heirs of the soviet union , " said wladyslaw bartoszewski , a former foreign minister of poland . these three states decided the fate of the ethnic german population in the regions of silesia , pomerania and east prussia , he told the polish newspaper rzeczpospolita . bartoszewski was referring to the 1945 potsdam agreement which among other things redrafted germany 's borders , giving control of east prussia , silesia and part of pomerania to poland . no support from german officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan is president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border in germany , too , government officials said they hoped that this most recent compensation claim would not find support . " i expect other politically relevant forces will distance themselves from this action , including the german federation of expellees , " said gesine schwan , the berlin government 's coordinator for relations with poland . erika steinbach , who heads the federation , said that her organization would not back the compensation claims . markus meckel , a foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , called on the government to withhold all support for the legal action . the prussian trust said its first claim covering 22 separate cases was submitted to the strasbourg court on nov .

" we observe in germany a process deeper than a simple attitude of one government or another , " he said in an interview with rzeczpospolita .
" it 's a re-nationalization of politics , an exceptionally radical calling into question of historical judgements . " in his strongest attack on germany since coming to power , the polish prime minister lamented " the obvious anti-polish sentiment , that 's often racist , of some germans . " talking about the prussian trust 's claim , kaczynski said he expected the german government to take a stronger stance . " germany has n't fully explained its legal position faced with property in poland , " he said .
" its declarations in this area remain insufficient . " he deplored the fact that german chancellor angela merkel has rejected his proposal to sign a bilateral treaty to mutually abandon future financial claims . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we 're really way ahead of the politicians " polish journalist adam krzeminski on thursday will be honored for his efforts to improve german-polish relations .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .

soon tourists will be able to spend their vacation there .
much of the architecture has already been landmarked . the state government in north rhine-westphalia decided this week to back the development of the former nazi elite school " vogelsang " into a significant tourist destination . located in the eifel region in northwestern germany , the location is to offer exhibitions , gastronomy , educational facilities and a tourist information center . the state and the federal government , which owns the property , are expected to work out the financial details by march 2007 , said a spokesperson from the state ministry of finance .
private investors are also being sought to help cover the 20 million euro -lrb- $ 26.4 million -rrb- price tag . controversial decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eifel , rich in natural beauty , is already a popular vacation destination not all of the state officials agreed with the decision to transform the former nazi school into a tourist attraction . " the national park center is not an amusement park , " said reiner priggen , chairman of the green party in north rhine-westphalia .
" big hotels and vacation facilities would compete with tourism in the surrounding communities , which should be supported and not threatened . " many have already visited during the third reich , the nazis built three such elite educational centers .
the " vogelsang " facility was first used for political and military training before it was taken over by the " wehrmacht , " the nazi army , in 1939 . after world war ii , the 70,000 square-meter -lrb- 753,474 square-foot -rrb- national park was put to use as a training ground for the belgian military , but abandoned in october 2005 . since it was opened to the public in early 2006 , some 160,000 tourists have already visited the site - in particular to view the architecture , which is considered to be exemplary of national socialist style and much of which is under monument protection . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vogelsang castle : in the shadow of the third reich young men were molded into nazi leaders of the future at vogelsang castle in the rhineland .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .
-lrb- 09.07.2006 -rrb- jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .
-lrb- 07.04.2006 -rrb- klinsi : warring keepers to be separated german national coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to keep goalkeeping rivals oliver kahn and jens lehmann apart for the next six warm-up matches to prevent further friction building up ahead of the 2006 world cup .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .
we can not correct the mistakes that have probably been made over many years .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .
-lrb- 09.07.2006 -rrb- jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .
-lrb- 07.04.2006 -rrb- klinsi : warring keepers to be separated german national coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to keep goalkeeping rivals oliver kahn and jens lehmann apart for the next six warm-up matches to prevent further friction building up ahead of the 2006 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .
-lrb- 09.07.2006 -rrb- jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .
-lrb- 07.04.2006 -rrb- klinsi : warring keepers to be separated german national coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to keep goalkeeping rivals oliver kahn and jens lehmann apart for the next six warm-up matches to prevent further friction building up ahead of the 2006 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .

much of the architecture has already been landmarked . the state government in north rhine-westphalia decided this week to back the development of the former nazi elite school " vogelsang " into a significant tourist destination . located in the eifel region in northwestern germany , the location is to offer exhibitions , gastronomy , educational facilities and a tourist information center . the state and the federal government , which owns the property , are expected to work out the financial details by march 2007 , said a spokesperson from the state ministry of finance .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself . " i see no reason to believe that the quality of goalkeepers is declining , " said köpke . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a giant bows out after his first and only appearance in the tournament , oliver kahn , the man who towered over german soccer – both on and off the pitch – announced to the world that he would retire from international competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .

but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .

everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .

but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .
triggered by the developments and events in the middle east , this sobering realization must have spread particularly in the united states last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take iraq : one year after the first , truly free election , the situation there is now worse than ever .
everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors .

" the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .
we can not correct the mistakes that have probably been made over many years .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors .

" the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .

" if the germans want money for the property they lost they should address their demands to the us , britain and the heirs of the soviet union , " said wladyslaw bartoszewski , a former foreign minister of poland . these three states decided the fate of the ethnic german population in the regions of silesia , pomerania and east prussia , he told the polish newspaper rzeczpospolita . bartoszewski was referring to the 1945 potsdam agreement which among other things redrafted germany 's borders , giving control of east prussia , silesia and part of pomerania to poland . no support from german officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan is president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border in germany , too , government officials said they hoped that this most recent compensation claim would not find support . " i expect other politically relevant forces will distance themselves from this action , including the german federation of expellees , " said gesine schwan , the berlin government 's coordinator for relations with poland . erika steinbach , who heads the federation , said that her organization would not back the compensation claims . markus meckel , a foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats , called on the government to withhold all support for the legal action . the prussian trust said its first claim covering 22 separate cases was submitted to the strasbourg court on nov .

" we observe in germany a process deeper than a simple attitude of one government or another , " he said in an interview with rzeczpospolita .
" it 's a re-nationalization of politics , an exceptionally radical calling into question of historical judgements . " in his strongest attack on germany since coming to power , the polish prime minister lamented " the obvious anti-polish sentiment , that 's often racist , of some germans . " talking about the prussian trust 's claim , kaczynski said he expected the german government to take a stronger stance . " germany has n't fully explained its legal position faced with property in poland , " he said .
" its declarations in this area remain insufficient .

but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .
triggered by the developments and events in the middle east , this sobering realization must have spread particularly in the united states last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take iraq : one year after the first , truly free election , the situation there is now worse than ever .
everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .
why should it be different in palestine the second time around ? middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu criticizes world powers for failures in middle east european union lawmakers on thursday denounced world powers for a failure to tackle the ongoing middle east crisis , highlighting the inaction of the united states to push for peace in the palestinian-israel conflict .
-lrb- 17.11.2006 -rrb- eu cautiously optimistic on possible new palestinian government eu foreign policy leaders expressed hope that a new palestinian government could help revive middle east peace negotiations .

whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .
triggered by the developments and events in the middle east , this sobering realization must have spread particularly in the united states last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take iraq : one year after the first , truly free election , the situation there is now worse than ever .
everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .

a solid defense is built on the foundation of a good goalie .
however , a surprising amount of goalkeeping errors this season has exposed a number of defensive rocks as having feet of clay . back in the old days , germany had a world class national team goalkeeper who held the job for club and country until the end of his career . but this era appears to be at an end following jens lehmann 's selection over stalwart oliver kahn for the 2006 world cup .
the decision to swap out goalkeepers at the drop of a hat - or a ball - now seems to have been the start of a trend that the bundesliga may be following as well . while arsenal 's lehmann was picked by coach jürgen klinsmann because of his expertise in making the game flow faster than bayern munich 's kahn , the changes between the posts at many clubs in the bundesliga come after an unprecedented series of errors . " goalkeepers in crisis , " kicker magazine exclaimed monday in an article that detailed the chopping and changing going on at a number of bundesliga sides . bundesliga seeing unprecedented changes at no. 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bench may be more comfortable than the pitch five clubs have already changed their man between the posts this season , and half a dozen recent blunders further highlight the issue - led by the latest stunt by tomislav piplica of energie cottbus , who headed a free kick from munich 's bastian schweinsteiger into his own net . " the number of changes is unique for the league , " said former sv hamburg and eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper uli stein . sv hamburg went from stefan wächter to sascha kirschstein and back to wächter , but the switches have failed to halt a slide that sees them languishing in 17th place . bottom club mainz 05 benched veteran dimo wache and replaced him with christian wetklo in the away match at borussia mönchengladbach last week .
the new man blundered for the hosts ' goal before mainz got a 1-1draw .
" the little error did n't matter - before that he saved us , " insisted mainz coach jürgen klopp . wache admitted that " the situation is n't easy if you have been first choice for 11 years . " experience counts for little when dropping the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball went one way , the keeper and his career the other the statement could be echoed by schalke 04 's frank rost , who suddenly finds himself benched , with newcomer manuel neuer now coach mirko slomka 's first choice keeper . neuer has let in just six goals in nine games in which schalke won 23 of a possible 27 points to rank level on points with league leaders werder bremen .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said 20-year-old neuer .
kicker dedicated two pages to neuer 's rise to prominence under the headline " a new lehmann ? " other goalkeeping aspiring to succeed lehmann one day are not doing so well either , with bremen 's tim wiese , robert enke of hanover , dortmund 's roman weidenfeller and simon jentzsch of wolfsburg not flawless last weekend . no goalie crisis , claims national keeper coach germany goalkeeper coach andreas köpke dismissed the idea that the series of errors could have a negative effect on the national team which in the past has seen such greats as kahn , toni schumacher , sepp maier and köpke himself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.12.2006 germany debates the future of coal mining großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of miners at risk of unemployment some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future . german hard coal stopped making money a long time ago .
whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .
we could also produce it in germany at those prices , " said meer . klaus deuse -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .
german producers of mining machinery employ at least 17,000 people , whose expertise and products are in great demand on a global scale . the total turnover of these 120 mainly small and medium-sized enterprises has risen from 1.5 to 2.3 billion euros since 2000 .
they would have to move their business abroad if german mines were to be totally shut down .
if coal as an energy source does have a flourishing future ahead of it from a global perspective , it might not make sense for germany 's politicians to allow that to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : closing down the mines will damage producers of mining equipment , too professor franz-josef wodopia , the head of the german mining association , said germany has already lost ground in international terms .
" let 's think back a while to our expertise in coal liquefaction and coal gasification - now the south african firm gasol is the know-how expert , " he says .
" gasol is already looking at germany and other countries for ways of exploiting its technology there . " coke extraction is another area where germany may have lost out .
" we 've seen that the price of coke has exploded and is now at $ 400 -lrb- 300 euros -rrb- a ton .

whereas the price for a metric ton of coal on the world market is 60 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- the cost of extracting one ton in germany is 165 euros .
the german hard-coal mining industry would not survive without subsidies worth billions of euros .
the political pressure to shut down the mines is growing . yet , germany 's federal institute for geosciences and natural resources recently reported that in 25 years coal will be the most important energy source worldwide , stating that by 2030 the oil extraction peak would have been reached and the availability of natural gases would be more limited than is often assumed . these two conflicting points have been hotly debated in germany , particularly as the federal government prepared this week for an end of december meeting between politicians and industry representatives to find common ground on coal .
the pressing question is whether the german mining industry has a future and , if it does , at what cost . 10 million euros a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's last eight functioning mines are set to close seven of germany 's eight functioning mines are located in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , which is led by a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which has a small percentage of seats in the parliament , wants to reform the costly mining industry as soon as possible .
the state 's mines receive 2.5 billion euros per year from the federal and state budgets . the mining industry guzzles 10 million euros per day , according to calculations by the diw economics research institute .
that amount would suffice to finance one of germany 's fraunhofer institutes - where research into new technologies is conducted - for an entire year , the diw said . many of north rhine-westphalia 's politicians believe hard coal mining should be reduced or even stopped .
they claim that the faster the mines are shut , the more money there will be for the promotion of new technologies . however , the trade unions are not convinced .
" i think it is a completely false , short-sighted decision , " said christoph meer , a spokesman for germany 's mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- igbce -rrb- . the igbce is pushing for mining output to be kept constant in at least two or three mines , maintaining an extraction capacity of up to 10 million tons a year .
the union also argues that this is necessary for ensuring there are enough energy supplies for the nation . " the most important reason is security of supply and , above all , the possibility to access german pits , " says christoph meer " if we give up the pits for good it will be at least a decade until the coal can be got at again .
that 's surely not how to combat the energy crisis . " there are enough coal reserves worldwide to last 140 years - much longer than natural oil and gas reserves . from economic miracle to unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal contributed to germany 's economic miracle germany 's economic miracle in the 1950s was first made possible by coal .
in 1957 , about 600,000 miners extracted 150 million tons of coal in over 100 mining shafts .
then , at the beginning of the 1970s , the coal crisis led to the closing of 78 mines and the number of employed minors sank to 200,000 . since then , the coal mining industry has been constantly downsized by political measures .
survival has been possible only thanks to massive subsidies . " if everything is shut down by 2012 , as the fdp wants , it will mean 10,000 miners losing their jobs , " warned meer from the igcbe . under current socio-political conditions , the reduction of mine production would not be possible until 2018 , at the very earliest , without cutting jobs .
the german steinkohle -lrb- dsk -rrb- mining company still employs 35,000 miners . however , other companies also make their living from the mining industry , such as truckers or producers of mining equipment .
closing down the mines would thus entail the loss of 80,000 jobs .

" if the germans want money for the property they lost they should address their demands to the us , britain and the heirs of the soviet union , " said wladyslaw bartoszewski , a former foreign minister of poland . these three states decided the fate of the ethnic german population in the regions of silesia , pomerania and east prussia , he told the polish newspaper rzeczpospolita . bartoszewski was referring to the 1945 potsdam agreement which among other things redrafted germany 's borders , giving control of east prussia , silesia and part of pomerania to poland . no support from german officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan is president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border in germany , too , government officials said they hoped that this most recent compensation claim would not find support .

" we observe in germany a process deeper than a simple attitude of one government or another , " he said in an interview with rzeczpospolita .
" it 's a re-nationalization of politics , an exceptionally radical calling into question of historical judgements . " in his strongest attack on germany since coming to power , the polish prime minister lamented " the obvious anti-polish sentiment , that 's often racist , of some germans . " talking about the prussian trust 's claim , kaczynski said he expected the german government to take a stronger stance . " germany has n't fully explained its legal position faced with property in poland , " he said .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .
we can not correct the mistakes that have probably been made over many years .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .
we can not correct the mistakes that have probably been made over many years . " germany has 2,750 peacekeepers serving with the international security assistance force in afghanistan and commands the section of the force operating in the north of the country . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two german soldiers avoid charges in skull photo scandal two german soldiers who photographed each other in obscene poses with skulls in afghanistan will not face criminal charges , as the remains were not found in a cemetery , prosecutors said .

but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .
triggered by the developments and events in the middle east , this sobering realization must have spread particularly in the united states last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take iraq : one year after the first , truly free election , the situation there is now worse than ever .
everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .
we can not correct the mistakes that have probably been made over many years . " germany has 2,750 peacekeepers serving with the international security assistance force in afghanistan and commands the section of the force operating in the north of the country . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two german soldiers avoid charges in skull photo scandal two german soldiers who photographed each other in obscene poses with skulls in afghanistan will not face criminal charges , as the remains were not found in a cemetery , prosecutors said .

but dw 's peter philipp argues that the chances for success are slim . democracy without free elections is unimaginable , but that 's not to say that free elections bring about democracy .
triggered by the developments and events in the middle east , this sobering realization must have spread particularly in the united states last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take iraq : one year after the first , truly free election , the situation there is now worse than ever .
everything moves towards civil war at such a pace that even critics of the us occupation warn that a swift withdrawal would create just more chaos .
the saudis , who usually like to stay out of everything , have warned that they would completely support iraqi sunnis in case of a us withdrawal . in baghdad , people now try to demonstrate national unity and reconciliation .
but that 's as unlikely to succeed as in lebanon : there , free elections also took place .
an inclusive coalition government is now under the massive pressure of the islamist hezbollah and her allies to grant them a minority veto power in government .
many worry that a new civil war will be the alternative . that 's exactly what palestinians fear for the autonomous territories .
president mahmoud abbas hopes to prevent such a development by holding new elections in the very near future .
hamas spokespeople accuse abbas of abusing his powers in an unconstitutional way and have already announced their resistance against this " coup from above . "
this , too , could lead to civil war . even if that 's not the case , it 's more than questionable whether new elections will solve the problem .
hamas was elected in january , because people were tired of the corrupt plo , because the peace process had not brought results and because the despair in the palestinian territories had apparently reached boiling point .
apparently .
it 's become much worse since then . as hamas does not uphold the plo 's agreements with israel and refuses to recognize israel , the government is boycotted by the west and does not receive desperately needed financial aid .
officials smuggle arab and iranian donations into the country , but that 's no way to govern .
attempts to form a broad coalition of nonpartisan experts all failed .
following attacks from both sides - including one on premier haniya - abbas seems to have come to the conclusion that only presidential and parliamentary elections can bring salvation . it 's a dim hope , as elections alone have not turned things around in iraq nor in lebanon .
why should it be different in palestine the second time around ? middle east ex per t peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu criticizes world powers for failures in middle east european union lawmakers on thursday denounced world powers for a failure to tackle the ongoing middle east crisis , highlighting the inaction of the united states to push for peace in the palestinian-israel conflict .

four other lower-ranking soldiers avoided courts-martial when it became clear that superiors did not hinder them from posing with the human remains . state prosecutors opened criminal investigations against 23 soldiers but have decided not to charge any of them .
six soldiers have been suspended from the military over the pictures . the prosecutor 's office in munich last week said two of the main culprits in the affair had taken human remains from a lime field outside kabul , rather than from a cemetery , and could therefore not be charged with desecrating graves . it said the area near the afghan capital was strewn with skeletons , presumably those of russian soldiers who died during the soviet occupation of the central asian country in the 1980s . bundeswehr training to be altered bundeswehr general inspector wolfgang schneiderhan said he intended to make changes in ethical and moral training given to middle and high-ranking officers as a consequence of the so-called skull scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , left , and bundeswehr head schneiderhan " overall , our training is good and appropriate , " he said friday in an interview with the online version of die welt newspaper .
" the young superiors have to have the courage to intervene when mistakes are made , even when it is not easy . " schneiderhan also submitted a three-page report to german defense minister franz josef jung , outlining how he intended to prevent similar occurrences in the future .
schneiderhan , however , also said that the bundeswehr should not be considered a " school for the country . " " obviously the internalization of morals laid out in the constitution are no longer an obvious result of parental and school education , " he said .
" we in the bundeswehr are not a school for the nation .
we can not correct the mistakes that have probably been made over many years . " germany has 2,750 peacekeepers serving with the international security assistance force in afghanistan and commands the section of the force operating in the north of the country . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two german soldiers avoid charges in skull photo scandal two german soldiers who photographed each other in obscene poses with skulls in afghanistan will not face criminal charges , as the remains were not found in a cemetery , prosecutors said .

however , the authority wants chief constable richard brunstrom to present a detailed business plan first .
authority members said they wanted to be sure the four police horse unit can be funded without it having an adverse affect on neighbourhood policing .
at present mounted officers are bought in from merseyside police as needed .
thirteen authority members voted in favour - with two abstentions - at an authority meeting in colwyn bay .
several members had voiced concerns about whether it was an appropriate time to introduce a mounted section when 120 civilian jobs were being axed because the force faced a cash crisis .
however , mr brunstrom said a mounted section of four horses was an idea whose time had come .
it was possible that a very good deal could be reached with the national trust to stable the horses at erddig , near wrexham , he said , and to share the facility with cheshire police .
there was also the possibility of sponsorship .
mr brunstrom said that police horses were highly effective and had a huge and manpower-saving impact and that now was the right time to introduce them .
officers and horses hired from merseyside are being used in north wales over the christmas period .

their modelling suggests emissions of co2 will produce a 3 % reduction in the density of the thermosphere by 2017 .
with less drag on them , satellites and space junk will stay in orbit longer .
so , while space agencies can count on using reduced fuel loads to keep their missions going in future , the risks their spacecraft face from being hit by debris will increase .
" in both cases it makes them last longer ; it 's a bit of a two-edged sword , " said dr solomon , a senior scientist at the national center for atmospheric research .
the issue was discussed at this week 's american geophysical union fall meeting .
very thin it is one of the peculiarities of atmospheric chemistry that the presence of carbon dioxide at low altitudes has a warming effect , whereas at high altitudes , it has a cooling effect .
this paradox occurs because the air thins with height .
in the lowest parts of the atmosphere , co2 traps infrared radiation very efficiently and causes the well-known " greenhouse " warming effect .
in higher parts of the atmosphere , however , infrequent collisions between gas molecules mean co2 can more readily radiate heat out to space , thereby causing a cooling effect .
as it cools , the thermosphere settles , so that the density at a given height is also reduced .
" the densities we 're talking about are -lsb- a billionth of the densities -rsb- at the surface , " explained professor robert dickinson , from georgia institute of technology , atlanta .
" this is a much higher vacuum than the vacuums people create in laboratories .
however , there are still molecules up there and it can still be treated , on a very large scale , as an atmosphere . "
un action the cooling and thinning , which has already been observed , is projected to continue under the new model as co2 rises .
a reduction in density of 3 % is expected towards the end of the next decade under present trends .
this is significant for many satellites that move just a few hundred kilometres above the earth .
the international space station would not need boosting so often , said dr solomon .
" but at the same time that we are trying to keep important objects in orbit , we still have thousands of defunct objects in orbit , so called space junk , " he added .
" so , as this thermospheric cooling and reduction in density occurs , this space junk will have a longer lifetime and it will become more important in the future to track it , predict it , and to hopefully prevent it . "
fifty years of space activity have left a huge debris field above our heads : spent rocket stages , lost astronaut tools , exploded fragments and the like - even flecks of paint .
there are thought to be 100,000 items the size of a centimetre or bigger swirling around the earth at thousands of kilometres per hour .
if any one of them was to hit an operational spacecraft or astronaut , the consequences would be catastrophic .
" as a technological society , we 're putting more objects up there , " said dr kent tobiska , of space environment technologies in pacific palisades , california .
" for humans and the high-value assets like imaging satellites , it 's a more complex , more difficult and a more dangerous area for them . "
dr tobiska said efforts were being made at the level of the un to try to reduce the amount of redundant material left in orbit .

many other families can not afford to celebrate the festive season , it says .
the charity announced its findings on the 40th anniversary of the broadcast of the homeless drama cathy come home .
" homelessness is devastating all year round but christmas is an especially difficult time , " said john puzey , director of shelter cymru .
" forty years ago , people did n't realise how homelessness and bad housing affects lives , " he said .
if the mortgage rates go up any more it 's a case of thinking , ' i 'm going to have to lose my home ' dawn , home-owner " today , we do know and the problem is greater than ever and it can happen to anyone .
" how can we accept that 35,000 children in wales today are living in unfit housing ?
" for many people , the festive season is special time .
on the other hand , christmas and winter time brings cold , damp misery and suffering . "
repayments one family who have " cancelled christmas " this year because of financial worries is headed by dawn , who did not want to give her full name .
she and her four daughters , one of whom is pregnant , still live in the house she once shared with her former husband .
despite holding down a full time job , dawn can not afford to pay for vital repairs needed to her house and her family help out in paying for food .
" by the time i 've paid the council tax , mortgage and tv licence i 'm left with very little , about £ 20 a week , " she said .
when her former husband left , dawn fell into arrears and was forced to get a new mortgage .
but the interest rate was higher than she could afford and the repayments have continued to increase .
although she has been helped by shelter cymru , she fears she is still close to losing her home .
she said : " if the mortgage rates go up any more it 's a case of thinking , ' i 'm going to have to lose my home ' .
" i 'll never be able to buy another house and at the end of the day , i 'll be blacklisted - i 'll be living in a suitcase going from home to home . "
shelter cymru said it was looking to push the housing issue up the political agenda .
mr puzey said : " with additional resources , imagination and political will , it could be . "
the charity has been gathering evidence for its " 25th birthday inquiry " into homelessness and bad housing , which concludes with a public session at the grand theatre , swansea on 20 december .

the hollywood star told the bbc that the levels of murder and rape convinced him ethnic cleansing was occurring .
at least 200,000 people have died in the region and some 2.5 million are homeless after three years of fighting .
the sharply deteriorating security has led to the withdrawal of 250 relief workers , leaving many vulnerable .
pressure there are also fears that the fighting is destabilising neighbouring chad where there has been an upsurge in violence .
the united nations security council says it is gravely concerned at the situation there and has condemned attempts by rebels to destabilise the government and seize power by force .
in an interview with the bbc 's laura trevelyan in new york , mr clooney said that everyone he met in darfur told of several family members who had been victims of targeted violence .
" that 's not just a war , " he said .
clooney lobbies on darfur q & a : peacekeeping in darfur " that is actually ethnic cleansing . "
he said a larger peacekeeping contingent was immediately needed and called on all rebel factions to sign up to a may ceasefire agreement .
mr clooney also spoke of a recent trip to both egypt and china - two countries which he said could do more to encourage sudan to increase the number of peacekeepers , a proposal that khartoum rejects .
" we think that china has quietly been doing some negotiations ; egypt has been participating in the peace process - we think they can do a lot better , " he told reporters in new york .
accountability in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned sudan would be held accountable if it refused additional troops .
the violence has intensified despite the presence of some 7,000 african union peacekeepers .
" the sudanese need to be convinced that if they are not willing to accept help from the international system , then they 're going to be held accountable for anything that happens , " she told reuters .
also on friday a group of six aid agencies said they had been forced to withdraw from darfur because of the " unprecedented difficulties " of working in the region .
the group - which included oxfam , the international rescue committee , goal , concern , world vision and the norwegian refugee council - said they were becoming direct targets of violence .
the conflict began in early 2003 , when a rebellion by local groups triggered a counter-offensive by the army and government-backed arab militias .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- moneybox -pipe- have your say : revenue blunder bbc news / moneybox graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 16 december 2006 , 10:29 gmt have your say : revenue blunder hm revenue & customs has wrongly told hundreds of thousands of people that there is a hole in their national insurance contribution record .
the bbc discovered the blunder after a number of people contacted money box to say they had been sent letters in error .
hmrc has confirmed its error but can not say how many people are affected .
the institute of payroll professionals estimates it to be 700,000 .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
i received one of these letters and i wrote sending in a copy of my p60 .
because they do not recognise that i have paid my full national insurance , they have failed to forward the ni contributions on to my stakeholder pension company in respect of my opting-out of the government 's second pension .
i am therefore losing investment growth , and have asked them for a date when this money -lrb- approx £ 1,500 -rrb- will be sent and how much compensation they will pay .
richard proudfoot , norwich i sent for a pension forecast 18 months ago .
i was told there was a shortfall in contributions .
i telephoned , i forwarded the relevant p60s .
i have requested two more forecasts in the past year and it still has n't been corrected .
patricia , burnley " in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts " chris , swindon i 'm stunned that this huge ni error for year 2004/2005 is still unresolved as it was known to exist at least since march 2006 as i received a state pension forecast that included this error of £ 371.80 .
when i queried it in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts due to errors from the revenue systems .
yet nine months on they are still making it worse !
chris , swindon i have n't made ni contributions since 1995 .
ironically , i have n't received a letter stating there is a shortfall for year 2004/5 , which makes this situation even more strange .
marion , bristol i received such a letter which was dated a month earlier than the postmark .
i am fully paid up for that year and no , i 'm not sending an original p60 for them to lose or wasting any time filling out forms .
what about other years ?
am i going to reach pension age to be told " sorry love , the latest piece of technology has n't heard of you " .
kay adamson , chester i received one of these letters and just saw red .
i was very angry and especially as i work in the royal household .
do you think my boss would not pay over ni contributions ?
how did these letters get out ?
do we now employ brainless wonders in the civil service ?
surely somebody checks what a computer system is producing ?
anyway , i phoned the helpline and was rather rude .
i have now sent the letter to my mp saying that i want the matter sorted out .
ted shepherd , windsor i do n't suppose they 'll pay any compensation , yet if we 're late with filing , we face a substantial fine .
as much of hmrc 's work is handled by overpaid consultancies , they should forfeit a substantial portion of their fees for each and every blunder !
neil , devizes , uk i work for local government and received my letter a couple of months ago .
i phoned the helpline and was told that due to staff shortages , 04/05 contributions had n't yet been input , so the computer saw the shortfall and sent out the letter .
they said this affected a couple of hundred thousand people and to ignore the letter !
andy , warwick " my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries " robert , coventry my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries .
the consultants who designed the it systems sold them to successive governments .
the chancellor has said he will put an end to " consultancy culture " .
it would be nice if that were to include a review of the major it consultancy and outsourcing failures up to date - but do n't hold your breath .
too many skeletons in too many cupboards for the real culprits ever to be brought to book , i fear .
robert , coventry i got the impression that the erroneous letters are related to people on payroll .
i am a full-time mother , currently in receipt of child benefit and therefore home responsibilities protection .
i have received a letter suggesting a voluntary top-up payment of £ 350 , which does n't make sense to me , as i thought the whole point of hrp was to protect against the inability to make any ni contributions whilst caring for children and out of the paid workforce .
this is the first time i have received such a letter whilst in receipt of hrp .
penny carter , guildford i also received one of these letters .
i was so shocked as i have been in continuous employment throughout those years and knew my contributions were up-to-date .
but as a trusting person , as most people are , it did n't enter my head that the revenue could be wrong .
so i was saving to pay this money to them , but thanks to your programme i do not need to worry now .
june arnold , builth wells powys it is not just people in work who have a problem with 04/05 national insurance records , people who have recently retired are getting less pension then they should because they have no contributions recorded for that year. in some cases it has caused a system fault with additional pension payments and people are thousands of pounds down .
john , swansea when the revenue had previous it problems the press always hammered the us owned company eds -lrb- the previous it contractors -rrb- for the problems .
since the contract is now in the hands of the french owned cap gemini , they are never mentioned when any it problems occur .
why the unfair press ?
living in the town and being an employee of one of the companies where these errors are created , i do have quite some insight into these problems .
laurence , telford to our company 's credit -lrb- edf energy -rrb- they did contact nearly every employee via our payroll and have told us to contact them if we receive a letter from the revenue .
but what will the incompetent revenue do about it and how many other " little errors " have gone unnoticed ?
paul clarkson " errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally " matthew , geneva i work for the foreign and commonwealth office and received one of these letters this week despite my contributions being up to date .
i called the helpline , was put straight through to an assistant and the problem was explained to me clearly and resolved in a matter of minutes .
errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally and not by an automated system .
matthew , geneva my flatmate received one of these and was truly puzzled .
once again a major failure to correctly implement a government it solution .
why are these contractors paid ?
if they make a mistake they should be harshly punished , and if they make a perfect system they should be given bonuses .
ben , london not only did i get the pension letter , i also was prevented by this error from getting jobseekers ' allowance .
when i eventually discovered why , i went with my p60 to prove i had paid the ni .
the job centre staff knew all about the problem and i am still awaiting the allowance five months later .
peter , wokingham i work for ge capital , one of the largest companies in the world and i too have received one of these letters .
i think it is scandalous that the bbc / moneybox has to bring this to our attention .
the revenue should have immediately sent out a letter informing us of this problem .
anon " the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing " bob bowen , weston super mare the revenue admitted to me there was a problem with 2004/5 back in may .
my son , who used to work for me , was denied invalidity allowance because the office he was dealing with said he had no contributions for the year in question .
i had paid all his contributions as i was his employer at the time .
when questioned the revenue said that payments were received and the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing .
he appealed but had all benefits withdrawn because of the gap .
bob bowen , weston super mare another it disaster from a badly designed and badly funded it system .
this at the same time hmrc announce plans to make staff cuts because they say they now have efficient staff-saving computer systems .
karl , chester this bodes well for id cards and the nhs it system does n't it ?
chandra , london i have received one such letter , and i was confident that it was a mistake , as i keep all my records for at least three years .
s jondhale , birmingham government it projects are initiated by ministers and senior managers in the civil service .
seasoned in-house it professionals are not usually involved in the planning stage .
we only get involved at implementation , when changes raise costs significantly and lengthen schedules .
we are then often overruled as the short-term ramifications are politically unacceptable .
no-one really cares about the long term , our current system simply does n't reward long-term thinking .
jay , aylmerton " how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse ? "
richard , milton keynes maybe if the mammoth hm revenue and customs was split into more focussed businesses it would be able to do its job properly .
how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse when the business is all over the place .
richard , milton keynes what about those on benefits ?
my wife is on incapacity benefit and she 's received one of these letters .
alan horn , berkhamsted just one word missing : " sorry " .
not surprising , though .
what incompetence !
what arrogance !
reginald , birmingham income tax £ 4,000 , national insurance £ 1,800 , revenue and customs worthless .
too much bureaucracy , rules no one -lrb- including themselves -rrb- can comprehend , and an attitude of " we do n't make mistakes " .
it 's time the entire incompetent lot was scrapped and replaced by people with brains in their heads .
let 's not forget the repeated tax credits fiascos in addition to this latest example from this hopelessly inept agency .
jim -lrb- born free , taxed to death -rrb- , greater manchester " my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out " adrian richards , nottingham i received one of these letters last september , and i am not in one the groups mentioned .
when i rang , i was told everyone 's record for the same part of that tax year was missing due to a problem with moving records between different computer systems , and they knew there was a big problem .
they said that it would get sorted out over time , but until it was , more letters would be sent out .
because i phoned , my record was corrected within a few days .
since then , my wife has also received a similar letter .
my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out .
but it does make you question everything that the government and its departments are doing .
adrian richards , nottingham this error has been discovered in a timely manner .
how can we be sure when we eventually come to draw our pension that the final calculation will be based on accurate records dating back some 44 to 49 years ?
unless people have kept every p60 between school and retirement , the revenue 's computer 's decision will be final .
kevin geary , radstock i had a similar notice last year relating to payments in 1998 .
it said i had n't paid the stamps for eight months although 1998 was the same throughout .
if i paid the difference i would get full pension .
i then spent considerable time and trouble telling them they were wrong , with which conclusion they agreed .
i still have n't had the difference or even an acknowledgement of the difference .
d smith , dorchester the trouble is that the tax system is simply too complex to be computerised !
maybe they should try simplifying it before using a computer ?
the error is not the computers , by the way , but the overload caused by failing to appreciate how much the system would be overloaded !
most government bodies are optimists !
roger , oxford " staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with " andy , sussex i work for hmrc .
i can confidently state this is not a case of human error .
hmrc and the nhs run two of the largest databases in the world .
staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with , so problems will occur occasionally .
people should also realise that the money given by the government to run hmrc decreases each year , reductions in staff are expected too .
this has been the case for years , and will continue .
there is only so far you can squeeze before the juice starts leaking !
andy , sussex i received one such letter - i 'm a 21 year old student who has n't actually started making pension contributions .
i should imagine that i need to give considerably more than £ 371 .
alice , london always include a copy of the relevant , recent letter which the revenue sent you in any query .
i find it helps !
chris gore , richmond i was made aware of a 2004/05 contribution shortfall when i requested a pension forecast from the pension service in january .
the irony is i work for hmrc !
i wrote to the national insurance contributions office , enclosing a copy of my p60 and it was put right .
their comment ?
" there is a delay in processing your employer 's scheme . "
lesley the phrase " computer error " is nonsense .
it is always used in a pathetic attempt to evade responsibility for a human error .
bob pearson , bourne both my wife , a teacher , and i , a self employed it consultant , who files end of year returns online , have been told we have to pay £ 370 because we are short on ni contributions for 2004/2005 which we are definitely not !
i have written to the revenue but wo n't hold my breath for an answer .
john , southend " i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software " dave , cambridge as a software engineer , i find the comment " they were aware of the error but they ca n't do anything to stop it " sadly comical .
i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software .
dave , cambridge this is now the third incorrect notification i have received from the revenue in three years .
on questioning them , i received a letter saying that on further investigation my records were up to date .
no apology for the waste of time and effort made to try and contact them and send them proof of my payments .
this completely undermines my trust in the system .
no wonder the pensions industry is in such a mess .
julia arnott , amptill , beds the bbc is a bit slow here : lots of us at work got our letters back in october !
fortunately the hmrc helpline was well-prepared -lrb- open until 8pm too -rrb- .
it told us it was a computer glitch and suggested that we ring back in 12 weeks if we had n't been sent a letter saying that they had made a mistake .
sue , bath , somerset computer blunders are very rare , it is usually the people that programme them that cause the problems .
simon mcwade , stockport " our tax system is way too complicated " peter judson , ibstock this is just crazy especially given the fact that the numbers of years required for a full pension based of ni contributions is likely to reduce from 44 for men and 39 for women to 30 years for all .
thus making perhaps all of the 4.7 million letters completely irrelevant !
our tax system is way too complicated , combined with a chancellor making it up as he goes along .
no it system could cope .
peter judson , ibstock it 's a good job hm revenue & customs do n't run parties at breweries !
neil , stockport another government it disaster !
will anyone be held responsible and removed -lrb- downwards or out -rrb- from their post ?
not a chance !
early retirement on a good pension or even promotion is more likely from this government that does so much to reward incompetence !
mark pearson , bicester , oxon the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

the bbc discovered the blunder after a number of people contacted money box to say they had been sent letters in error .
hmrc has confirmed its error but can not say how many people are affected .
the institute of payroll professionals estimates it to be 700,000 .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
i received one of these letters and i wrote sending in a copy of my p60 .
because they do not recognise that i have paid my full national insurance , they have failed to forward the ni contributions on to my stakeholder pension company in respect of my opting-out of the government 's second pension .
i am therefore losing investment growth , and have asked them for a date when this money -lrb- approx £ 1,500 -rrb- will be sent and how much compensation they will pay .
richard proudfoot , norwich i sent for a pension forecast 18 months ago .
i was told there was a shortfall in contributions .
i telephoned , i forwarded the relevant p60s .
i have requested two more forecasts in the past year and it still has n't been corrected .
patricia , burnley in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts chris , swindon i 'm stunned that this huge ni error for year 2004/2005 is still unresolved as it was known to exist at least since march 2006 as i received a state pension forecast that included this error of £ 371.80 .
when i queried it in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts due to errors from the revenue systems .
yet nine months on they are still making it worse !
chris , swindon i have n't made ni contributions since 1995 .
ironically , i have n't received a letter stating there is a shortfall for year 2004/5 , which makes this situation even more strange .
marion , bristol i received such a letter which was dated a month earlier than the postmark .
i am fully paid up for that year and no , i 'm not sending an original p60 for them to lose or wasting any time filling out forms .
what about other years ?

kay adamson , chester i received one of these letters and just saw red .

do we now employ brainless wonders in the civil service ?
surely somebody checks what a computer system is producing ?
anyway , i phoned the helpline and was rather rude .
i have now sent the letter to my mp saying that i want the matter sorted out .
ted shepherd , windsor i do n't suppose they 'll pay any compensation , yet if we 're late with filing , we face a substantial fine .
as much of hmrc 's work is handled by overpaid consultancies , they should forfeit a substantial portion of their fees for each and every blunder !
neil , devizes , uk i work for local government and received my letter a couple of months ago .
i phoned the helpline and was told that due to staff shortages , 04/05 contributions had n't yet been input , so the computer saw the shortfall and sent out the letter .
they said this affected a couple of hundred thousand people and to ignore the letter !
andy , warwick my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries robert , coventry my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries .
the consultants who designed the it systems sold them to successive governments .
the chancellor has said he will put an end to " consultancy culture " .
it would be nice if that were to include a review of the major it consultancy and outsourcing failures up to date - but do n't hold your breath .
too many skeletons in too many cupboards for the real culprits ever to be brought to book , i fear .
robert , coventry i got the impression that the erroneous letters are related to people on payroll .
i am a full-time mother , currently in receipt of child benefit and therefore home responsibilities protection .
i have received a letter suggesting a voluntary top-up payment of £ 350 , which does n't make sense to me , as i thought the whole point of hrp was to protect against the inability to make any ni contributions whilst caring for children and out of the paid workforce .
this is the first time i have received such a letter whilst in receipt of hrp .
penny carter , guildford i also received one of these letters .
i was so shocked as i have been in continuous employment throughout those years and knew my contributions were up-to-date .
but as a trusting person , as most people are , it did n't enter my head that the revenue could be wrong .
so i was saving to pay this money to them , but thanks to your programme i do not need to worry now .
june arnold , builth wells powys it is not just people in work who have a problem with 04/05 national insurance records , people who have recently retired are getting less pension then they should because they have no contributions recorded for that year. in some cases it has caused a system fault with additional pension payments and people are thousands of pounds down .
john , swansea when the revenue had previous it problems the press always hammered the us owned company eds -lrb- the previous it contractors -rrb- for the problems .
since the contract is now in the hands of the french owned cap gemini , they are never mentioned when any it problems occur .
why the unfair press ?
living in the town and being an employee of one of the companies where these errors are created , i do have quite some insight into these problems .
laurence , telford to our company 's credit -lrb- edf energy -rrb- they did contact nearly every employee via our payroll and have told us to contact them if we receive a letter from the revenue .
but what will the incompetent revenue do about it and how many other " little errors " have gone unnoticed ?
paul clarkson errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally matthew , geneva i work for the foreign and commonwealth office and received one of these letters this week despite my contributions being up to date .

matthew , geneva my flatmate received one of these and was truly puzzled .
once again a major failure to correctly implement a government it solution .
why are these contractors paid ?
if they make a mistake they should be harshly punished , and if they make a perfect system they should be given bonuses .
ben , london not only did i get the pension letter , i also was prevented by this error from getting jobseekers ' allowance .
when i eventually discovered why , i went with my p60 to prove i had paid the ni .
the job centre staff knew all about the problem and i am still awaiting the allowance five months later .
peter , wokingham i work for ge capital , one of the largest companies in the world and i too have received one of these letters .
i think it is scandalous that the bbc / moneybox has to bring this to our attention .
the revenue should have immediately sent out a letter informing us of this problem .
anon the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing bob bowen , weston super mare the revenue admitted to me there was a problem with 2004/5 back in may .
my son , who used to work for me , was denied invalidity allowance because the office he was dealing with said he had no contributions for the year in question .
i had paid all his contributions as i was his employer at the time .
when questioned the revenue said that payments were received and the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing .
he appealed but had all benefits withdrawn because of the gap .
bob bowen , weston super mare another it disaster from a badly designed and badly funded it system .
this at the same time hmrc announce plans to make staff cuts because they say they now have efficient staff-saving computer systems .
karl , chester this bodes well for id cards and the nhs it system does n't it ?
chandra , london i have received one such letter , and i was confident that it was a mistake , as i keep all my records for at least three years .
s jondhale , birmingham government it projects are initiated by ministers and senior managers in the civil service .
seasoned in-house it professionals are not usually involved in the planning stage .
we only get involved at implementation , when changes raise costs significantly and lengthen schedules .
we are then often overruled as the short-term ramifications are politically unacceptable .
no-one really cares about the long term , our current system simply does n't reward long-term thinking .

anon the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing bob bowen , weston super mare the revenue admitted to me there was a problem with 2004/5 back in may .
my son , who used to work for me , was denied invalidity allowance because the office he was dealing with said he had no contributions for the year in question .
i had paid all his contributions as i was his employer at the time .
when questioned the revenue said that payments were received and the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing .
he appealed but had all benefits withdrawn because of the gap .
bob bowen , weston super mare another it disaster from a badly designed and badly funded it system .
this at the same time hmrc announce plans to make staff cuts because they say they now have efficient staff-saving computer systems .
karl , chester this bodes well for id cards and the nhs it system does n't it ?
chandra , london i have received one such letter , and i was confident that it was a mistake , as i keep all my records for at least three years .
s jondhale , birmingham government it projects are initiated by ministers and senior managers in the civil service .
seasoned in-house it professionals are not usually involved in the planning stage .
we only get involved at implementation , when changes raise costs significantly and lengthen schedules .
we are then often overruled as the short-term ramifications are politically unacceptable .
no-one really cares about the long term , our current system simply does n't reward long-term thinking .
jay , aylmerton how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse ?
richard , milton keynes maybe if the mammoth hm revenue and customs was split into more focussed businesses it would be able to do its job properly .
how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse when the business is all over the place .
richard , milton keynes what about those on benefits ?
my wife is on incapacity benefit and she 's received one of these letters .
alan horn , berkhamsted just one word missing : " sorry " .
not surprising , though .
what incompetence !
what arrogance !
reginald , birmingham income tax £ 4,000 , national insurance £ 1,800 , revenue and customs worthless .
too much bureaucracy , rules no one -lrb- including themselves -rrb- can comprehend , and an attitude of " we do n't make mistakes " .
it 's time the entire incompetent lot was scrapped and replaced by people with brains in their heads .
let 's not forget the repeated tax credits fiascos in addition to this latest example from this hopelessly inept agency .
jim -lrb- born free , taxed to death -rrb- , greater manchester my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out adrian richards , nottingham i received one of these letters last september , and i am not in one the groups mentioned .
when i rang , i was told everyone 's record for the same part of that tax year was missing due to a problem with moving records between different computer systems , and they knew there was a big problem .
they said that it would get sorted out over time , but until it was , more letters would be sent out .
because i phoned , my record was corrected within a few days .
since then , my wife has also received a similar letter .
my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out .
but it does make you question everything that the government and its departments are doing .
adrian richards , nottingham this error has been discovered in a timely manner .
how can we be sure when we eventually come to draw our pension that the final calculation will be based on accurate records dating back some 44 to 49 years ?
unless people have kept every p60 between school and retirement , the revenue 's computer 's decision will be final .
kevin geary , radstock i had a similar notice last year relating to payments in 1998 .
it said i had n't paid the stamps for eight months although 1998 was the same throughout .
if i paid the difference i would get full pension .
i then spent considerable time and trouble telling them they were wrong , with which conclusion they agreed .
i still have n't had the difference or even an acknowledgement of the difference .
d smith , dorchester the trouble is that the tax system is simply too complex to be computerised !
maybe they should try simplifying it before using a computer ?
the error is not the computers , by the way , but the overload caused by failing to appreciate how much the system would be overloaded !
most government bodies are optimists !
roger , oxford staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with andy , sussex i work for hmrc .
i can confidently state this is not a case of human error .
hmrc and the nhs run two of the largest databases in the world .
staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with , so problems will occur occasionally .
people should also realise that the money given by the government to run hmrc decreases each year , reductions in staff are expected too .
this has been the case for years , and will continue .
there is only so far you can squeeze before the juice starts leaking !
andy , sussex i received one such letter - i 'm a 21 year old student who has n't actually started making pension contributions .
i should imagine that i need to give considerably more than £ 371 .
alice , london always include a copy of the relevant , recent letter which the revenue sent you in any query .
i find it helps !
chris gore , richmond i was made aware of a 2004/05 contribution shortfall when i requested a pension forecast from the pension service in january .
the irony is i work for hmrc !
i wrote to the national insurance contributions office , enclosing a copy of my p60 and it was put right .
their comment ?
" there is a delay in processing your employer 's scheme . "
lesley the phrase " computer error " is nonsense .
it is always used in a pathetic attempt to evade responsibility for a human error .
bob pearson , bourne both my wife , a teacher , and i , a self employed it consultant , who files end of year returns online , have been told we have to pay £ 370 because we are short on ni contributions for 2004/2005 which we are definitely not !
i have written to the revenue but wo n't hold my breath for an answer .
john , southend i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software dave , cambridge as a software engineer , i find the comment " they were aware of the error but they ca n't do anything to stop it " sadly comical .
i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software .
dave , cambridge this is now the third incorrect notification i have received from the revenue in three years .
on questioning them , i received a letter saying that on further investigation my records were up to date .
no apology for the waste of time and effort made to try and contact them and send them proof of my payments .
this completely undermines my trust in the system .
no wonder the pensions industry is in such a mess .
julia arnott , amptill , beds the bbc is a bit slow here : lots of us at work got our letters back in october !
fortunately the hmrc helpline was well-prepared -lrb- open until 8pm too -rrb- .
it told us it was a computer glitch and suggested that we ring back in 12 weeks if we had n't been sent a letter saying that they had made a mistake .
sue , bath , somerset computer blunders are very rare , it is usually the people that programme them that cause the problems .
simon mcwade , stockport our tax system is way too complicated peter judson , ibstock this is just crazy especially given the fact that the numbers of years required for a full pension based of ni contributions is likely to reduce from 44 for men and 39 for women to 30 years for all .
thus making perhaps all of the 4.7 million letters completely irrelevant !
our tax system is way too complicated , combined with a chancellor making it up as he goes along .
no it system could cope .
peter judson , ibstock it 's a good job hm revenue & customs do n't run parties at breweries !
neil , stockport another government it disaster !
will anyone be held responsible and removed -lrb- downwards or out -rrb- from their post ?
not a chance !
early retirement on a good pension or even promotion is more likely from this government that does so much to reward incompetence !
mark pearson , bicester , oxon the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

the bbc discovered the blunder after a number of people contacted money box to say they had been sent letters in error .
hmrc has confirmed its error but can not say how many people are affected .
the institute of payroll professionals estimates it to be 700,000 .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
i received one of these letters and i wrote sending in a copy of my p60 .
because they do not recognise that i have paid my full national insurance , they have failed to forward the ni contributions on to my stakeholder pension company in respect of my opting-out of the government 's second pension .
i am therefore losing investment growth , and have asked them for a date when this money -lrb- approx £ 1,500 -rrb- will be sent and how much compensation they will pay .
richard proudfoot , norwich i sent for a pension forecast 18 months ago .
i was told there was a shortfall in contributions .
i telephoned , i forwarded the relevant p60s .
i have requested two more forecasts in the past year and it still has n't been corrected .
patricia , burnley in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts chris , swindon i 'm stunned that this huge ni error for year 2004/2005 is still unresolved as it was known to exist at least since march 2006 as i received a state pension forecast that included this error of £ 371.80 .
when i queried it in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts due to errors from the revenue systems .
yet nine months on they are still making it worse !
chris , swindon i have n't made ni contributions since 1995 .
ironically , i have n't received a letter stating there is a shortfall for year 2004/5 , which makes this situation even more strange .
marion , bristol i received such a letter which was dated a month earlier than the postmark .
i am fully paid up for that year and no , i 'm not sending an original p60 for them to lose or wasting any time filling out forms .
what about other years ?
am i going to reach pension age to be told " sorry love , the latest piece of technology has n't heard of you " .
kay adamson , chester i received one of these letters and just saw red .
i was very angry and especially as i work in the royal household .
do you think my boss would not pay over ni contributions ?
how did these letters get out ?
do we now employ brainless wonders in the civil service ?
surely somebody checks what a computer system is producing ?
anyway , i phoned the helpline and was rather rude .
i have now sent the letter to my mp saying that i want the matter sorted out .
ted shepherd , windsor i do n't suppose they 'll pay any compensation , yet if we 're late with filing , we face a substantial fine .
as much of hmrc 's work is handled by overpaid consultancies , they should forfeit a substantial portion of their fees for each and every blunder !
neil , devizes , uk i work for local government and received my letter a couple of months ago .
i phoned the helpline and was told that due to staff shortages , 04/05 contributions had n't yet been input , so the computer saw the shortfall and sent out the letter .
they said this affected a couple of hundred thousand people and to ignore the letter !
andy , warwick my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries robert , coventry my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries .
the consultants who designed the it systems sold them to successive governments .
the chancellor has said he will put an end to " consultancy culture " .
it would be nice if that were to include a review of the major it consultancy and outsourcing failures up to date - but do n't hold your breath .
too many skeletons in too many cupboards for the real culprits ever to be brought to book , i fear .
robert , coventry i got the impression that the erroneous letters are related to people on payroll .
i am a full-time mother , currently in receipt of child benefit and therefore home responsibilities protection .
i have received a letter suggesting a voluntary top-up payment of £ 350 , which does n't make sense to me , as i thought the whole point of hrp was to protect against the inability to make any ni contributions whilst caring for children and out of the paid workforce .
this is the first time i have received such a letter whilst in receipt of hrp .
penny carter , guildford i also received one of these letters .
i was so shocked as i have been in continuous employment throughout those years and knew my contributions were up-to-date .
but as a trusting person , as most people are , it did n't enter my head that the revenue could be wrong .
so i was saving to pay this money to them , but thanks to your programme i do not need to worry now .
june arnold , builth wells powys it is not just people in work who have a problem with 04/05 national insurance records , people who have recently retired are getting less pension then they should because they have no contributions recorded for that year. in some cases it has caused a system fault with additional pension payments and people are thousands of pounds down .
john , swansea when the revenue had previous it problems the press always hammered the us owned company eds -lrb- the previous it contractors -rrb- for the problems .
since the contract is now in the hands of the french owned cap gemini , they are never mentioned when any it problems occur .
why the unfair press ?
living in the town and being an employee of one of the companies where these errors are created , i do have quite some insight into these problems .
laurence , telford to our company 's credit -lrb- edf energy -rrb- they did contact nearly every employee via our payroll and have told us to contact them if we receive a letter from the revenue .
but what will the incompetent revenue do about it and how many other " little errors " have gone unnoticed ?
paul clarkson errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally matthew , geneva i work for the foreign and commonwealth office and received one of these letters this week despite my contributions being up to date .
i called the helpline , was put straight through to an assistant and the problem was explained to me clearly and resolved in a matter of minutes .
errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally and not by an automated system .
matthew , geneva my flatmate received one of these and was truly puzzled .
once again a major failure to correctly implement a government it solution .
why are these contractors paid ?
if they make a mistake they should be harshly punished , and if they make a perfect system they should be given bonuses .
ben , london not only did i get the pension letter , i also was prevented by this error from getting jobseekers ' allowance .
when i eventually discovered why , i went with my p60 to prove i had paid the ni .
the job centre staff knew all about the problem and i am still awaiting the allowance five months later .
peter , wokingham i work for ge capital , one of the largest companies in the world and i too have received one of these letters .
i think it is scandalous that the bbc / moneybox has to bring this to our attention .
the revenue should have immediately sent out a letter informing us of this problem .
anon the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing bob bowen , weston super mare the revenue admitted to me there was a problem with 2004/5 back in may .

june arnold , builth wells powys it is not just people in work who have a problem with 04/05 national insurance records , people who have recently retired are getting less pension then they should because they have no contributions recorded for that year. in some cases it has caused a system fault with additional pension payments and people are thousands of pounds down .
john , swansea when the revenue had previous it problems the press always hammered the us owned company eds -lrb- the previous it contractors -rrb- for the problems .
since the contract is now in the hands of the french owned cap gemini , they are never mentioned when any it problems occur .
why the unfair press ?
living in the town and being an employee of one of the companies where these errors are created , i do have quite some insight into these problems .
laurence , telford to our company 's credit -lrb- edf energy -rrb- they did contact nearly every employee via our payroll and have told us to contact them if we receive a letter from the revenue .
but what will the incompetent revenue do about it and how many other " little errors " have gone unnoticed ?
paul clarkson errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally matthew , geneva i work for the foreign and commonwealth office and received one of these letters this week despite my contributions being up to date .
i called the helpline , was put straight through to an assistant and the problem was explained to me clearly and resolved in a matter of minutes .
errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally and not by an automated system .
matthew , geneva my flatmate received one of these and was truly puzzled .
once again a major failure to correctly implement a government it solution .
why are these contractors paid ?
if they make a mistake they should be harshly punished , and if they make a perfect system they should be given bonuses .
ben , london not only did i get the pension letter , i also was prevented by this error from getting jobseekers ' allowance .
when i eventually discovered why , i went with my p60 to prove i had paid the ni .
the job centre staff knew all about the problem and i am still awaiting the allowance five months later .
peter , wokingham i work for ge capital , one of the largest companies in the world and i too have received one of these letters .
i think it is scandalous that the bbc / moneybox has to bring this to our attention .
the revenue should have immediately sent out a letter informing us of this problem .
anon the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing bob bowen , weston super mare the revenue admitted to me there was a problem with 2004/5 back in may .
my son , who used to work for me , was denied invalidity allowance because the office he was dealing with said he had no contributions for the year in question .
i had paid all his contributions as i was his employer at the time .
when questioned the revenue said that payments were received and the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing .
he appealed but had all benefits withdrawn because of the gap .
bob bowen , weston super mare another it disaster from a badly designed and badly funded it system .
this at the same time hmrc announce plans to make staff cuts because they say they now have efficient staff-saving computer systems .
karl , chester this bodes well for id cards and the nhs it system does n't it ?
chandra , london i have received one such letter , and i was confident that it was a mistake , as i keep all my records for at least three years .
s jondhale , birmingham government it projects are initiated by ministers and senior managers in the civil service .
seasoned in-house it professionals are not usually involved in the planning stage .
we only get involved at implementation , when changes raise costs significantly and lengthen schedules .
we are then often overruled as the short-term ramifications are politically unacceptable .
no-one really cares about the long term , our current system simply does n't reward long-term thinking .
jay , aylmerton how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse ?
richard , milton keynes maybe if the mammoth hm revenue and customs was split into more focussed businesses it would be able to do its job properly .
how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse when the business is all over the place .
richard , milton keynes what about those on benefits ?
my wife is on incapacity benefit and she 's received one of these letters .
alan horn , berkhamsted just one word missing : " sorry " .
not surprising , though .
what incompetence !
what arrogance !
reginald , birmingham income tax £ 4,000 , national insurance £ 1,800 , revenue and customs worthless .
too much bureaucracy , rules no one -lrb- including themselves -rrb- can comprehend , and an attitude of " we do n't make mistakes " .
it 's time the entire incompetent lot was scrapped and replaced by people with brains in their heads .
let 's not forget the repeated tax credits fiascos in addition to this latest example from this hopelessly inept agency .
jim -lrb- born free , taxed to death -rrb- , greater manchester my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out adrian richards , nottingham i received one of these letters last september , and i am not in one the groups mentioned .
when i rang , i was told everyone 's record for the same part of that tax year was missing due to a problem with moving records between different computer systems , and they knew there was a big problem .
they said that it would get sorted out over time , but until it was , more letters would be sent out .
because i phoned , my record was corrected within a few days .
since then , my wife has also received a similar letter .
my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out .
but it does make you question everything that the government and its departments are doing .
adrian richards , nottingham this error has been discovered in a timely manner .
how can we be sure when we eventually come to draw our pension that the final calculation will be based on accurate records dating back some 44 to 49 years ?
unless people have kept every p60 between school and retirement , the revenue 's computer 's decision will be final .
kevin geary , radstock i had a similar notice last year relating to payments in 1998 .
it said i had n't paid the stamps for eight months although 1998 was the same throughout .
if i paid the difference i would get full pension .
i then spent considerable time and trouble telling them they were wrong , with which conclusion they agreed .
i still have n't had the difference or even an acknowledgement of the difference .
d smith , dorchester the trouble is that the tax system is simply too complex to be computerised !
maybe they should try simplifying it before using a computer ?
the error is not the computers , by the way , but the overload caused by failing to appreciate how much the system would be overloaded !
most government bodies are optimists !
roger , oxford staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with andy , sussex i work for hmrc .
i can confidently state this is not a case of human error .
hmrc and the nhs run two of the largest databases in the world .
staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with , so problems will occur occasionally .
people should also realise that the money given by the government to run hmrc decreases each year , reductions in staff are expected too .
this has been the case for years , and will continue .
there is only so far you can squeeze before the juice starts leaking !
andy , sussex i received one such letter - i 'm a 21 year old student who has n't actually started making pension contributions .
i should imagine that i need to give considerably more than £ 371 .
alice , london always include a copy of the relevant , recent letter which the revenue sent you in any query .
i find it helps !
chris gore , richmond i was made aware of a 2004/05 contribution shortfall when i requested a pension forecast from the pension service in january .
the irony is i work for hmrc !
i wrote to the national insurance contributions office , enclosing a copy of my p60 and it was put right .
their comment ?
" there is a delay in processing your employer 's scheme . "
lesley the phrase " computer error " is nonsense .
it is always used in a pathetic attempt to evade responsibility for a human error .
bob pearson , bourne both my wife , a teacher , and i , a self employed it consultant , who files end of year returns online , have been told we have to pay £ 370 because we are short on ni contributions for 2004/2005 which we are definitely not !
i have written to the revenue but wo n't hold my breath for an answer .
john , southend i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software dave , cambridge as a software engineer , i find the comment " they were aware of the error but they ca n't do anything to stop it " sadly comical .
i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software .
dave , cambridge this is now the third incorrect notification i have received from the revenue in three years .
on questioning them , i received a letter saying that on further investigation my records were up to date .
no apology for the waste of time and effort made to try and contact them and send them proof of my payments .
this completely undermines my trust in the system .
no wonder the pensions industry is in such a mess .
julia arnott , amptill , beds the bbc is a bit slow here : lots of us at work got our letters back in october !
fortunately the hmrc helpline was well-prepared -lrb- open until 8pm too -rrb- .
it told us it was a computer glitch and suggested that we ring back in 12 weeks if we had n't been sent a letter saying that they had made a mistake .
sue , bath , somerset computer blunders are very rare , it is usually the people that programme them that cause the problems .
simon mcwade , stockport our tax system is way too complicated peter judson , ibstock this is just crazy especially given the fact that the numbers of years required for a full pension based of ni contributions is likely to reduce from 44 for men and 39 for women to 30 years for all .
thus making perhaps all of the 4.7 million letters completely irrelevant !
our tax system is way too complicated , combined with a chancellor making it up as he goes along .
no it system could cope .
peter judson , ibstock it 's a good job hm revenue & customs do n't run parties at breweries !
neil , stockport another government it disaster !
will anyone be held responsible and removed -lrb- downwards or out -rrb- from their post ?
not a chance !
early retirement on a good pension or even promotion is more likely from this government that does so much to reward incompetence !
mark pearson , bicester , oxon the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .

the bbc discovered the blunder after a number of people contacted money box to say they had been sent letters in error .
hmrc has confirmed its error but can not say how many people are affected .
the institute of payroll professionals estimates it to be 700,000 .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
i received one of these letters and i wrote sending in a copy of my p60 .
because they do not recognise that i have paid my full national insurance , they have failed to forward the ni contributions on to my stakeholder pension company in respect of my opting-out of the government 's second pension .
i am therefore losing investment growth , and have asked them for a date when this money -lrb- approx £ 1,500 -rrb- will be sent and how much compensation they will pay .
richard proudfoot , norwich i sent for a pension forecast 18 months ago .
i was told there was a shortfall in contributions .
i telephoned , i forwarded the relevant p60s .
i have requested two more forecasts in the past year and it still has n't been corrected .
patricia , burnley in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts chris , swindon i 'm stunned that this huge ni error for year 2004/2005 is still unresolved as it was known to exist at least since march 2006 as i received a state pension forecast that included this error of £ 371.80 .
when i queried it in march they said they already knew this error was present on thousands of forecasts due to errors from the revenue systems .
yet nine months on they are still making it worse !
chris , swindon i have n't made ni contributions since 1995 .
ironically , i have n't received a letter stating there is a shortfall for year 2004/5 , which makes this situation even more strange .
marion , bristol i received such a letter which was dated a month earlier than the postmark .
i am fully paid up for that year and no , i 'm not sending an original p60 for them to lose or wasting any time filling out forms .
what about other years ?
am i going to reach pension age to be told " sorry love , the latest piece of technology has n't heard of you " .
kay adamson , chester i received one of these letters and just saw red .
i was very angry and especially as i work in the royal household .
do you think my boss would not pay over ni contributions ?
how did these letters get out ?
do we now employ brainless wonders in the civil service ?
surely somebody checks what a computer system is producing ?
anyway , i phoned the helpline and was rather rude .
i have now sent the letter to my mp saying that i want the matter sorted out .
ted shepherd , windsor i do n't suppose they 'll pay any compensation , yet if we 're late with filing , we face a substantial fine .
as much of hmrc 's work is handled by overpaid consultancies , they should forfeit a substantial portion of their fees for each and every blunder !
neil , devizes , uk i work for local government and received my letter a couple of months ago .
i phoned the helpline and was told that due to staff shortages , 04/05 contributions had n't yet been input , so the computer saw the shortfall and sent out the letter .
they said this affected a couple of hundred thousand people and to ignore the letter !
andy , warwick my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries robert , coventry my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries .
the consultants who designed the it systems sold them to successive governments .
the chancellor has said he will put an end to " consultancy culture " .
it would be nice if that were to include a review of the major it consultancy and outsourcing failures up to date - but do n't hold your breath .
too many skeletons in too many cupboards for the real culprits ever to be brought to book , i fear .
robert , coventry i got the impression that the erroneous letters are related to people on payroll .
i am a full-time mother , currently in receipt of child benefit and therefore home responsibilities protection .
i have received a letter suggesting a voluntary top-up payment of £ 350 , which does n't make sense to me , as i thought the whole point of hrp was to protect against the inability to make any ni contributions whilst caring for children and out of the paid workforce .
this is the first time i have received such a letter whilst in receipt of hrp .
penny carter , guildford i also received one of these letters .
i was so shocked as i have been in continuous employment throughout those years and knew my contributions were up-to-date .
but as a trusting person , as most people are , it did n't enter my head that the revenue could be wrong .
so i was saving to pay this money to them , but thanks to your programme i do not need to worry now .

i have now sent the letter to my mp saying that i want the matter sorted out .
ted shepherd , windsor i do n't suppose they 'll pay any compensation , yet if we 're late with filing , we face a substantial fine .
as much of hmrc 's work is handled by overpaid consultancies , they should forfeit a substantial portion of their fees for each and every blunder !
neil , devizes , uk i work for local government and received my letter a couple of months ago .
i phoned the helpline and was told that due to staff shortages , 04/05 contributions had n't yet been input , so the computer saw the shortfall and sent out the letter .
they said this affected a couple of hundred thousand people and to ignore the letter !
andy , warwick my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries robert , coventry my colleagues at hmrc are perfectly capable of organising events at breweries .
the consultants who designed the it systems sold them to successive governments .
the chancellor has said he will put an end to " consultancy culture " .
it would be nice if that were to include a review of the major it consultancy and outsourcing failures up to date - but do n't hold your breath .
too many skeletons in too many cupboards for the real culprits ever to be brought to book , i fear .
robert , coventry i got the impression that the erroneous letters are related to people on payroll .
i am a full-time mother , currently in receipt of child benefit and therefore home responsibilities protection .
i have received a letter suggesting a voluntary top-up payment of £ 350 , which does n't make sense to me , as i thought the whole point of hrp was to protect against the inability to make any ni contributions whilst caring for children and out of the paid workforce .
this is the first time i have received such a letter whilst in receipt of hrp .
penny carter , guildford i also received one of these letters .
i was so shocked as i have been in continuous employment throughout those years and knew my contributions were up-to-date .
but as a trusting person , as most people are , it did n't enter my head that the revenue could be wrong .
so i was saving to pay this money to them , but thanks to your programme i do not need to worry now .
june arnold , builth wells powys it is not just people in work who have a problem with 04/05 national insurance records , people who have recently retired are getting less pension then they should because they have no contributions recorded for that year. in some cases it has caused a system fault with additional pension payments and people are thousands of pounds down .
john , swansea when the revenue had previous it problems the press always hammered the us owned company eds -lrb- the previous it contractors -rrb- for the problems .
since the contract is now in the hands of the french owned cap gemini , they are never mentioned when any it problems occur .
why the unfair press ?
living in the town and being an employee of one of the companies where these errors are created , i do have quite some insight into these problems .
laurence , telford to our company 's credit -lrb- edf energy -rrb- they did contact nearly every employee via our payroll and have told us to contact them if we receive a letter from the revenue .
but what will the incompetent revenue do about it and how many other " little errors " have gone unnoticed ?
paul clarkson errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally matthew , geneva i work for the foreign and commonwealth office and received one of these letters this week despite my contributions being up to date .
i called the helpline , was put straight through to an assistant and the problem was explained to me clearly and resolved in a matter of minutes .
errors do occur but at least enquiries are being handled professionally and not by an automated system .
matthew , geneva my flatmate received one of these and was truly puzzled .
once again a major failure to correctly implement a government it solution .
why are these contractors paid ?
if they make a mistake they should be harshly punished , and if they make a perfect system they should be given bonuses .
ben , london not only did i get the pension letter , i also was prevented by this error from getting jobseekers ' allowance .
when i eventually discovered why , i went with my p60 to prove i had paid the ni .
the job centre staff knew all about the problem and i am still awaiting the allowance five months later .
peter , wokingham i work for ge capital , one of the largest companies in the world and i too have received one of these letters .
i think it is scandalous that the bbc / moneybox has to bring this to our attention .
the revenue should have immediately sent out a letter informing us of this problem .
anon the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing bob bowen , weston super mare the revenue admitted to me there was a problem with 2004/5 back in may .
my son , who used to work for me , was denied invalidity allowance because the office he was dealing with said he had no contributions for the year in question .
i had paid all his contributions as i was his employer at the time .
when questioned the revenue said that payments were received and the contributions agency told me there was a major backlog because of new computer systems failing .
he appealed but had all benefits withdrawn because of the gap .
bob bowen , weston super mare another it disaster from a badly designed and badly funded it system .
this at the same time hmrc announce plans to make staff cuts because they say they now have efficient staff-saving computer systems .
karl , chester this bodes well for id cards and the nhs it system does n't it ?
chandra , london i have received one such letter , and i was confident that it was a mistake , as i keep all my records for at least three years .
s jondhale , birmingham government it projects are initiated by ministers and senior managers in the civil service .
seasoned in-house it professionals are not usually involved in the planning stage .
we only get involved at implementation , when changes raise costs significantly and lengthen schedules .
we are then often overruled as the short-term ramifications are politically unacceptable .
no-one really cares about the long term , our current system simply does n't reward long-term thinking .
jay , aylmerton how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse ?
richard , milton keynes maybe if the mammoth hm revenue and customs was split into more focussed businesses it would be able to do its job properly .
how can one director at the top be able to keep their finger on the pulse when the business is all over the place .
richard , milton keynes what about those on benefits ?
my wife is on incapacity benefit and she 's received one of these letters .
alan horn , berkhamsted just one word missing : " sorry " .
not surprising , though .
what incompetence !
what arrogance !
reginald , birmingham income tax £ 4,000 , national insurance £ 1,800 , revenue and customs worthless .
too much bureaucracy , rules no one -lrb- including themselves -rrb- can comprehend , and an attitude of " we do n't make mistakes " .
it 's time the entire incompetent lot was scrapped and replaced by people with brains in their heads .
let 's not forget the repeated tax credits fiascos in addition to this latest example from this hopelessly inept agency .
jim -lrb- born free , taxed to death -rrb- , greater manchester my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out adrian richards , nottingham i received one of these letters last september , and i am not in one the groups mentioned .
when i rang , i was told everyone 's record for the same part of that tax year was missing due to a problem with moving records between different computer systems , and they knew there was a big problem .
they said that it would get sorted out over time , but until it was , more letters would be sent out .
because i phoned , my record was corrected within a few days .
since then , my wife has also received a similar letter .
my advice , forget the letter , it will sort itself out .
but it does make you question everything that the government and its departments are doing .
adrian richards , nottingham this error has been discovered in a timely manner .
how can we be sure when we eventually come to draw our pension that the final calculation will be based on accurate records dating back some 44 to 49 years ?
unless people have kept every p60 between school and retirement , the revenue 's computer 's decision will be final .
kevin geary , radstock i had a similar notice last year relating to payments in 1998 .
it said i had n't paid the stamps for eight months although 1998 was the same throughout .
if i paid the difference i would get full pension .
i then spent considerable time and trouble telling them they were wrong , with which conclusion they agreed .
i still have n't had the difference or even an acknowledgement of the difference .
d smith , dorchester the trouble is that the tax system is simply too complex to be computerised !
maybe they should try simplifying it before using a computer ?
the error is not the computers , by the way , but the overload caused by failing to appreciate how much the system would be overloaded !
most government bodies are optimists !
roger , oxford staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with andy , sussex i work for hmrc .
i can confidently state this is not a case of human error .
hmrc and the nhs run two of the largest databases in the world .
staff really do try their best given the conditions and systems they have to work with , so problems will occur occasionally .
people should also realise that the money given by the government to run hmrc decreases each year , reductions in staff are expected too .
this has been the case for years , and will continue .
there is only so far you can squeeze before the juice starts leaking !
andy , sussex i received one such letter - i 'm a 21 year old student who has n't actually started making pension contributions .
i should imagine that i need to give considerably more than £ 371 .
alice , london always include a copy of the relevant , recent letter which the revenue sent you in any query .
i find it helps !
chris gore , richmond i was made aware of a 2004/05 contribution shortfall when i requested a pension forecast from the pension service in january .
the irony is i work for hmrc !
i wrote to the national insurance contributions office , enclosing a copy of my p60 and it was put right .
their comment ?
" there is a delay in processing your employer 's scheme . "
lesley the phrase " computer error " is nonsense .
it is always used in a pathetic attempt to evade responsibility for a human error .
bob pearson , bourne both my wife , a teacher , and i , a self employed it consultant , who files end of year returns online , have been told we have to pay £ 370 because we are short on ni contributions for 2004/2005 which we are definitely not !
i have written to the revenue but wo n't hold my breath for an answer .
john , southend i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software dave , cambridge as a software engineer , i find the comment " they were aware of the error but they ca n't do anything to stop it " sadly comical .
i wonder which massive consultancy got huge dollops of cash to develop this software .
dave , cambridge this is now the third incorrect notification i have received from the revenue in three years .
on questioning them , i received a letter saying that on further investigation my records were up to date .
no apology for the waste of time and effort made to try and contact them and send them proof of my payments .
this completely undermines my trust in the system .
no wonder the pensions industry is in such a mess .
julia arnott , amptill , beds the bbc is a bit slow here : lots of us at work got our letters back in october !
fortunately the hmrc helpline was well-prepared -lrb- open until 8pm too -rrb- .
it told us it was a computer glitch and suggested that we ring back in 12 weeks if we had n't been sent a letter saying that they had made a mistake .
sue , bath , somerset computer blunders are very rare , it is usually the people that programme them that cause the problems .
simon mcwade , stockport our tax system is way too complicated peter judson , ibstock this is just crazy especially given the fact that the numbers of years required for a full pension based of ni contributions is likely to reduce from 44 for men and 39 for women to 30 years for all .
thus making perhaps all of the 4.7 million letters completely irrelevant !
our tax system is way too complicated , combined with a chancellor making it up as he goes along .
no it system could cope .
peter judson , ibstock it 's a good job hm revenue & customs do n't run parties at breweries !
neil , stockport another government it disaster !
will anyone be held responsible and removed -lrb- downwards or out -rrb- from their post ?
not a chance !
early retirement on a good pension or even promotion is more likely from this government that does so much to reward incompetence !
mark pearson , bicester , oxon the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

in his pre-budget report , the chancellor said air passenger duty will double from 1 february .
the extra tax is already loaded onto most fares and holidays that have been booked since 6 december .
but many people who booked earlier for travel after 1 february do not yet know if they will pay extra or if airlines and tour firms will absorb the cost .
the rise will mean for example that tax on a short-haul flight in europe moves up to £ 10 per passenger and up to £ 80 per passenger on long haul business flights .
families who have already booked next year 's package holiday should escape having to pay more according to david alexander of abta which represents travel agents and tour firms .
speaking to bbc radio 4 's money box he said that under the government 's package travel regulations " the tour operator will have to absorb 2 % of the holiday cost before it can actually surcharge anyone .
" so for example , on a £ 400 package , which is roughly the industry average , 2 % is £ 8 and mostly air passenger duty increase will be £ 5 .
so -lsb- tour -rsb- operators will not be able to pass on this increase " .
mr alexander calculates the package holiday industry will lose around £ 40m as over 4m holiday packages have already been booked when tax was at the lower rate but on which extra tax is now due .
flights only people who have bought just flight tickets face a different situation and are likely to be asked to pay extra .
most airlines are still investigating how they might make passengers pay up or even if they have the legal right to demand extra money .
we have not ruled out the idea of putting on our gordon brown costumes and collecting with a bucket toby nichol , easyjet toby nichol of easyjet says the airline faces an extra £ 4.5m tax bill if passengers are not prepared to pay up but making them do so could be difficult .
he hopes passengers will be prepared to pay an extra £ 5 to cover the tax as a goodwill gesture .
" we will be going back to our customers and saying - the chancellor has doubled air passenger duty - how do you feel about giving us an extra fiver ? " he said .
and he added : " we still have not ruled out the idea of putting on our gordon brown costumes and walking up and down the aisle on 1 february collecting with a bucket . "
so far only one airline , british airways , has said it will definitely not try to pass the increased tax onto passengers who pre-booked before the chancellor 's announcement .
the cost to the business will be £ 11m .
virgin atlantic said it was still deciding whether or how to collect the extra tax .
ryanair said it still intends to challenge the tax rise but would not give any more details about its intentions .
monarch airlines told us it has 180,000 passengers pre-booked for travel after 1 february .
it also has not yet made a decision on whether or how to collect the extra tax now owing .

in his pre-budget report , the chancellor said air passenger duty will double from 1 february .
the extra tax is already loaded onto most fares and holidays that have been booked since 6 december .
but many people who booked earlier for travel after 1 february do not yet know if they will pay extra or if airlines and tour firms will absorb the cost .
the rise will mean for example that tax on a short-haul flight in europe moves up to £ 10 per passenger and up to £ 80 per passenger on long haul business flights .
families who have already booked next year 's package holiday should escape having to pay more according to david alexander of abta which represents travel agents and tour firms .
speaking to bbc radio 4 's money box he said that under the government 's package travel regulations " the tour operator will have to absorb 2 % of the holiday cost before it can actually surcharge anyone .
" so for example , on a £ 400 package , which is roughly the industry average , 2 % is £ 8 and mostly air passenger duty increase will be £ 5 .
so -lsb- tour -rsb- operators will not be able to pass on this increase " .
mr alexander calculates the package holiday industry will lose around £ 40m as over 4m holiday packages have already been booked when tax was at the lower rate but on which extra tax is now due .
flights only people who have bought just flight tickets face a different situation and are likely to be asked to pay extra .
most airlines are still investigating how they might make passengers pay up or even if they have the legal right to demand extra money .
we have not ruled out the idea of putting on our gordon brown costumes and collecting with a bucket toby nichol , easyjet toby nichol of easyjet says the airline faces an extra £ 4.5m tax bill if passengers are not prepared to pay up but making them do so could be difficult .
he hopes passengers will be prepared to pay an extra £ 5 to cover the tax as a goodwill gesture .
" we will be going back to our customers and saying - the chancellor has doubled air passenger duty - how do you feel about giving us an extra fiver ? " he said .
and he added : " we still have not ruled out the idea of putting on our gordon brown costumes and walking up and down the aisle on 1 february collecting with a bucket . "
so far only one airline , british airways , has said it will definitely not try to pass the increased tax onto passengers who pre-booked before the chancellor 's announcement .
the cost to the business will be £ 11m .
virgin atlantic said it was still deciding whether or how to collect the extra tax .
ryanair said it still intends to challenge the tax rise but would not give any more details about its intentions .
