" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .

" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .

" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .

just as in previous years around the easter holidays , the price for premium petrol , for example , has climbed to a new annual record - this time hitting 1.36 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per liter , or 6 euros per gallon .
in the land of mercedes , bmws and no speed limits on highways , this sharp rise by more than 5 eurocents really hurts and has drivers calling for punitive action . " i think there is a lot of speculation going on in the markets now , " one driver commented , adding that it 's time the authorities stopped oil companies from driving petrol prices ever higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holiday time in germany means increased traffic on the roads many motorists , however , feel the government is part of the problem as it has been imposing more and more new taxes on fuel in recent years . taxes , drive for profits to blame in the past few years , petrol prices have indeed climbed steadily - partly as a result of a so-called ecology tax imposed on fuels and energy in germany .
but consumer advocacy groups are claiming that oil companies have used this as a pretext to raise prices excessively . they also accuse oil companies of using days of heightened traffic , such as the long easter weekend , to rake in easy profits . rolf-peter rocke of the german adac motorists ' association says this practice is especially apparent in regions with few petrol stations . " companies are cashing in especially in regions where there is little competition , " he said .
" on the island of rügen for example , people can hardly compare prices because there are only around five petrol stations .
in towns and cities , however , drivers have this option and should now really make use of their freedom to choose so that prices will eventually come down again . " us situation also a factor but heino elfert from the german energy watchdog energieinformationsdienst says oil companies are only partly to blame for the current sky-high prices . " as in previous years around this time , petrol prices have even outpaced high prices for oil because of depleted gasoline stocks in the united states , " elfert said .
" since american refineries are unable to meet the domestic demand they need to buy huge volumes of gasoline on the world market . " for german drivers , understanding the causes of their pain at the pump is just cold comfort .
increasingly , german consumers are buying cars that run on alternative fuels such as natural gas or diesel made from rapeseed . but in spite of the boom in automotive alternatives here , the next public outrage over petrol prices is just as sure to come as the next holiday season . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

" i think there is a lot of speculation going on in the markets now , " one driver commented , adding that it 's time the authorities stopped oil companies from driving petrol prices ever higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holiday time in germany means increased traffic on the roads many motorists , however , feel the government is part of the problem as it has been imposing more and more new taxes on fuel in recent years . taxes , drive for profits to blame in the past few years , petrol prices have indeed climbed steadily - partly as a result of a so-called ecology tax imposed on fuels and energy in germany .
but consumer advocacy groups are claiming that oil companies have used this as a pretext to raise prices excessively . they also accuse oil companies of using days of heightened traffic , such as the long easter weekend , to rake in easy profits . rolf-peter rocke of the german adac motorists ' association says this practice is especially apparent in regions with few petrol stations . " companies are cashing in especially in regions where there is little competition , " he said .
" on the island of rügen for example , people can hardly compare prices because there are only around five petrol stations .
in towns and cities , however , drivers have this option and should now really make use of their freedom to choose so that prices will eventually come down again . " us situation also a factor but heino elfert from the german energy watchdog energieinformationsdienst says oil companies are only partly to blame for the current sky-high prices . " as in previous years around this time , petrol prices have even outpaced high prices for oil because of depleted gasoline stocks in the united states , " elfert said .
" since american refineries are unable to meet the domestic demand they need to buy huge volumes of gasoline on the world market . " for german drivers , understanding the causes of their pain at the pump is just cold comfort .
increasingly , german consumers are buying cars that run on alternative fuels such as natural gas or diesel made from rapeseed . but in spite of the boom in automotive alternatives here , the next public outrage over petrol prices is just as sure to come as the next holiday season . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.04.2006 iran rebuffs un atomic chief , refuses to halt nuclear drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no movement seemed to come from elbaradei 's talks in tehran iran 's hard-line regime on thursday dismissed appeals from un 's atomic watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei to freeze its controversial nuclear program and calm suspicions it is seeking the bomb . speaking after talks with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , top nuclear negotiator ali larijani brushed off the un security council 's demand for a halt in uranium enrichment by the end of the month as not very important .
" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.04.2006 public frustration mounts in case of german hostages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at regular vigils in leipzig , frustration over the lack of progress is growing the continued captivity of german engineers taken hostage in iraq over two months ago is leading to a sense among some germans that the government is not doing enough to secure their release . on thursday evening at a vigil in leipzig , family members of engineers rené bräunlich and thomas nitzschke and employees of the company they work for , cryotec , expressed indirect criticism of the federal government regarding their attempts to obtain the men 's freedom . according to karin berndt , a spokesperson for cryotec , a general feeling was spreading that berlin made greater efforts to ensure the releases of susanne osthoff , an archaeologist who was taken hostage in iraq , and the family of former state secretary jürgen chrobog , which was seized in yemen shortly after christmas .
both osthoff and the chrobog family were released unharmed by their captors . " i have the impression that in those cases … other standards were applied , " said berndt at the latest of the regular vigils that are being held in the engineers ' hometown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team dealing with the kidnapping has had little success she said many people could not understand that even after 11 weeks of work by the crisis team assembled after the men were taken hostage , no progress had been made .
the osthoff and chrobog cases were resolved more quickly , she said . " the importance of those cases should n't be considered higher than the case of our co-workers , " she said , calling on the federal government " to pull out all the stops to support the work of the crisis team . " christian führer , the pastor of leipzig 's nikolaikirche , joined in the calls for more action by the government , saying it should explore all the possible options , including " asking for the help of other nations , for example arabic states .

" relax , and have a good easter , " prodi said pisanu had told him . " the situation seems calmer , because i know there 's nothing to worry about .
we need patience , but in the end , this is democracy , " he told journalists . in addition to germany , britain and brazil have joined the growing number of countries acknowledging prodi 's election victory . however , there have been no congratulatory phone calls yet from us president george w. bush - an ally of berlusconi - and pope benedict xvi . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy facing weeks of uncertainty analysts say italy will have to cope with weeks of political and economic uncertainty as prime minister berlusconi rejected a general election result .

both osthoff and the chrobog family were released unharmed by their captors . " i have the impression that in those cases … other standards were applied , " said berndt at the latest of the regular vigils that are being held in the engineers ' hometown .

the osthoff and chrobog cases were resolved more quickly , she said .

the political demands made by the hostage takers , which have changed several times over the course of time , indicate to analysts that a criminal group could be involved . bräunlich , 32 , and nitschke , 28 , were kidnapped in northern iraq on january 24 while working on several short-term contracts for the cryotec firm .
the latest video , which was dated march 28 and is 24 seconds in length , showed both men looking drawn and haggard . " we have been held captive here for more than 60 days , " pleaded nitzschke as he addressed the german government .

both osthoff and the chrobog family were released unharmed by their captors . " i have the impression that in those cases … other standards were applied , " said berndt at the latest of the regular vigils that are being held in the engineers ' hometown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team dealing with the kidnapping has had little success she said many people could not understand that even after 11 weeks of work by the crisis team assembled after the men were taken hostage , no progress had been made .
the osthoff and chrobog cases were resolved more quickly , she said . " the importance of those cases should n't be considered higher than the case of our co-workers , " she said , calling on the federal government " to pull out all the stops to support the work of the crisis team . " christian führer , the pastor of leipzig 's nikolaikirche , joined in the calls for more action by the government , saying it should explore all the possible options , including " asking for the help of other nations , for example arabic states . " ransom demands according to a report in the newsmagazine focus , the kidnappers are asking for a ransom of 9.9 million euros -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- for the men 's release .
the magazine based its report on sources close to the crisis team , which has contacts to middlemen in iraq . on friday , the foreign ministry refused to comment on the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still image from the lastest video clip of the kidnapped engineers after analysis of a new video of the hostages posted on an islamic web site on sunday , the magazine report says the crisis team is not ruling out the possibility that the hostages had been " sold " to a criminal organization in iraq .
the political demands made by the hostage takers , which have changed several times over the course of time , indicate to analysts that a criminal group could be involved . bräunlich , 32 , and nitschke , 28 , were kidnapped in northern iraq on january 24 while working on several short-term contracts for the cryotec firm .
the latest video , which was dated march 28 and is 24 seconds in length , showed both men looking drawn and haggard . " we have been held captive here for more than 60 days , " pleaded nitzschke as he addressed the german government .
" we are close to breaking point .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said it had made fuel with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with long-running stand-off looking set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . the united states has been prodding the security council to take a tough stand against the islamic republic , including possible sanctions , but it has run into opposition from veto-wielding members russia and china . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said consultations on how to tackle the regime were ongoing , but sidestepped the question of what action could be taken .
" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has declared iran a nuclear power ahmadinejad also said iran was working on advanced p2 centrifuges - highly efficient devices that can enrich far more effectively than the p1 technology currently in use in iran . " our centrifuges are the p1 type , and the next step is the p2 , which has a capacity four times greater and on which we are presently conducting research , " the president was quoted as saying by irna . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

both osthoff and the chrobog family were released unharmed by their captors . " i have the impression that in those cases … other standards were applied , " said berndt at the latest of the regular vigils that are being held in the engineers ' hometown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team dealing with the kidnapping has had little success she said many people could not understand that even after 11 weeks of work by the crisis team assembled after the men were taken hostage , no progress had been made .
the osthoff and chrobog cases were resolved more quickly , she said . " the importance of those cases should n't be considered higher than the case of our co-workers , " she said , calling on the federal government " to pull out all the stops to support the work of the crisis team .

the magazine based its report on sources close to the crisis team , which has contacts to middlemen in iraq . on friday , the foreign ministry refused to comment on the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still image from the lastest video clip of the kidnapped engineers after analysis of a new video of the hostages posted on an islamic web site on sunday , the magazine report says the crisis team is not ruling out the possibility that the hostages had been " sold " to a criminal organization in iraq .
the political demands made by the hostage takers , which have changed several times over the course of time , indicate to analysts that a criminal group could be involved . bräunlich , 32 , and nitschke , 28 , were kidnapped in northern iraq on january 24 while working on several short-term contracts for the cryotec firm .
the latest video , which was dated march 28 and is 24 seconds in length , showed both men looking drawn and haggard . " we have been held captive here for more than 60 days , " pleaded nitzschke as he addressed the german government .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said it had made fuel with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with long-running stand-off looking set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . the united states has been prodding the security council to take a tough stand against the islamic republic , including possible sanctions , but it has run into opposition from veto-wielding members russia and china . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said consultations on how to tackle the regime were ongoing , but sidestepped the question of what action could be taken .
" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has declared iran a nuclear power ahmadinejad also said iran was working on advanced p2 centrifuges - highly efficient devices that can enrich far more effectively than the p1 technology currently in use in iran .

iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has declared iran a nuclear power ahmadinejad also said iran was working on advanced p2 centrifuges - highly efficient devices that can enrich far more effectively than the p1 technology currently in use in iran . " our centrifuges are the p1 type , and the next step is the p2 , which has a capacity four times greater and on which we are presently conducting research , " the president was quoted as saying by irna . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

just as in previous years around the easter holidays , the price for premium petrol , for example , has climbed to a new annual record - this time hitting 1.36 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per liter , or 6 euros per gallon .
in the land of mercedes , bmws and no speed limits on highways , this sharp rise by more than 5 eurocents really hurts and has drivers calling for punitive action . " i think there is a lot of speculation going on in the markets now , " one driver commented , adding that it 's time the authorities stopped oil companies from driving petrol prices ever higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holiday time in germany means increased traffic on the roads many motorists , however , feel the government is part of the problem as it has been imposing more and more new taxes on fuel in recent years . taxes , drive for profits to blame in the past few years , petrol prices have indeed climbed steadily - partly as a result of a so-called ecology tax imposed on fuels and energy in germany .
but consumer advocacy groups are claiming that oil companies have used this as a pretext to raise prices excessively . they also accuse oil companies of using days of heightened traffic , such as the long easter weekend , to rake in easy profits . rolf-peter rocke of the german adac motorists ' association says this practice is especially apparent in regions with few petrol stations . " companies are cashing in especially in regions where there is little competition , " he said .
" on the island of rügen for example , people can hardly compare prices because there are only around five petrol stations .
in towns and cities , however , drivers have this option and should now really make use of their freedom to choose so that prices will eventually come down again . " us situation also a factor but heino elfert from the german energy watchdog energieinformationsdienst says oil companies are only partly to blame for the current sky-high prices . " as in previous years around this time , petrol prices have even outpaced high prices for oil because of depleted gasoline stocks in the united states , " elfert said .

" prodi pressing ahead prodi pressed ahead with talks with his coalition partners on forming a government , and sought to give an impression of a smooth transition to power . he said that after berlusconi 's latest fraud allegations he had made a late-night phone call to interior minister giuseppe pisanu , whose ministry was responsible for overseeing the vote . " relax , and have a good easter , " prodi said pisanu had told him . " the situation seems calmer , because i know there 's nothing to worry about .
we need patience , but in the end , this is democracy , " he told journalists . in addition to germany , britain and brazil have joined the growing number of countries acknowledging prodi 's election victory . however , there have been no congratulatory phone calls yet from us president george w. bush - an ally of berlusconi - and pope benedict xvi . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy facing weeks of uncertainty analysts say italy will have to cope with weeks of political and economic uncertainty as prime minister berlusconi rejected a general election result .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .

" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .

" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .

" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said it had made fuel with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with long-running stand-off looking set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . the united states has been prodding the security council to take a tough stand against the islamic republic , including possible sanctions , but it has run into opposition from veto-wielding members russia and china . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said consultations on how to tackle the regime were ongoing , but sidestepped the question of what action could be taken .
" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .

just as in previous years around the easter holidays , the price for premium petrol , for example , has climbed to a new annual record - this time hitting 1.36 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per liter , or 6 euros per gallon .
in the land of mercedes , bmws and no speed limits on highways , this sharp rise by more than 5 eurocents really hurts and has drivers calling for punitive action . " i think there is a lot of speculation going on in the markets now , " one driver commented , adding that it 's time the authorities stopped oil companies from driving petrol prices ever higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holiday time in germany means increased traffic on the roads many motorists , however , feel the government is part of the problem as it has been imposing more and more new taxes on fuel in recent years . taxes , drive for profits to blame in the past few years , petrol prices have indeed climbed steadily - partly as a result of a so-called ecology tax imposed on fuels and energy in germany .
but consumer advocacy groups are claiming that oil companies have used this as a pretext to raise prices excessively . they also accuse oil companies of using days of heightened traffic , such as the long easter weekend , to rake in easy profits . rolf-peter rocke of the german adac motorists ' association says this practice is especially apparent in regions with few petrol stations . " companies are cashing in especially in regions where there is little competition , " he said .
" on the island of rügen for example , people can hardly compare prices because there are only around five petrol stations .
in towns and cities , however , drivers have this option and should now really make use of their freedom to choose so that prices will eventually come down again . " us situation also a factor but heino elfert from the german energy watchdog energieinformationsdienst says oil companies are only partly to blame for the current sky-high prices . " as in previous years around this time , petrol prices have even outpaced high prices for oil because of depleted gasoline stocks in the united states , " elfert said .
" since american refineries are unable to meet the domestic demand they need to buy huge volumes of gasoline on the world market . " for german drivers , understanding the causes of their pain at the pump is just cold comfort .
increasingly , german consumers are buying cars that run on alternative fuels such as natural gas or diesel made from rapeseed . but in spite of the boom in automotive alternatives here , the next public outrage over petrol prices is just as sure to come as the next holiday season . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

just as in previous years around the easter holidays , the price for premium petrol , for example , has climbed to a new annual record - this time hitting 1.36 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per liter , or 6 euros per gallon .
in the land of mercedes , bmws and no speed limits on highways , this sharp rise by more than 5 eurocents really hurts and has drivers calling for punitive action . " i think there is a lot of speculation going on in the markets now , " one driver commented , adding that it 's time the authorities stopped oil companies from driving petrol prices ever higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holiday time in germany means increased traffic on the roads many motorists , however , feel the government is part of the problem as it has been imposing more and more new taxes on fuel in recent years . taxes , drive for profits to blame in the past few years , petrol prices have indeed climbed steadily - partly as a result of a so-called ecology tax imposed on fuels and energy in germany .
but consumer advocacy groups are claiming that oil companies have used this as a pretext to raise prices excessively . they also accuse oil companies of using days of heightened traffic , such as the long easter weekend , to rake in easy profits . rolf-peter rocke of the german adac motorists ' association says this practice is especially apparent in regions with few petrol stations . " companies are cashing in especially in regions where there is little competition , " he said .
" on the island of rügen for example , people can hardly compare prices because there are only around five petrol stations .
in towns and cities , however , drivers have this option and should now really make use of their freedom to choose so that prices will eventually come down again . " us situation also a factor but heino elfert from the german energy watchdog energieinformationsdienst says oil companies are only partly to blame for the current sky-high prices . " as in previous years around this time , petrol prices have even outpaced high prices for oil because of depleted gasoline stocks in the united states , " elfert said .
" since american refineries are unable to meet the domestic demand they need to buy huge volumes of gasoline on the world market . " for german drivers , understanding the causes of their pain at the pump is just cold comfort .
increasingly , german consumers are buying cars that run on alternative fuels such as natural gas or diesel made from rapeseed . but in spite of the boom in automotive alternatives here , the next public outrage over petrol prices is just as sure to come as the next holiday season . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

just as in previous years around the easter holidays , the price for premium petrol , for example , has climbed to a new annual record - this time hitting 1.36 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per liter , or 6 euros per gallon .

both osthoff and the chrobog family were released unharmed by their captors . " i have the impression that in those cases … other standards were applied , " said berndt at the latest of the regular vigils that are being held in the engineers ' hometown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team dealing with the kidnapping has had little success she said many people could not understand that even after 11 weeks of work by the crisis team assembled after the men were taken hostage , no progress had been made .
the osthoff and chrobog cases were resolved more quickly , she said . " the importance of those cases should n't be considered higher than the case of our co-workers , " she said , calling on the federal government " to pull out all the stops to support the work of the crisis team . " christian führer , the pastor of leipzig 's nikolaikirche , joined in the calls for more action by the government , saying it should explore all the possible options , including " asking for the help of other nations , for example arabic states . " ransom demands according to a report in the newsmagazine focus , the kidnappers are asking for a ransom of 9.9 million euros -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- for the men 's release .
the magazine based its report on sources close to the crisis team , which has contacts to middlemen in iraq . on friday , the foreign ministry refused to comment on the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still image from the lastest video clip of the kidnapped engineers after analysis of a new video of the hostages posted on an islamic web site on sunday , the magazine report says the crisis team is not ruling out the possibility that the hostages had been " sold " to a criminal organization in iraq .
the political demands made by the hostage takers , which have changed several times over the course of time , indicate to analysts that a criminal group could be involved . bräunlich , 32 , and nitschke , 28 , were kidnapped in northern iraq on january 24 while working on several short-term contracts for the cryotec firm .
the latest video , which was dated march 28 and is 24 seconds in length , showed both men looking drawn and haggard . " we have been held captive here for more than 60 days , " pleaded nitzschke as he addressed the german government .

just as in previous years around the easter holidays , the price for premium petrol , for example , has climbed to a new annual record - this time hitting 1.36 euros -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb- per liter , or 6 euros per gallon .
in the land of mercedes , bmws and no speed limits on highways , this sharp rise by more than 5 eurocents really hurts and has drivers calling for punitive action . " i think there is a lot of speculation going on in the markets now , " one driver commented , adding that it 's time the authorities stopped oil companies from driving petrol prices ever higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holiday time in germany means increased traffic on the roads many motorists , however , feel the government is part of the problem as it has been imposing more and more new taxes on fuel in recent years . taxes , drive for profits to blame in the past few years , petrol prices have indeed climbed steadily - partly as a result of a so-called ecology tax imposed on fuels and energy in germany .
but consumer advocacy groups are claiming that oil companies have used this as a pretext to raise prices excessively . they also accuse oil companies of using days of heightened traffic , such as the long easter weekend , to rake in easy profits . rolf-peter rocke of the german adac motorists ' association says this practice is especially apparent in regions with few petrol stations . " companies are cashing in especially in regions where there is little competition , " he said .
" on the island of rügen for example , people can hardly compare prices because there are only around five petrol stations .
in towns and cities , however , drivers have this option and should now really make use of their freedom to choose so that prices will eventually come down again . " us situation also a factor but heino elfert from the german energy watchdog energieinformationsdienst says oil companies are only partly to blame for the current sky-high prices . " as in previous years around this time , petrol prices have even outpaced high prices for oil because of depleted gasoline stocks in the united states , " elfert said .
" since american refineries are unable to meet the domestic demand they need to buy huge volumes of gasoline on the world market . " for german drivers , understanding the causes of their pain at the pump is just cold comfort .
increasingly , german consumers are buying cars that run on alternative fuels such as natural gas or diesel made from rapeseed . but in spite of the boom in automotive alternatives here , the next public outrage over petrol prices is just as sure to come as the next holiday season . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .

" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said it had made fuel with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with long-running stand-off looking set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . the united states has been prodding the security council to take a tough stand against the islamic republic , including possible sanctions , but it has run into opposition from veto-wielding members russia and china . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said consultations on how to tackle the regime were ongoing , but sidestepped the question of what action could be taken .
" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has declared iran a nuclear power ahmadinejad also said iran was working on advanced p2 centrifuges - highly efficient devices that can enrich far more effectively than the p1 technology currently in use in iran .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran said it had made fuel with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with long-running stand-off looking set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . the united states has been prodding the security council to take a tough stand against the islamic republic , including possible sanctions , but it has run into opposition from veto-wielding members russia and china . white house spokesman scott mcclellan said consultations on how to tackle the regime were ongoing , but sidestepped the question of what action could be taken .
" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has declared iran a nuclear power ahmadinejad also said iran was working on advanced p2 centrifuges - highly efficient devices that can enrich far more effectively than the p1 technology currently in use in iran .

both osthoff and the chrobog family were released unharmed by their captors . " i have the impression that in those cases … other standards were applied , " said berndt at the latest of the regular vigils that are being held in the engineers ' hometown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team dealing with the kidnapping has had little success she said many people could not understand that even after 11 weeks of work by the crisis team assembled after the men were taken hostage , no progress had been made .
the osthoff and chrobog cases were resolved more quickly , she said . " the importance of those cases should n't be considered higher than the case of our co-workers , " she said , calling on the federal government " to pull out all the stops to support the work of the crisis team . " christian führer , the pastor of leipzig 's nikolaikirche , joined in the calls for more action by the government , saying it should explore all the possible options , including " asking for the help of other nations , for example arabic states . " ransom demands according to a report in the newsmagazine focus , the kidnappers are asking for a ransom of 9.9 million euros -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- for the men 's release .
the magazine based its report on sources close to the crisis team , which has contacts to middlemen in iraq . on friday , the foreign ministry refused to comment on the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still image from the lastest video clip of the kidnapped engineers after analysis of a new video of the hostages posted on an islamic web site on sunday , the magazine report says the crisis team is not ruling out the possibility that the hostages had been " sold " to a criminal organization in iraq .
the political demands made by the hostage takers , which have changed several times over the course of time , indicate to analysts that a criminal group could be involved . bräunlich , 32 , and nitschke , 28 , were kidnapped in northern iraq on january 24 while working on several short-term contracts for the cryotec firm .
the latest video , which was dated march 28 and is 24 seconds in length , showed both men looking drawn and haggard . " we have been held captive here for more than 60 days , " pleaded nitzschke as he addressed the german government .
" we are close to breaking point .

" we are cooperating in a constructive manner ... and mr. elbaradei is here and the inspectors and cameras are here , so such a proposal is not very important to solve the problem , " larijani told reporters . hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad also vowed there was " no room for defeat and retreat . " elbaradei 's 24-hour visit comes two days after iran announced its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is a peaceful bid to generate electricity , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead . elbaradei said his inspectors had taken samples to verify iran 's claim of a breakthrough in enrichment , and added that talks focusing on the demand for a suspension would continue .
bildunterschrift : elbaradei talked with iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , in tehran on thursday " to build confidence we agreed that we will continue an intensive dialogue in the next few weeks with the aim of being able to move forward on this difficult and important issue , " he said .
he said the only other result of the talks was an iranian promise to " accelerate its efforts to work with us in next couple of weeks to provide clarity to the issue that we need to clarify " - the kind of assurance he has heard before .
elbaradei : picture still hazy the iaea chief must give a report at the end of april on iranian compliance with the security council deadline . after three years of investigations , the iaea says it is still not in a position to say if iran 's ambitions are peaceful . elbaradei said " the picture is still hazy and not very clear . " in further diplomatic efforts , china announced that its assistant foreign minister would travel to iran and russia to discuss iran 's announcement in a bid to calm the growing tensions .
" we are concerned about the announcement and are also worried about the possible development of the situation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told a regular press conference .

" i think the international community is united in our concern and determination to prevent the regime from developing a nuclear weapons capability or nuclear weapons , and we 'll continue those consultations about what the next steps would be , " he said .
iran undaunted but oil-rich iran has vowed it can weather any sanctions and face off an attack , and instead of slamming the brakes on enrichment has vowed to accelerate the process and reach an industrial-scale fuel production capacity . " the enemies think they can stop iran 's development with a psychological war , propaganda and political pressure .
but they do not know the iranian nation is standing solid like a mountain and there is no room for defeat and retreat , " state television quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
" today iran is a nuclear country and enjoys the position of a powerful country . " the breakthrough in making fuel was with 164 centrifuges at a pilot plant in natanz , and a senior official said iran wanted to install 3,000 centrifuges within the next year .

lien chan is in the chinese capital beijing for two days of talks with the communist party .
he is due to meet president hu jintao on sunday .
mr lien is leading a delegation of more than 100 taiwanese opposition politicians and business people .
the visit has attracted criticism from government supporters in taiwan .
' shared prosperity ' mr lien told a forum on cross-strait economic ties that the absence of direct transport links was an obstacle to further development .
" without the resources of the mainland , taiwan can not go far , " he said .
and he urged against demonising china and treating it " as a threat " .
" faced with china 's rise , we should be benign , optimistic and focused on co-existence and shared prosperity , " he said .

" we should have more exchanges in key industrial sectors and set up a mechanism to share research resources , thus improving innovation capabilities , " he said .
mr lien visited beijing in april 2005 , the first meeting between the leaders of the kuomintang and the chinese communist party since the kuomintang lost the civil war and fled to taiwan in 1949 .
his visit has attracted criticism in taiwan amid a debate over expanding commercial ties with china .
analysts have suggested beijing 's overtures to taiwan 's opposition are an attempt to isolate president chen shui-bian , who leans towards formal independence for taiwan .
china regards taiwan as a renegade province that must be re-united with the mainland .
last year beijing passed a law to allow the use of force if taiwan formally declares independence .

mr howard has consistently denied knowledge of the alleged kickbacks after three months of testimony , investigators finally had their chance to quiz prime minister john howard about what he knew about bribes that australia 's monopoly wheat exporter had allegedly paid to saddam hussein .
awb ltd is accused of funnelling millions of dollars in kickbacks to the former iraqi leader to win lucrative grain contracts under the un 's oil-for-food programme .
the bucks ended up with saddam hussein but the policy buck stops with john howard opposition leader kim beazley but instead of fireworks and drama , the commission heard a series of flat denials from a master politician .
sydney 's daily telegraph said simply that the prime minister " blandly answered a few questions and left " .
the cross-examination lasted just over 40 minutes and was far from taxing .
carefully managed critics have said that is hardly surprising given that mr howard established the inquiry himself and carefully set out its terms of reference .
the prime minister decided what parts of the murky oil-for-food business can and can not be judged .
there are strict no-go areas .
exports to iraq play a major role in australia 's wheat industry the behaviour of the government in the wheat-for-weapons scandal is off-limits .
the hearing does not have the authority to question the competence of ministers .
its job is to determine if awb staff broke any australian laws in their dealings with saddam .
if they did then the inquiry can recommend that charges be brought .
protesters tried their best to unsettle john howard as he strolled to the court-room at a city centre office block in sydney .
" liar , howard , you 're a liar !
stinking liar ! " shouted one irate demonstrator .
the veteran conservative was the third high-profile member of the government to testify this week , following his deputy mark vaile and trusted foreign minister alexander downer .
mr howard has always maintained he has nothing to hide .
" by appearing , by establishing the inquiry , by seeing two senior ministers appear , this government has demonstrated its transparency , " he has said .
all three men insisted they did not read or receive diplomatic cables that warned that awb might be involved in corruption .
these letters dated back to 2000 and raised concerns about the company 's dealings in iraq .
critics want to know what happened to these important pieces of intelligence - 21 documents in total - that were sent over a period of four years .
opposition fury the opposition believes that senior ministers must have known what was going on .
if they did n't they were asleep on the job and should resign .
either way the awb affair is a scandal on a gigantic scale , according to leader of the labor opposition kim beazley : " this is a shocking national security failure , " he fumed .
" the bucks ended up with saddam hussein but the policy buck stops with john howard . "
the government , which sent troops to join the us-led invasion of iraq , has said the first it knew of the corruption allegations surrounding awb was in october last year .
june deadline a un report stated that the australian exporter , along with dozens of other companies , had paid bribes to iraq under the oil-for-food scheme .
the programme ran from 1996 to 2003 and allowed baghdad to sell oil to raise funds to buy food and medicine to help civilians hit by sanctions against saddam hussein .
awb was the largest single supplier of humanitarian goods .
the sydney inquiry headed by retired judge terence cole is due to hand down its findings by the end of june .
as it stands , the howard administration should avoid any major damage .
there would need to be some spectacular , and unexpected , evidence in the commission 's final weeks for it to take a real hit .
opinion polls suggest that most australians are more worried about rising fuel costs than allegations of bribery in a distant country .
" clearly , the howard government sees the cole inquiry as being about as politically dangerous as the revelation that john howard wears odd socks , " wrote greg craven from curtin university in the australian financial review newspaper .
however , for awb executives , who have denied any wrongdoing , the next few months could well be far more stressful .
