he was discovered last year , and brought back to chile to stand trial for the mistreatment of 25 children in his former cult colony , ‘ colonia dignidad ’ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäfer was only discovered last after 10 years in hiding in addition , the judge ordered schäfer to pay reparations totaling $ 1.4 million to 11 of his victims . a lawyer for the victims said wednesday 's " conviction ends 40 years of impunity and means justice for all the victims who , at the time , had no way to tell how they had been victimized . " schäfer apparently lured children from local farms into the cult ’ s free school and clinic .
it was only when chilean mothers came forward in 1997 to complain that an investigation was opened . isolated and secretive commune schäfer founded the religious farming commune ‘ colonia dignidad ’ in the 1960 ’ s , when he traveled over to chile with around 300 other german immigrants . the group was largely isolated from the outside world : no telephones or televisions , and schäfer was apparently regarded as the cult ’ s god .
at the time he left germany , schäfer was also wanted on child abuse charges here .
however , berlin did not issue any extradition requests when he was arrested in argentina last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female german resident of " colonia dignidad " according to former cult members , paul schäfer had been abusing children for years , forcing them to live away from their parents and closing off contact with the outside world .
in april last year , former cult members apologized and asked for forgiveness for 40 years of sex and human rights abuses in their colony .
they claimed they were brainwashed by schäfer . the commune has since renamed itself ‘ villa bavaria ’ , and only began re-establishing regular contact with the outside world last year . links to pinochet paul schäfer also faces human rights abuse charges , for aiding the regime of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet .
he apparently fostered close relations with the dictator , and allowed pinochet to use his farming commune as a detention and torture centre for political prisoners . government investigators uncovered a weapons cache , and a secret cemetery on the property of the former cult last year . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-german soldier charged with torturing children in chile former german army corporal paul schäfer has been charged with torturing eight children in a mysterious german enclave that he founded in chile , according to judicial sources .

" if merkel says she wo n't do 7.5 euros , well then we 'll do 7.55 euros , " dgb leader michael sommer said in response thursday .
although germany has no national minimum wage , there are agreements within various sectors between unions and management which fix basic levels . however , the dgb estimates that some 2.5 million people are working for an hourly wage of between 3.5 and four euros . unions want the elimimation of low wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer says he will not back down sommer had already said late wednesday that merkel 's proposal to top up the pay of under-paid workers " wo n't improve anything " and what was needed was an across-the-board elimination of low wages . merkel was booed and whistled at the congress when she called for a reform in the way workers ' representatives have a large say in how some big companies are run , notably in the key steel and chemicals industries . over the cacophony that met her speech , merkel struggled to be heard .
" i want strong unions .
i want a strong dgb , " merkel said .
" but the dgb , just like any other group , party or organisation , has to ask itself whether the answers of the past are still valid today . " müntefering jeered for defending merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the spd can not rely on union support the same treatment was afforded germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering when he appeared in front of the labor unions in an attempt to defend merkel and her government 's controversial policies on pensions and wages . despite the links between the unions and müntefering 's social democrats , the vice chancellor , who is also the labor minister , was heckled while trying to explain the government 's opposition to a minimum wage of 7.5 euros per hour and the decision to raise the retirement age to 67 from 65 in the coming years . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : unions demand much , yet lack vision may 1 is labor day in europe .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit .

" at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit . " we believe we can send from this summit good , positive , constructive messages regarding energy -lrb- and -rrb- about the need for a transparent and reciprocal cooperation in terms of energy , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . president putin was even more vague .
" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb . " we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier . " for president putin it will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the group of eight , " kommersant daily wrote thursday .
" the russian president will talk with eu leaders about energy security and try to stay away from the democracy subject . " he may find avoiding this embarrassing issue more difficult than he thought .
the european delegation made it clear that the issue of democracy in russia was one that they wished to address in depth in the future . " we do think that russia has a special responsibility to take forward questions like human rights , rule of law , good governance - all these basic values we in the european union hold up , " ferrero-waldner told reporters . " so we shall certainly mention that in our discussions . " russian and eu officials meeting in sochi also agreed in principle on a 20-million euro aid program for the troubled north caucasus region that includes chechnya , ferrero-waldner said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and russia meet in shadow of energy war of words russian president vladimir putin meets senior european union officials on thursday for a black sea summit marked by tensions over the security of natural gas supplied by the energy giant gazprom .

" we no longer need to worry about logistics .
now we need to get ready for what will be of utmost importance during his pilgrimage : we must be strong in the faith , " prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said after meeting with cardinal jozef glemp , the primate of poland , on the eve of the papal visit . " be strong in the faith " is the slogan of the visit of benedict xvi . " we need peace and quiet , to reflect on all that is happening within us and around us , " said marcinkiewicz , alluding to the political turmoil and social unrest that have dogged his government since he took office late last year . marcinkiewicz will be among the state and church officials , including president lech kaczynski and the apostolic nuncio to poland , archbishop jozef kowalczyk , who will welcome benedict to warsaw when his alitalia flight from rome arrives thursday morning . but before the official ceremony to welcome benedict to the land of his hugely popular predecessor , polish-born john paul ii , the okecie airport employees ' choir will greet the pope in song . " we 've rehearsed hymns in polish , english , french - we 're prepared for all the languages ! " said father slawomir kawecki , the airport chaplain . " this ceremony will be different to others , because it is n't a mass , but a welcome to the pope from the people , even before the official welcoming ceremony , " kawecki said . monks at the marian shrine in lichen , central poland , will ring poland 's biggest bell , the 14-tonne " mary mother of god " , along with the 11 other bells to welcome benedict . more than a million pilgrims expected for mass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some followers are getting their seats early the streets of warsaw , where city officials expect more than a million people to gather in central pilsudski square for a mass led by the pontiff on friday , have been festooned for weeks with posters calling german-born benedict " our pope " - an endearment long reserved for john paul ii . a bookshop on a main thoroughfare in the capital has replaced books by and about john paul ii that long had pride of place in its window display with tomes about benedict . a huge altar with a 25-metre tall cross , built for the huge open-air mass in pilsudski square , was finished early this week and will be lit up every evening until sunday , the last day of benedict 's visit . the structure 's design is based on the altar from which john paul ii addressed his fellow poles in pilsudski square in 1979 , urging them to " not be afraid " and calling on the " spirit to come down and renew the face of this land " . that call was interpreted by many poles as an exhortation to stand up to communism . benedict to visit predecessor 's home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was an inspiration to his people in wadowice , families have been reciting the rosary together to prepare for benedict 's visit to the birthplace of his predecessor on saturday . wadowice 's faithful have also gathered on the second day of each month outside the house where john paul ii was born to sing " barka " , one of john paul ii 's favorite hymns , and listen to a bugler 's solemn call at 9:37 pm . john paul ii died in rome on april 2 last year at 9:37 pm . " families are a home church on which so much depends .
it is on the maturity of families that the maturity of the church rests .
there is great power in the families of wadowice .

he was discovered last year , and brought back to chile to stand trial for the mistreatment of 25 children in his former cult colony , ‘ colonia dignidad ’ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäfer was only discovered last after 10 years in hiding in addition , the judge ordered schäfer to pay reparations totaling $ 1.4 million to 11 of his victims . a lawyer for the victims said wednesday 's " conviction ends 40 years of impunity and means justice for all the victims who , at the time , had no way to tell how they had been victimized .

they claimed they were brainwashed by schäfer . the commune has since renamed itself ‘ villa bavaria ’ , and only began re-establishing regular contact with the outside world last year . links to pinochet paul schäfer also faces human rights abuse charges , for aiding the regime of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet .
he apparently fostered close relations with the dictator , and allowed pinochet to use his farming commune as a detention and torture centre for political prisoners . government investigators uncovered a weapons cache , and a secret cemetery on the property of the former cult last year . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-german soldier charged with torturing children in chile former german army corporal paul schäfer has been charged with torturing eight children in a mysterious german enclave that he founded in chile , according to judicial sources .

" over recent years , we 've sensed an east wind rising .
the 2006 selection confirms it , " fremaux said . a vintage year this promises to be a vintage year for a number of eastern european countries . " we 've not had so many films in cannes for 20 years , so it 's an exceptional year for us , " the hungarian industry 's csaba zoltan papp told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish director roman polanski won the palme d 'or four years ago for his film " the pianist " poland and romania , which has a stand here for the first time , are also both strongly represented in the lower-key , but still prestigious , ancillary events held alongside the competition for the coveted palme d 'or . the region has always produced some outstanding prize-winning filmmakers including poland 's krzystof kieslowski whose three-part " red , " " white " and " blue " film series won him fans around the world . serbia 's emir kusturica has the distinction of having scooped the top cannes honors on two occasions - in 1985 , with " when father was away on business " and again in 1995 with his film " underground . " the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child .

she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

" if merkel says she wo n't do 7.5 euros , well then we 'll do 7.55 euros , " dgb leader michael sommer said in response thursday .
although germany has no national minimum wage , there are agreements within various sectors between unions and management which fix basic levels . however , the dgb estimates that some 2.5 million people are working for an hourly wage of between 3.5 and four euros . unions want the elimimation of low wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer says he will not back down sommer had already said late wednesday that merkel 's proposal to top up the pay of under-paid workers " wo n't improve anything " and what was needed was an across-the-board elimination of low wages . merkel was booed and whistled at the congress when she called for a reform in the way workers ' representatives have a large say in how some big companies are run , notably in the key steel and chemicals industries . over the cacophony that met her speech , merkel struggled to be heard .
" i want strong unions .
i want a strong dgb , " merkel said .
" but the dgb , just like any other group , party or organisation , has to ask itself whether the answers of the past are still valid today . " müntefering jeered for defending merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the spd can not rely on union support the same treatment was afforded germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering when he appeared in front of the labor unions in an attempt to defend merkel and her government 's controversial policies on pensions and wages . despite the links between the unions and müntefering 's social democrats , the vice chancellor , who is also the labor minister , was heckled while trying to explain the government 's opposition to a minimum wage of 7.5 euros per hour and the decision to raise the retirement age to 67 from 65 in the coming years . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : unions demand much , yet lack vision may 1 is labor day in europe .

he was discovered last year , and brought back to chile to stand trial for the mistreatment of 25 children in his former cult colony , ‘ colonia dignidad ’ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäfer was only discovered last after 10 years in hiding in addition , the judge ordered schäfer to pay reparations totaling $ 1.4 million to 11 of his victims . a lawyer for the victims said wednesday 's " conviction ends 40 years of impunity and means justice for all the victims who , at the time , had no way to tell how they had been victimized . " schäfer apparently lured children from local farms into the cult ’ s free school and clinic .
it was only when chilean mothers came forward in 1997 to complain that an investigation was opened . isolated and secretive commune schäfer founded the religious farming commune ‘ colonia dignidad ’ in the 1960 ’ s , when he traveled over to chile with around 300 other german immigrants . the group was largely isolated from the outside world : no telephones or televisions , and schäfer was apparently regarded as the cult ’ s god .
at the time he left germany , schäfer was also wanted on child abuse charges here .
however , berlin did not issue any extradition requests when he was arrested in argentina last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female german resident of " colonia dignidad " according to former cult members , paul schäfer had been abusing children for years , forcing them to live away from their parents and closing off contact with the outside world .

they claimed they were brainwashed by schäfer . the commune has since renamed itself ‘ villa bavaria ’ , and only began re-establishing regular contact with the outside world last year . links to pinochet paul schäfer also faces human rights abuse charges , for aiding the regime of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet .
he apparently fostered close relations with the dictator , and allowed pinochet to use his farming commune as a detention and torture centre for political prisoners . government investigators uncovered a weapons cache , and a secret cemetery on the property of the former cult last year . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-german soldier charged with torturing children in chile former german army corporal paul schäfer has been charged with torturing eight children in a mysterious german enclave that he founded in chile , according to judicial sources .

" he called for restraint in making " facile accusations in the absence of real proof " and for those who stand accused to show " humble sincerity and not to deny the sins of the past . " a week before the pope 's arrival in poland , polish priest michal czajkowski , who is known in his native land for his work in reconciling christians and jews , was accused in a press report of having been a communist agent for 24 years . " the country of my beloved predecessor " " i have come to follow in the footsteps of john paul ii , along the path of his life , " benedict said in polish to cheers from the crowd of airport staff and dignitaries who were on hand to greet him .
" this is not just a sentimental journey , but a journey of faith . " " i want to drink at the abundant spring of your faith , which has flowed incessantly for more than a millennium , " he added . benedict 's alitalia flight from rome touched down at warsaw 's okecie airport shortly before 11:00 a.m.

a military band stood to attention . " i am happy to be here , among you , on the soil of the polish republic , " he said .
" i so wanted to visit the country of my beloved predecessor , the servant of god john paul ii , and to be here , among his country people . " kaczynski , in a nod to often turbulent polish-german relations in the past , welcomed the pope and spoke of spiritual reconciliation . " providence has deemed that a german has succeeded a pole on the throne of saint peter , " he said .
" our two peoples , who are very close , have often been separated by history .
today we feel that true reconciliation can only be achieved on a spiritual dimension . " " long live the pope " after the official welcome , benedict set off in a motorcade , bound for st. john 's cathedral in the centre of warsaw , to meet with members of the clergy . thousands of poles lined the streets of the capital to welcome the pope .
some cried , in polish , " long live the pope , " others held aloft the yellow and white flag of the vatican , letting it flutter in the brisk spring breeze . after passing through the old town , carefully rebuilt after it was completely destroyed in world war ii , the papal motorcade drove past the monument to the victims of the warsaw ghetto , where poland 's nazi occupiers isolated the capital 's thriving pre-war jewish community . but to the disappointment of the crowd gathered there , it neither slowed nor stopped to allow the pontiff to descend and pay tribute to the jews who were terrorized in wartime warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : native son john paul ii is still mourned in his homeland the pope also passed in front of a monument to poles deported and killed in the former soviet union , and one to the tragic 1944 warsaw uprising against the germans . the city was almost entirely destroyed in the closing phases of world war ii , and the country 's jewish population of around 3.5 million obliterated . like most german boys , benedict was enrolled into the hitler youth , but he took no part in fighting and later deserted the army . going to auschwitz as a catholic the first day of the papal visit was to be devoted mainly to meetings with polish officials and members of the clergy . on friday , benedict xvi will lead a huge open-air mass in warsaw 's central pilsudski square , which is expected to draw around one million faithful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will visit auschwitz as a " catholic , not a german " in his speech at the airport , benedict spoke in italian about the rest of his itinerary after warsaw , which will take him south to key sites in the life and papacy of john paul ii , culminating sunday at the nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau . " i hope to meet there survivors , the victims of nazi terror , from the many nations which suffered this tragic oppression , " benedict said .
" we will pray together that the wounds of the past century are healed by the medicine of god , who calls on us to forgive each other and offers us the mystery of the divine mercy . " on the flight to poland , benedict had told reporters that he was going to auschwitz " first and foremost as a catholic , " not as a german .

" we 've not had so many films in cannes for 20 years , so it 's an exceptional year for us , " the hungarian industry 's csaba zoltan papp told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish director roman polanski won the palme d 'or four years ago for his film " the pianist " poland and romania , which has a stand here for the first time , are also both strongly represented in the lower-key , but still prestigious , ancillary events held alongside the competition for the coveted palme d 'or . the region has always produced some outstanding prize-winning filmmakers including poland 's krzystof kieslowski whose three-part " red , " " white " and " blue " film series won him fans around the world . serbia 's emir kusturica has the distinction of having scooped the top cannes honors on two occasions - in 1985 , with " when father was away on business " and again in 1995 with his film " underground . " the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child . " taxidermia " by young hungarian director gyorgy palfy has already been sold internationally after creating a box office sensation at home with its lurid scenes of feasting , drunkeness and debauchery . mood buoyant there is also a wide choice of promising films outside the " un certain regard " event . young hungarian director , agnes kocsis , who is fresh out of film school , is attracting a lot of attention .
she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

" energy security will be high on the list of subjects , " said vladimir shizhov , russia 's ambassador to brussels , ahead of around three hours of eu-russia talks in the resort city of sochi . since the russia-ukraine gas crisis in january , when gazprom turned off the taps in a price war and hit supplies being piped through to western europe , concerns about energy security have spiraled into a war of words . the eu , the world 's second largest energy market and which imports about 20 percent of its natural gas needs from russia , wants reassurances that the problem will not be repeated in the future . but with brussels , on a widespread drive to boost competition , also expressing concern about gazprom 's monopoly position , russia wants reassurances of continuing demand for its resources in 10 or 20 years . eu plan to limit russian dependence irking putin " we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said last month .
" what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets . " " when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " he said . the russia-ukraine gas crisis , coupled with the heightened rhetoric , exposed gaping weaknesses in eu energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence that natural resources can have on foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants to secure russian energy for the eu analysts say it also revealed a newfound confidence in moscow under putin , who will meet thursday with european commission head jose manuel barroso , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . " they 've been saying all this for years .
what is different is that they are now saying it in a loud voice , " said dov lynch , head of eu-russia relations at the eu institute of security studies . " what has changed is that the eu has become conscious of how urgent the energy security problem is and the rise in confidence in russia on this issue , " he said . officials in brussels believe that energy issues could be included from next year in the eu-russia partnership , created in 1996 and currently being renegotiated . europeans want transparency , competition , reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears a repeat of gazprom 's show of strength in ukraine but the eu 's spokeswoman on external relations , emma udwin , said europe 's concerns about the gazprom monopoly will have to be taken into account .
" we are underlining that if a deeper energy partnership is going to be part of this new agreement , it should be governed by the same kind of principles that govern our economic partnership , " she told reporters on tuesday . " it means transparency , it means competition and it means reciprocity . " " this is a two-way street .
it is true that russia is a very , very important supplier for the eu ... but it is also the case that we are not just a customer for russia , we are at the present time the customer for russia , " she said . apart from laying the cornerstones for their new partnership agreement , the only concrete development that is likely in sochi is the signing of an accord easing visa requirements between brussels and moscow . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

" we no longer need to worry about logistics .
now we need to get ready for what will be of utmost importance during his pilgrimage : we must be strong in the faith , " prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said after meeting with cardinal jozef glemp , the primate of poland , on the eve of the papal visit . " be strong in the faith " is the slogan of the visit of benedict xvi . " we need peace and quiet , to reflect on all that is happening within us and around us , " said marcinkiewicz , alluding to the political turmoil and social unrest that have dogged his government since he took office late last year . marcinkiewicz will be among the state and church officials , including president lech kaczynski and the apostolic nuncio to poland , archbishop jozef kowalczyk , who will welcome benedict to warsaw when his alitalia flight from rome arrives thursday morning . but before the official ceremony to welcome benedict to the land of his hugely popular predecessor , polish-born john paul ii , the okecie airport employees ' choir will greet the pope in song . " we 've rehearsed hymns in polish , english , french - we 're prepared for all the languages ! " said father slawomir kawecki , the airport chaplain . " this ceremony will be different to others , because it is n't a mass , but a welcome to the pope from the people , even before the official welcoming ceremony , " kawecki said . monks at the marian shrine in lichen , central poland , will ring poland 's biggest bell , the 14-tonne " mary mother of god " , along with the 11 other bells to welcome benedict . more than a million pilgrims expected for mass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some followers are getting their seats early the streets of warsaw , where city officials expect more than a million people to gather in central pilsudski square for a mass led by the pontiff on friday , have been festooned for weeks with posters calling german-born benedict " our pope " - an endearment long reserved for john paul ii . a bookshop on a main thoroughfare in the capital has replaced books by and about john paul ii that long had pride of place in its window display with tomes about benedict . a huge altar with a 25-metre tall cross , built for the huge open-air mass in pilsudski square , was finished early this week and will be lit up every evening until sunday , the last day of benedict 's visit . the structure 's design is based on the altar from which john paul ii addressed his fellow poles in pilsudski square in 1979 , urging them to " not be afraid " and calling on the " spirit to come down and renew the face of this land " . that call was interpreted by many poles as an exhortation to stand up to communism . benedict to visit predecessor 's home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was an inspiration to his people in wadowice , families have been reciting the rosary together to prepare for benedict 's visit to the birthplace of his predecessor on saturday . wadowice 's faithful have also gathered on the second day of each month outside the house where john paul ii was born to sing " barka " , one of john paul ii 's favorite hymns , and listen to a bugler 's solemn call at 9:37 pm . john paul ii died in rome on april 2 last year at 9:37 pm . " families are a home church on which so much depends .

he was discovered last year , and brought back to chile to stand trial for the mistreatment of 25 children in his former cult colony , ‘ colonia dignidad ’ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäfer was only discovered last after 10 years in hiding in addition , the judge ordered schäfer to pay reparations totaling $ 1.4 million to 11 of his victims . a lawyer for the victims said wednesday 's " conviction ends 40 years of impunity and means justice for all the victims who , at the time , had no way to tell how they had been victimized . " schäfer apparently lured children from local farms into the cult ’ s free school and clinic .
it was only when chilean mothers came forward in 1997 to complain that an investigation was opened . isolated and secretive commune schäfer founded the religious farming commune ‘ colonia dignidad ’ in the 1960 ’ s , when he traveled over to chile with around 300 other german immigrants . the group was largely isolated from the outside world : no telephones or televisions , and schäfer was apparently regarded as the cult ’ s god .
at the time he left germany , schäfer was also wanted on child abuse charges here .
however , berlin did not issue any extradition requests when he was arrested in argentina last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female german resident of " colonia dignidad " according to former cult members , paul schäfer had been abusing children for years , forcing them to live away from their parents and closing off contact with the outside world .
in april last year , former cult members apologized and asked for forgiveness for 40 years of sex and human rights abuses in their colony .
they claimed they were brainwashed by schäfer . the commune has since renamed itself ‘ villa bavaria ’ , and only began re-establishing regular contact with the outside world last year . links to pinochet paul schäfer also faces human rights abuse charges , for aiding the regime of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet .
he apparently fostered close relations with the dictator , and allowed pinochet to use his farming commune as a detention and torture centre for political prisoners . government investigators uncovered a weapons cache , and a secret cemetery on the property of the former cult last year . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-german soldier charged with torturing children in chile former german army corporal paul schäfer has been charged with torturing eight children in a mysterious german enclave that he founded in chile , according to judicial sources .

" he called for restraint in making " facile accusations in the absence of real proof " and for those who stand accused to show " humble sincerity and not to deny the sins of the past . " a week before the pope 's arrival in poland , polish priest michal czajkowski , who is known in his native land for his work in reconciling christians and jews , was accused in a press report of having been a communist agent for 24 years .

" he called for restraint in making " facile accusations in the absence of real proof " and for those who stand accused to show " humble sincerity and not to deny the sins of the past . " a week before the pope 's arrival in poland , polish priest michal czajkowski , who is known in his native land for his work in reconciling christians and jews , was accused in a press report of having been a communist agent for 24 years . " the country of my beloved predecessor " " i have come to follow in the footsteps of john paul ii , along the path of his life , " benedict said in polish to cheers from the crowd of airport staff and dignitaries who were on hand to greet him .
" this is not just a sentimental journey , but a journey of faith . " " i want to drink at the abundant spring of your faith , which has flowed incessantly for more than a millennium , " he added . benedict 's alitalia flight from rome touched down at warsaw 's okecie airport shortly before 11:00 a.m.
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have been eagerly awaiting the pontiff a blustery wind ruffled his white papal cloak as he descended the steps of the plane to hymns entoned by a choir of airport employees . gusts of wind bore the sound of tolling church bells while benedict shook hands warmly with state and church dignitaries , including polish president lech kaczynski , cardinal primate jozef glemp and archbishop of krakow stanislaw dziwisz .
a military band stood to attention . " i am happy to be here , among you , on the soil of the polish republic , " he said .
" i so wanted to visit the country of my beloved predecessor , the servant of god john paul ii , and to be here , among his country people . " kaczynski , in a nod to often turbulent polish-german relations in the past , welcomed the pope and spoke of spiritual reconciliation . " providence has deemed that a german has succeeded a pole on the throne of saint peter , " he said .
" our two peoples , who are very close , have often been separated by history .
today we feel that true reconciliation can only be achieved on a spiritual dimension .

some cried , in polish , " long live the pope , " others held aloft the yellow and white flag of the vatican , letting it flutter in the brisk spring breeze . after passing through the old town , carefully rebuilt after it was completely destroyed in world war ii , the papal motorcade drove past the monument to the victims of the warsaw ghetto , where poland 's nazi occupiers isolated the capital 's thriving pre-war jewish community . but to the disappointment of the crowd gathered there , it neither slowed nor stopped to allow the pontiff to descend and pay tribute to the jews who were terrorized in wartime warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : native son john paul ii is still mourned in his homeland the pope also passed in front of a monument to poles deported and killed in the former soviet union , and one to the tragic 1944 warsaw uprising against the germans . the city was almost entirely destroyed in the closing phases of world war ii , and the country 's jewish population of around 3.5 million obliterated . like most german boys , benedict was enrolled into the hitler youth , but he took no part in fighting and later deserted the army . going to auschwitz as a catholic the first day of the papal visit was to be devoted mainly to meetings with polish officials and members of the clergy . on friday , benedict xvi will lead a huge open-air mass in warsaw 's central pilsudski square , which is expected to draw around one million faithful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will visit auschwitz as a " catholic , not a german " in his speech at the airport , benedict spoke in italian about the rest of his itinerary after warsaw , which will take him south to key sites in the life and papacy of john paul ii , culminating sunday at the nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau . " i hope to meet there survivors , the victims of nazi terror , from the many nations which suffered this tragic oppression , " benedict said .
" we will pray together that the wounds of the past century are healed by the medicine of god , who calls on us to forgive each other and offers us the mystery of the divine mercy . " on the flight to poland , benedict had told reporters that he was going to auschwitz " first and foremost as a catholic , " not as a german .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit . " we believe we can send from this summit good , positive , constructive messages regarding energy -lrb- and -rrb- about the need for a transparent and reciprocal cooperation in terms of energy , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . president putin was even more vague .
" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb . " we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier . " for president putin it will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the group of eight , " kommersant daily wrote thursday .

the european delegation made it clear that the issue of democracy in russia was one that they wished to address in depth in the future .

" this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world .

he was discovered last year , and brought back to chile to stand trial for the mistreatment of 25 children in his former cult colony , ‘ colonia dignidad ’ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäfer was only discovered last after 10 years in hiding in addition , the judge ordered schäfer to pay reparations totaling $ 1.4 million to 11 of his victims . a lawyer for the victims said wednesday 's " conviction ends 40 years of impunity and means justice for all the victims who , at the time , had no way to tell how they had been victimized . " schäfer apparently lured children from local farms into the cult ’ s free school and clinic .
it was only when chilean mothers came forward in 1997 to complain that an investigation was opened . isolated and secretive commune schäfer founded the religious farming commune ‘ colonia dignidad ’ in the 1960 ’ s , when he traveled over to chile with around 300 other german immigrants . the group was largely isolated from the outside world : no telephones or televisions , and schäfer was apparently regarded as the cult ’ s god .
at the time he left germany , schäfer was also wanted on child abuse charges here .
however , berlin did not issue any extradition requests when he was arrested in argentina last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female german resident of " colonia dignidad " according to former cult members , paul schäfer had been abusing children for years , forcing them to live away from their parents and closing off contact with the outside world .
in april last year , former cult members apologized and asked for forgiveness for 40 years of sex and human rights abuses in their colony .
they claimed they were brainwashed by schäfer . the commune has since renamed itself ‘ villa bavaria ’ , and only began re-establishing regular contact with the outside world last year . links to pinochet paul schäfer also faces human rights abuse charges , for aiding the regime of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet .

" he called for restraint in making " facile accusations in the absence of real proof " and for those who stand accused to show " humble sincerity and not to deny the sins of the past . " a week before the pope 's arrival in poland , polish priest michal czajkowski , who is known in his native land for his work in reconciling christians and jews , was accused in a press report of having been a communist agent for 24 years . " the country of my beloved predecessor " " i have come to follow in the footsteps of john paul ii , along the path of his life , " benedict said in polish to cheers from the crowd of airport staff and dignitaries who were on hand to greet him .
" this is not just a sentimental journey , but a journey of faith . " " i want to drink at the abundant spring of your faith , which has flowed incessantly for more than a millennium , " he added . benedict 's alitalia flight from rome touched down at warsaw 's okecie airport shortly before 11:00 a.m.
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have been eagerly awaiting the pontiff a blustery wind ruffled his white papal cloak as he descended the steps of the plane to hymns entoned by a choir of airport employees . gusts of wind bore the sound of tolling church bells while benedict shook hands warmly with state and church dignitaries , including polish president lech kaczynski , cardinal primate jozef glemp and archbishop of krakow stanislaw dziwisz .
a military band stood to attention . " i am happy to be here , among you , on the soil of the polish republic , " he said .
" i so wanted to visit the country of my beloved predecessor , the servant of god john paul ii , and to be here , among his country people . " kaczynski , in a nod to often turbulent polish-german relations in the past , welcomed the pope and spoke of spiritual reconciliation . " providence has deemed that a german has succeeded a pole on the throne of saint peter , " he said .
" our two peoples , who are very close , have often been separated by history .
today we feel that true reconciliation can only be achieved on a spiritual dimension . " " long live the pope " after the official welcome , benedict set off in a motorcade , bound for st. john 's cathedral in the centre of warsaw , to meet with members of the clergy . thousands of poles lined the streets of the capital to welcome the pope .
some cried , in polish , " long live the pope , " others held aloft the yellow and white flag of the vatican , letting it flutter in the brisk spring breeze . after passing through the old town , carefully rebuilt after it was completely destroyed in world war ii , the papal motorcade drove past the monument to the victims of the warsaw ghetto , where poland 's nazi occupiers isolated the capital 's thriving pre-war jewish community . but to the disappointment of the crowd gathered there , it neither slowed nor stopped to allow the pontiff to descend and pay tribute to the jews who were terrorized in wartime warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : native son john paul ii is still mourned in his homeland the pope also passed in front of a monument to poles deported and killed in the former soviet union , and one to the tragic 1944 warsaw uprising against the germans . the city was almost entirely destroyed in the closing phases of world war ii , and the country 's jewish population of around 3.5 million obliterated . like most german boys , benedict was enrolled into the hitler youth , but he took no part in fighting and later deserted the army . going to auschwitz as a catholic the first day of the papal visit was to be devoted mainly to meetings with polish officials and members of the clergy . on friday , benedict xvi will lead a huge open-air mass in warsaw 's central pilsudski square , which is expected to draw around one million faithful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will visit auschwitz as a " catholic , not a german " in his speech at the airport , benedict spoke in italian about the rest of his itinerary after warsaw , which will take him south to key sites in the life and papacy of john paul ii , culminating sunday at the nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau . " i hope to meet there survivors , the victims of nazi terror , from the many nations which suffered this tragic oppression , " benedict said .
" we will pray together that the wounds of the past century are healed by the medicine of god , who calls on us to forgive each other and offers us the mystery of the divine mercy . " on the flight to poland , benedict had told reporters that he was going to auschwitz " first and foremost as a catholic , " not as a german . " it is very important to understand that we are catholics and catholicism embraces all nationalities , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland prepares songs and prayers for pope 's visit poland put the finishing touches on preparations for the visit of pope benedict xvi , as people in the overwhelmingly catholic country focused on their spiritual readiness to welcome the german pontiff .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit .

" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb .

" at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit . " we believe we can send from this summit good , positive , constructive messages regarding energy -lrb- and -rrb- about the need for a transparent and reciprocal cooperation in terms of energy , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . president putin was even more vague .
" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb . " we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier . " for president putin it will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the group of eight , " kommersant daily wrote thursday .
" the russian president will talk with eu leaders about energy security and try to stay away from the democracy subject . " he may find avoiding this embarrassing issue more difficult than he thought .
the european delegation made it clear that the issue of democracy in russia was one that they wished to address in depth in the future . " we do think that russia has a special responsibility to take forward questions like human rights , rule of law , good governance - all these basic values we in the european union hold up , " ferrero-waldner told reporters . " so we shall certainly mention that in our discussions .

" over recent years , we 've sensed an east wind rising .
the 2006 selection confirms it , " fremaux said . a vintage year this promises to be a vintage year for a number of eastern european countries . " we 've not had so many films in cannes for 20 years , so it 's an exceptional year for us , " the hungarian industry 's csaba zoltan papp told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish director roman polanski won the palme d 'or four years ago for his film " the pianist " poland and romania , which has a stand here for the first time , are also both strongly represented in the lower-key , but still prestigious , ancillary events held alongside the competition for the coveted palme d 'or . the region has always produced some outstanding prize-winning filmmakers including poland 's krzystof kieslowski whose three-part " red , " " white " and " blue " film series won him fans around the world . serbia 's emir kusturica has the distinction of having scooped the top cannes honors on two occasions - in 1985 , with " when father was away on business " and again in 1995 with his film " underground . " the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child . " taxidermia " by young hungarian director gyorgy palfy has already been sold internationally after creating a box office sensation at home with its lurid scenes of feasting , drunkeness and debauchery . mood buoyant there is also a wide choice of promising films outside the " un certain regard " event . young hungarian director , agnes kocsis , who is fresh out of film school , is attracting a lot of attention .
she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

" if merkel says she wo n't do 7.5 euros , well then we 'll do 7.55 euros , " dgb leader michael sommer said in response thursday .
although germany has no national minimum wage , there are agreements within various sectors between unions and management which fix basic levels . however , the dgb estimates that some 2.5 million people are working for an hourly wage of between 3.5 and four euros . unions want the elimimation of low wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer says he will not back down sommer had already said late wednesday that merkel 's proposal to top up the pay of under-paid workers " wo n't improve anything " and what was needed was an across-the-board elimination of low wages . merkel was booed and whistled at the congress when she called for a reform in the way workers ' representatives have a large say in how some big companies are run , notably in the key steel and chemicals industries . over the cacophony that met her speech , merkel struggled to be heard .
" i want strong unions .
i want a strong dgb , " merkel said .
" but the dgb , just like any other group , party or organisation , has to ask itself whether the answers of the past are still valid today . " müntefering jeered for defending merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the spd can not rely on union support the same treatment was afforded germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering when he appeared in front of the labor unions in an attempt to defend merkel and her government 's controversial policies on pensions and wages . despite the links between the unions and müntefering 's social democrats , the vice chancellor , who is also the labor minister , was heckled while trying to explain the government 's opposition to a minimum wage of 7.5 euros per hour and the decision to raise the retirement age to 67 from 65 in the coming years . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : unions demand much , yet lack vision may 1 is labor day in europe .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .

" eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit . " we believe we can send from this summit good , positive , constructive messages regarding energy -lrb- and -rrb- about the need for a transparent and reciprocal cooperation in terms of energy , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . president putin was even more vague .
" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb . " we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier . " for president putin it will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the group of eight , " kommersant daily wrote thursday .

" we no longer need to worry about logistics .
now we need to get ready for what will be of utmost importance during his pilgrimage : we must be strong in the faith , " prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said after meeting with cardinal jozef glemp , the primate of poland , on the eve of the papal visit . " be strong in the faith " is the slogan of the visit of benedict xvi . " we need peace and quiet , to reflect on all that is happening within us and around us , " said marcinkiewicz , alluding to the political turmoil and social unrest that have dogged his government since he took office late last year . marcinkiewicz will be among the state and church officials , including president lech kaczynski and the apostolic nuncio to poland , archbishop jozef kowalczyk , who will welcome benedict to warsaw when his alitalia flight from rome arrives thursday morning . but before the official ceremony to welcome benedict to the land of his hugely popular predecessor , polish-born john paul ii , the okecie airport employees ' choir will greet the pope in song . " we 've rehearsed hymns in polish , english , french - we 're prepared for all the languages ! " said father slawomir kawecki , the airport chaplain . " this ceremony will be different to others , because it is n't a mass , but a welcome to the pope from the people , even before the official welcoming ceremony , " kawecki said . monks at the marian shrine in lichen , central poland , will ring poland 's biggest bell , the 14-tonne " mary mother of god " , along with the 11 other bells to welcome benedict . more than a million pilgrims expected for mass bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some followers are getting their seats early the streets of warsaw , where city officials expect more than a million people to gather in central pilsudski square for a mass led by the pontiff on friday , have been festooned for weeks with posters calling german-born benedict " our pope " - an endearment long reserved for john paul ii . a bookshop on a main thoroughfare in the capital has replaced books by and about john paul ii that long had pride of place in its window display with tomes about benedict . a huge altar with a 25-metre tall cross , built for the huge open-air mass in pilsudski square , was finished early this week and will be lit up every evening until sunday , the last day of benedict 's visit . the structure 's design is based on the altar from which john paul ii addressed his fellow poles in pilsudski square in 1979 , urging them to " not be afraid " and calling on the " spirit to come down and renew the face of this land " . that call was interpreted by many poles as an exhortation to stand up to communism . benedict to visit predecessor 's home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was an inspiration to his people in wadowice , families have been reciting the rosary together to prepare for benedict 's visit to the birthplace of his predecessor on saturday . wadowice 's faithful have also gathered on the second day of each month outside the house where john paul ii was born to sing " barka " , one of john paul ii 's favorite hymns , and listen to a bugler 's solemn call at 9:37 pm . john paul ii died in rome on april 2 last year at 9:37 pm . " families are a home church on which so much depends .

he was discovered last year , and brought back to chile to stand trial for the mistreatment of 25 children in his former cult colony , ‘ colonia dignidad ’ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäfer was only discovered last after 10 years in hiding in addition , the judge ordered schäfer to pay reparations totaling $ 1.4 million to 11 of his victims . a lawyer for the victims said wednesday 's " conviction ends 40 years of impunity and means justice for all the victims who , at the time , had no way to tell how they had been victimized . " schäfer apparently lured children from local farms into the cult ’ s free school and clinic .
it was only when chilean mothers came forward in 1997 to complain that an investigation was opened . isolated and secretive commune schäfer founded the religious farming commune ‘ colonia dignidad ’ in the 1960 ’ s , when he traveled over to chile with around 300 other german immigrants . the group was largely isolated from the outside world : no telephones or televisions , and schäfer was apparently regarded as the cult ’ s god .
at the time he left germany , schäfer was also wanted on child abuse charges here .
however , berlin did not issue any extradition requests when he was arrested in argentina last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female german resident of " colonia dignidad " according to former cult members , paul schäfer had been abusing children for years , forcing them to live away from their parents and closing off contact with the outside world .
in april last year , former cult members apologized and asked for forgiveness for 40 years of sex and human rights abuses in their colony .
they claimed they were brainwashed by schäfer . the commune has since renamed itself ‘ villa bavaria ’ , and only began re-establishing regular contact with the outside world last year . links to pinochet paul schäfer also faces human rights abuse charges , for aiding the regime of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet .
he apparently fostered close relations with the dictator , and allowed pinochet to use his farming commune as a detention and torture centre for political prisoners . government investigators uncovered a weapons cache , and a secret cemetery on the property of the former cult last year . jane conway -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-german soldier charged with torturing children in chile former german army corporal paul schäfer has been charged with torturing eight children in a mysterious german enclave that he founded in chile , according to judicial sources .

" it means transparency , it means competition and it means reciprocity . " " this is a two-way street .
it is true that russia is a very , very important supplier for the eu ... but it is also the case that we are not just a customer for russia , we are at the present time the customer for russia , " she said . apart from laying the cornerstones for their new partnership agreement , the only concrete development that is likely in sochi is the signing of an accord easing visa requirements between brussels and moscow . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit .

" we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier .

" if merkel says she wo n't do 7.5 euros , well then we 'll do 7.55 euros , " dgb leader michael sommer said in response thursday .
although germany has no national minimum wage , there are agreements within various sectors between unions and management which fix basic levels . however , the dgb estimates that some 2.5 million people are working for an hourly wage of between 3.5 and four euros . unions want the elimimation of low wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer says he will not back down sommer had already said late wednesday that merkel 's proposal to top up the pay of under-paid workers " wo n't improve anything " and what was needed was an across-the-board elimination of low wages . merkel was booed and whistled at the congress when she called for a reform in the way workers ' representatives have a large say in how some big companies are run , notably in the key steel and chemicals industries . over the cacophony that met her speech , merkel struggled to be heard .
" i want strong unions .
i want a strong dgb , " merkel said .
" but the dgb , just like any other group , party or organisation , has to ask itself whether the answers of the past are still valid today . " müntefering jeered for defending merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the spd can not rely on union support the same treatment was afforded germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering when he appeared in front of the labor unions in an attempt to defend merkel and her government 's controversial policies on pensions and wages . despite the links between the unions and müntefering 's social democrats , the vice chancellor , who is also the labor minister , was heckled while trying to explain the government 's opposition to a minimum wage of 7.5 euros per hour and the decision to raise the retirement age to 67 from 65 in the coming years . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : unions demand much , yet lack vision may 1 is labor day in europe .
this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . "
-lrb- may 1 , 2006 -rrb- germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving some serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .
but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky .
-lrb- march 4 , 2006 -rrb- germany serious about minimum wage worried that globalization will give german companies the incentive to sink wages , some politicians are getting loud about a minimum wage .
both business and some unions reject the idea .

" he called for restraint in making " facile accusations in the absence of real proof " and for those who stand accused to show " humble sincerity and not to deny the sins of the past . " a week before the pope 's arrival in poland , polish priest michal czajkowski , who is known in his native land for his work in reconciling christians and jews , was accused in a press report of having been a communist agent for 24 years . " the country of my beloved predecessor " " i have come to follow in the footsteps of john paul ii , along the path of his life , " benedict said in polish to cheers from the crowd of airport staff and dignitaries who were on hand to greet him .
" this is not just a sentimental journey , but a journey of faith . " " i want to drink at the abundant spring of your faith , which has flowed incessantly for more than a millennium , " he added . benedict 's alitalia flight from rome touched down at warsaw 's okecie airport shortly before 11:00 a.m.
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have been eagerly awaiting the pontiff a blustery wind ruffled his white papal cloak as he descended the steps of the plane to hymns entoned by a choir of airport employees . gusts of wind bore the sound of tolling church bells while benedict shook hands warmly with state and church dignitaries , including polish president lech kaczynski , cardinal primate jozef glemp and archbishop of krakow stanislaw dziwisz .
a military band stood to attention . " i am happy to be here , among you , on the soil of the polish republic , " he said .
" i so wanted to visit the country of my beloved predecessor , the servant of god john paul ii , and to be here , among his country people . " kaczynski , in a nod to often turbulent polish-german relations in the past , welcomed the pope and spoke of spiritual reconciliation . " providence has deemed that a german has succeeded a pole on the throne of saint peter , " he said .
" our two peoples , who are very close , have often been separated by history .
today we feel that true reconciliation can only be achieved on a spiritual dimension . " " long live the pope " after the official welcome , benedict set off in a motorcade , bound for st. john 's cathedral in the centre of warsaw , to meet with members of the clergy . thousands of poles lined the streets of the capital to welcome the pope .
some cried , in polish , " long live the pope , " others held aloft the yellow and white flag of the vatican , letting it flutter in the brisk spring breeze . after passing through the old town , carefully rebuilt after it was completely destroyed in world war ii , the papal motorcade drove past the monument to the victims of the warsaw ghetto , where poland 's nazi occupiers isolated the capital 's thriving pre-war jewish community . but to the disappointment of the crowd gathered there , it neither slowed nor stopped to allow the pontiff to descend and pay tribute to the jews who were terrorized in wartime warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : native son john paul ii is still mourned in his homeland the pope also passed in front of a monument to poles deported and killed in the former soviet union , and one to the tragic 1944 warsaw uprising against the germans . the city was almost entirely destroyed in the closing phases of world war ii , and the country 's jewish population of around 3.5 million obliterated . like most german boys , benedict was enrolled into the hitler youth , but he took no part in fighting and later deserted the army . going to auschwitz as a catholic the first day of the papal visit was to be devoted mainly to meetings with polish officials and members of the clergy . on friday , benedict xvi will lead a huge open-air mass in warsaw 's central pilsudski square , which is expected to draw around one million faithful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will visit auschwitz as a " catholic , not a german " in his speech at the airport , benedict spoke in italian about the rest of his itinerary after warsaw , which will take him south to key sites in the life and papacy of john paul ii , culminating sunday at the nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau . " i hope to meet there survivors , the victims of nazi terror , from the many nations which suffered this tragic oppression , " benedict said .
" we will pray together that the wounds of the past century are healed by the medicine of god , who calls on us to forgive each other and offers us the mystery of the divine mercy . " on the flight to poland , benedict had told reporters that he was going to auschwitz " first and foremost as a catholic , " not as a german . " it is very important to understand that we are catholics and catholicism embraces all nationalities , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland prepares songs and prayers for pope 's visit poland put the finishing touches on preparations for the visit of pope benedict xvi , as people in the overwhelmingly catholic country focused on their spiritual readiness to welcome the german pontiff .
-lrb- may 25 , 2006 -rrb- poles like pope , origins and all only three percent of poles feel pope benedict xvi 's german origins pose a problem , with an overwhelming 80 percent saying they are not bothered by the pontiff 's nationality , a new poll shows .
-lrb- may 23 , 2006 -rrb- pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler . "
now , some critics have changed their tune .

" if merkel says she wo n't do 7.5 euros , well then we 'll do 7.55 euros , " dgb leader michael sommer said in response thursday .
although germany has no national minimum wage , there are agreements within various sectors between unions and management which fix basic levels . however , the dgb estimates that some 2.5 million people are working for an hourly wage of between 3.5 and four euros . unions want the elimimation of low wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer says he will not back down sommer had already said late wednesday that merkel 's proposal to top up the pay of under-paid workers " wo n't improve anything " and what was needed was an across-the-board elimination of low wages . merkel was booed and whistled at the congress when she called for a reform in the way workers ' representatives have a large say in how some big companies are run , notably in the key steel and chemicals industries . over the cacophony that met her speech , merkel struggled to be heard .
" i want strong unions .
i want a strong dgb , " merkel said .
" but the dgb , just like any other group , party or organisation , has to ask itself whether the answers of the past are still valid today . " müntefering jeered for defending merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the spd can not rely on union support the same treatment was afforded germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering when he appeared in front of the labor unions in an attempt to defend merkel and her government 's controversial policies on pensions and wages . despite the links between the unions and müntefering 's social democrats , the vice chancellor , who is also the labor minister , was heckled while trying to explain the government 's opposition to a minimum wage of 7.5 euros per hour and the decision to raise the retirement age to 67 from 65 in the coming years . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : unions demand much , yet lack vision may 1 is labor day in europe .

" over recent years , we 've sensed an east wind rising .
the 2006 selection confirms it , " fremaux said . a vintage year this promises to be a vintage year for a number of eastern european countries . " we 've not had so many films in cannes for 20 years , so it 's an exceptional year for us , " the hungarian industry 's csaba zoltan papp told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish director roman polanski won the palme d 'or four years ago for his film " the pianist " poland and romania , which has a stand here for the first time , are also both strongly represented in the lower-key , but still prestigious , ancillary events held alongside the competition for the coveted palme d 'or . the region has always produced some outstanding prize-winning filmmakers including poland 's krzystof kieslowski whose three-part " red , " " white " and " blue " film series won him fans around the world . serbia 's emir kusturica has the distinction of having scooped the top cannes honors on two occasions - in 1985 , with " when father was away on business " and again in 1995 with his film " underground . " the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child . " taxidermia " by young hungarian director gyorgy palfy has already been sold internationally after creating a box office sensation at home with its lurid scenes of feasting , drunkeness and debauchery . mood buoyant there is also a wide choice of promising films outside the " un certain regard " event . young hungarian director , agnes kocsis , who is fresh out of film school , is attracting a lot of attention .
she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

business confidence in germany steadied at a high level in april , after topping a 15-year high the previous month , a new survey showed wednesday , underlining the ongoing recovery of europe 's biggest economy . results better than expected the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the munich-based economic research institute ifo , slipped only fractionally , to 105.6 points in may from a 15-year high of 105.9 points in april , ifo said . analysts had been expecting a steeper decline .
consensus forecasts had penciled in a reading of 105.2 points this month . " overall , this is a very healthy survey , confirming germany 's recovery story , " said audrey childe-freeman , an economist for the canadian imperial bank of commerce in london . calyon economist mitul kotecha said the smaller than expected drop in the index " will help the euro to sustain its gains and will do little to dissuade many in the market who look for the ecb to hike by 50 basis points next month .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit . " we believe we can send from this summit good , positive , constructive messages regarding energy -lrb- and -rrb- about the need for a transparent and reciprocal cooperation in terms of energy , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . president putin was even more vague .
" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb . " we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier . " for president putin it will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the group of eight , " kommersant daily wrote thursday .
" the russian president will talk with eu leaders about energy security and try to stay away from the democracy subject . " he may find avoiding this embarrassing issue more difficult than he thought .
the european delegation made it clear that the issue of democracy in russia was one that they wished to address in depth in the future . " we do think that russia has a special responsibility to take forward questions like human rights , rule of law , good governance - all these basic values we in the european union hold up , " ferrero-waldner told reporters . " so we shall certainly mention that in our discussions .

this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit . " we believe we can send from this summit good , positive , constructive messages regarding energy -lrb- and -rrb- about the need for a transparent and reciprocal cooperation in terms of energy , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . president putin was even more vague .
" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb . " we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier . " for president putin it will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the group of eight , " kommersant daily wrote thursday .
" the russian president will talk with eu leaders about energy security and try to stay away from the democracy subject . " he may find avoiding this embarrassing issue more difficult than he thought .
the european delegation made it clear that the issue of democracy in russia was one that they wished to address in depth in the future . " we do think that russia has a special responsibility to take forward questions like human rights , rule of law , good governance - all these basic values we in the european union hold up , " ferrero-waldner told reporters .

" energy security will be high on the list of subjects , " said vladimir shizhov , russia 's ambassador to brussels , ahead of around three hours of eu-russia talks in the resort city of sochi . since the russia-ukraine gas crisis in january , when gazprom turned off the taps in a price war and hit supplies being piped through to western europe , concerns about energy security have spiraled into a war of words . the eu , the world 's second largest energy market and which imports about 20 percent of its natural gas needs from russia , wants reassurances that the problem will not be repeated in the future . but with brussels , on a widespread drive to boost competition , also expressing concern about gazprom 's monopoly position , russia wants reassurances of continuing demand for its resources in 10 or 20 years . eu plan to limit russian dependence irking putin " we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said last month .
" what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets . " " when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " he said . the russia-ukraine gas crisis , coupled with the heightened rhetoric , exposed gaping weaknesses in eu energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence that natural resources can have on foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants to secure russian energy for the eu analysts say it also revealed a newfound confidence in moscow under putin , who will meet thursday with european commission head jose manuel barroso , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . " they 've been saying all this for years .
what is different is that they are now saying it in a loud voice , " said dov lynch , head of eu-russia relations at the eu institute of security studies . " what has changed is that the eu has become conscious of how urgent the energy security problem is and the rise in confidence in russia on this issue , " he said . officials in brussels believe that energy issues could be included from next year in the eu-russia partnership , created in 1996 and currently being renegotiated . europeans want transparency , competition , reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears a repeat of gazprom 's show of strength in ukraine but the eu 's spokeswoman on external relations , emma udwin , said europe 's concerns about the gazprom monopoly will have to be taken into account .
" we are underlining that if a deeper energy partnership is going to be part of this new agreement , it should be governed by the same kind of principles that govern our economic partnership , " she told reporters on tuesday . " it means transparency , it means competition and it means reciprocity . " " this is a two-way street .
it is true that russia is a very , very important supplier for the eu ... but it is also the case that we are not just a customer for russia , we are at the present time the customer for russia , " she said . apart from laying the cornerstones for their new partnership agreement , the only concrete development that is likely in sochi is the signing of an accord easing visa requirements between brussels and moscow . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

business confidence in germany steadied at a high level in april , after topping a 15-year high the previous month , a new survey showed wednesday , underlining the ongoing recovery of europe 's biggest economy . results better than expected the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the munich-based economic research institute ifo , slipped only fractionally , to 105.6 points in may from a 15-year high of 105.9 points in april , ifo said . analysts had been expecting a steeper decline .
consensus forecasts had penciled in a reading of 105.2 points this month . " overall , this is a very healthy survey , confirming germany 's recovery story , " said audrey childe-freeman , an economist for the canadian imperial bank of commerce in london . calyon economist mitul kotecha said the smaller than expected drop in the index " will help the euro to sustain its gains and will do little to dissuade many in the market who look for the ecb to hike by 50 basis points next month . " most analysts believe the european central bank will lift eurozone interest rates to 2.75 percent on june 8 , from the current 2.50 percent . commenting on the business-climate survey , ifo board member gebhard flaig said : " the almost unchanged reading results from two divergent trends - companies are more positive in their assessment of their current business situation .
but they 've become slightly more cautious with regard to the outlook for the next six months .

" over recent years , we 've sensed an east wind rising .
the 2006 selection confirms it , " fremaux said . a vintage year this promises to be a vintage year for a number of eastern european countries .

" the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child . " taxidermia " by young hungarian director gyorgy palfy has already been sold internationally after creating a box office sensation at home with its lurid scenes of feasting , drunkeness and debauchery . mood buoyant there is also a wide choice of promising films outside the " un certain regard " event . young hungarian director , agnes kocsis , who is fresh out of film school , is attracting a lot of attention .
she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

" over recent years , we 've sensed an east wind rising .
the 2006 selection confirms it , " fremaux said . a vintage year this promises to be a vintage year for a number of eastern european countries . " we 've not had so many films in cannes for 20 years , so it 's an exceptional year for us , " the hungarian industry 's csaba zoltan papp told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish director roman polanski won the palme d 'or four years ago for his film " the pianist " poland and romania , which has a stand here for the first time , are also both strongly represented in the lower-key , but still prestigious , ancillary events held alongside the competition for the coveted palme d 'or . the region has always produced some outstanding prize-winning filmmakers including poland 's krzystof kieslowski whose three-part " red , " " white " and " blue " film series won him fans around the world . serbia 's emir kusturica has the distinction of having scooped the top cannes honors on two occasions - in 1985 , with " when father was away on business " and again in 1995 with his film " underground . " the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child . " taxidermia " by young hungarian director gyorgy palfy has already been sold internationally after creating a box office sensation at home with its lurid scenes of feasting , drunkeness and debauchery . mood buoyant there is also a wide choice of promising films outside the " un certain regard " event . young hungarian director , agnes kocsis , who is fresh out of film school , is attracting a lot of attention .
she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

" if merkel says she wo n't do 7.5 euros , well then we 'll do 7.55 euros , " dgb leader michael sommer said in response thursday .
although germany has no national minimum wage , there are agreements within various sectors between unions and management which fix basic levels . however , the dgb estimates that some 2.5 million people are working for an hourly wage of between 3.5 and four euros . unions want the elimimation of low wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer says he will not back down sommer had already said late wednesday that merkel 's proposal to top up the pay of under-paid workers " wo n't improve anything " and what was needed was an across-the-board elimination of low wages . merkel was booed and whistled at the congress when she called for a reform in the way workers ' representatives have a large say in how some big companies are run , notably in the key steel and chemicals industries . over the cacophony that met her speech , merkel struggled to be heard .
" i want strong unions .
i want a strong dgb , " merkel said .
" but the dgb , just like any other group , party or organisation , has to ask itself whether the answers of the past are still valid today . " müntefering jeered for defending merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and the spd can not rely on union support the same treatment was afforded germany 's vice chancellor franz müntefering when he appeared in front of the labor unions in an attempt to defend merkel and her government 's controversial policies on pensions and wages . despite the links between the unions and müntefering 's social democrats , the vice chancellor , who is also the labor minister , was heckled while trying to explain the government 's opposition to a minimum wage of 7.5 euros per hour and the decision to raise the retirement age to 67 from 65 in the coming years . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : unions demand much , yet lack vision may 1 is labor day in europe .

" they will make visas simpler , easier to obtain and also step up the fight against illegal immigration , " benita ferrero-waldner , the eu 's commissioner for external relations , said eu leaders met with russian president vladimir putin hoping to obtain guarantees on europe 's energy security and join forces with moscow to keep iran 's nuclear ambitions in check . " a strong energy partnership is in both our interests .
this requires security and predictability on both sides , " ferrero-waldner said thursday ahead of the summit . putin was hosting ferrero-waldner , european commission president jose manuel barroso and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , current holder of the eu presidency , in sochi on the palm-fringed black sea coast of southwestern russia . at the start of the one-day summit , putin said russia was taking measures to " strengthen the energy security of the european continent " with the aim of " improving the quality of life of europeans . " eu , russia still divided over energy issues but russia , which has the biggest gas reserves in the world and accounts for 26 percent of eu gas supplies , and europe are still divided over access to each other 's energy markets and accuse each other of politicizing the issue . however both sides tried to put a diplomatuic face on the fact that the really hard bargaining had yet to be addressed at the summit . " we believe we can send from this summit good , positive , constructive messages regarding energy -lrb- and -rrb- about the need for a transparent and reciprocal cooperation in terms of energy , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . president putin was even more vague .
" russia sees the european union as its key international partner , " he said , adding construction of the north european pipeline was one example of its commitment to ensure the energy security of the continent . the energy issue has soured east-west relations much of this year , ever since russian gas giant gazprom briefly switched off the taps to ukraine during a price dispute in january , hitting supplies further west in europe . the european union now wants energy issues to be included in a new eu-russia partnership agreement from next year to replace a deal signed in 1996 . initial talks on a new document are set to start at the summit . " the time has come to agree on the foundation stones for a new agreement to reflect the full range of cooperation , " barroso said in a written statement this week . common ground on iran even as differences remain over energy , brussels and moscow stressed common ground on stopping a determined iran from pushing ahead with uranium enrichment - seen in the west as part of a secret plan to build a nuclear bomb . " we will think how we can find a way out of this complex situation together , " sergei yastrzhembsky , putin 's envoy to the european union , told reporters ahead of talks . ferrero-waldner recognized russia was " a very constructive player " in the diplomatic stand-off over iran and stressed " synergy " between russia and the european union . " at the same time , we also have to have credible alternatives that are still being discussed in the security council , " in case iran rejects offers aimed at coaxing it into stopping sensitive nuclear work , ferrero-waldner said . putin expected to steer clear of awkward democracy questions analysts say the meeting is a chance for putin to smoothen rough diplomatic waters ahead of the g8 summit he hosts in july , amid us criticism about the state of democracy in russia and widespread western fears about moscow 's reliability as an energy supplier . " for president putin it will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the group of eight , " kommersant daily wrote thursday .
" the russian president will talk with eu leaders about energy security and try to stay away from the democracy subject . " he may find avoiding this embarrassing issue more difficult than he thought .
the european delegation made it clear that the issue of democracy in russia was one that they wished to address in depth in the future . " we do think that russia has a special responsibility to take forward questions like human rights , rule of law , good governance - all these basic values we in the european union hold up , " ferrero-waldner told reporters . " so we shall certainly mention that in our discussions . " russian and eu officials meeting in sochi also agreed in principle on a 20-million euro aid program for the troubled north caucasus region that includes chechnya , ferrero-waldner said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and russia meet in shadow of energy war of words russian president vladimir putin meets senior european union officials on thursday for a black sea summit marked by tensions over the security of natural gas supplied by the energy giant gazprom .

" energy security will be high on the list of subjects , " said vladimir shizhov , russia 's ambassador to brussels , ahead of around three hours of eu-russia talks in the resort city of sochi . since the russia-ukraine gas crisis in january , when gazprom turned off the taps in a price war and hit supplies being piped through to western europe , concerns about energy security have spiraled into a war of words . the eu , the world 's second largest energy market and which imports about 20 percent of its natural gas needs from russia , wants reassurances that the problem will not be repeated in the future . but with brussels , on a widespread drive to boost competition , also expressing concern about gazprom 's monopoly position , russia wants reassurances of continuing demand for its resources in 10 or 20 years . eu plan to limit russian dependence irking putin " we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said last month .
" what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets . " " when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " he said . the russia-ukraine gas crisis , coupled with the heightened rhetoric , exposed gaping weaknesses in eu energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence that natural resources can have on foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants to secure russian energy for the eu analysts say it also revealed a newfound confidence in moscow under putin , who will meet thursday with european commission head jose manuel barroso , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel . " they 've been saying all this for years .
what is different is that they are now saying it in a loud voice , " said dov lynch , head of eu-russia relations at the eu institute of security studies . " what has changed is that the eu has become conscious of how urgent the energy security problem is and the rise in confidence in russia on this issue , " he said . officials in brussels believe that energy issues could be included from next year in the eu-russia partnership , created in 1996 and currently being renegotiated . europeans want transparency , competition , reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears a repeat of gazprom 's show of strength in ukraine but the eu 's spokeswoman on external relations , emma udwin , said europe 's concerns about the gazprom monopoly will have to be taken into account .
" we are underlining that if a deeper energy partnership is going to be part of this new agreement , it should be governed by the same kind of principles that govern our economic partnership , " she told reporters on tuesday . " it means transparency , it means competition and it means reciprocity . " " this is a two-way street .
it is true that russia is a very , very important supplier for the eu ... but it is also the case that we are not just a customer for russia , we are at the present time the customer for russia , " she said . apart from laying the cornerstones for their new partnership agreement , the only concrete development that is likely in sochi is the signing of an accord easing visa requirements between brussels and moscow . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline .

" he called for restraint in making " facile accusations in the absence of real proof " and for those who stand accused to show " humble sincerity and not to deny the sins of the past . " a week before the pope 's arrival in poland , polish priest michal czajkowski , who is known in his native land for his work in reconciling christians and jews , was accused in a press report of having been a communist agent for 24 years . " the country of my beloved predecessor " " i have come to follow in the footsteps of john paul ii , along the path of his life , " benedict said in polish to cheers from the crowd of airport staff and dignitaries who were on hand to greet him .
" this is not just a sentimental journey , but a journey of faith .

" our two peoples , who are very close , have often been separated by history .
today we feel that true reconciliation can only be achieved on a spiritual dimension . " " long live the pope " after the official welcome , benedict set off in a motorcade , bound for st. john 's cathedral in the centre of warsaw , to meet with members of the clergy . thousands of poles lined the streets of the capital to welcome the pope .
some cried , in polish , " long live the pope , " others held aloft the yellow and white flag of the vatican , letting it flutter in the brisk spring breeze . after passing through the old town , carefully rebuilt after it was completely destroyed in world war ii , the papal motorcade drove past the monument to the victims of the warsaw ghetto , where poland 's nazi occupiers isolated the capital 's thriving pre-war jewish community . but to the disappointment of the crowd gathered there , it neither slowed nor stopped to allow the pontiff to descend and pay tribute to the jews who were terrorized in wartime warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : native son john paul ii is still mourned in his homeland the pope also passed in front of a monument to poles deported and killed in the former soviet union , and one to the tragic 1944 warsaw uprising against the germans . the city was almost entirely destroyed in the closing phases of world war ii , and the country 's jewish population of around 3.5 million obliterated . like most german boys , benedict was enrolled into the hitler youth , but he took no part in fighting and later deserted the army . going to auschwitz as a catholic the first day of the papal visit was to be devoted mainly to meetings with polish officials and members of the clergy . on friday , benedict xvi will lead a huge open-air mass in warsaw 's central pilsudski square , which is expected to draw around one million faithful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will visit auschwitz as a " catholic , not a german " in his speech at the airport , benedict spoke in italian about the rest of his itinerary after warsaw , which will take him south to key sites in the life and papacy of john paul ii , culminating sunday at the nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau . " i hope to meet there survivors , the victims of nazi terror , from the many nations which suffered this tragic oppression , " benedict said .
" we will pray together that the wounds of the past century are healed by the medicine of god , who calls on us to forgive each other and offers us the mystery of the divine mercy . " on the flight to poland , benedict had told reporters that he was going to auschwitz " first and foremost as a catholic , " not as a german .

" he called for restraint in making " facile accusations in the absence of real proof " and for those who stand accused to show " humble sincerity and not to deny the sins of the past . " a week before the pope 's arrival in poland , polish priest michal czajkowski , who is known in his native land for his work in reconciling christians and jews , was accused in a press report of having been a communist agent for 24 years . " the country of my beloved predecessor " " i have come to follow in the footsteps of john paul ii , along the path of his life , " benedict said in polish to cheers from the crowd of airport staff and dignitaries who were on hand to greet him .
" this is not just a sentimental journey , but a journey of faith . " " i want to drink at the abundant spring of your faith , which has flowed incessantly for more than a millennium , " he added . benedict 's alitalia flight from rome touched down at warsaw 's okecie airport shortly before 11:00 a.m.
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles have been eagerly awaiting the pontiff a blustery wind ruffled his white papal cloak as he descended the steps of the plane to hymns entoned by a choir of airport employees . gusts of wind bore the sound of tolling church bells while benedict shook hands warmly with state and church dignitaries , including polish president lech kaczynski , cardinal primate jozef glemp and archbishop of krakow stanislaw dziwisz .
a military band stood to attention . " i am happy to be here , among you , on the soil of the polish republic , " he said .
" i so wanted to visit the country of my beloved predecessor , the servant of god john paul ii , and to be here , among his country people . " kaczynski , in a nod to often turbulent polish-german relations in the past , welcomed the pope and spoke of spiritual reconciliation . " providence has deemed that a german has succeeded a pole on the throne of saint peter , " he said .
" our two peoples , who are very close , have often been separated by history .
today we feel that true reconciliation can only be achieved on a spiritual dimension . " " long live the pope " after the official welcome , benedict set off in a motorcade , bound for st. john 's cathedral in the centre of warsaw , to meet with members of the clergy . thousands of poles lined the streets of the capital to welcome the pope .
some cried , in polish , " long live the pope , " others held aloft the yellow and white flag of the vatican , letting it flutter in the brisk spring breeze . after passing through the old town , carefully rebuilt after it was completely destroyed in world war ii , the papal motorcade drove past the monument to the victims of the warsaw ghetto , where poland 's nazi occupiers isolated the capital 's thriving pre-war jewish community . but to the disappointment of the crowd gathered there , it neither slowed nor stopped to allow the pontiff to descend and pay tribute to the jews who were terrorized in wartime warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : native son john paul ii is still mourned in his homeland the pope also passed in front of a monument to poles deported and killed in the former soviet union , and one to the tragic 1944 warsaw uprising against the germans . the city was almost entirely destroyed in the closing phases of world war ii , and the country 's jewish population of around 3.5 million obliterated . like most german boys , benedict was enrolled into the hitler youth , but he took no part in fighting and later deserted the army . going to auschwitz as a catholic the first day of the papal visit was to be devoted mainly to meetings with polish officials and members of the clergy . on friday , benedict xvi will lead a huge open-air mass in warsaw 's central pilsudski square , which is expected to draw around one million faithful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will visit auschwitz as a " catholic , not a german " in his speech at the airport , benedict spoke in italian about the rest of his itinerary after warsaw , which will take him south to key sites in the life and papacy of john paul ii , culminating sunday at the nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau . " i hope to meet there survivors , the victims of nazi terror , from the many nations which suffered this tragic oppression , " benedict said .
" we will pray together that the wounds of the past century are healed by the medicine of god , who calls on us to forgive each other and offers us the mystery of the divine mercy . " on the flight to poland , benedict had told reporters that he was going to auschwitz " first and foremost as a catholic , " not as a german . " it is very important to understand that we are catholics and catholicism embraces all nationalities , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland prepares songs and prayers for pope 's visit poland put the finishing touches on preparations for the visit of pope benedict xvi , as people in the overwhelmingly catholic country focused on their spiritual readiness to welcome the german pontiff .

" if we had written the whole names , it would certainly have become expensive for us .
however , it is not forbidden to shorten the names .

" over recent years , we 've sensed an east wind rising .
the 2006 selection confirms it , " fremaux said . a vintage year this promises to be a vintage year for a number of eastern european countries . " we 've not had so many films in cannes for 20 years , so it 's an exceptional year for us , " the hungarian industry 's csaba zoltan papp told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish director roman polanski won the palme d 'or four years ago for his film " the pianist " poland and romania , which has a stand here for the first time , are also both strongly represented in the lower-key , but still prestigious , ancillary events held alongside the competition for the coveted palme d 'or . the region has always produced some outstanding prize-winning filmmakers including poland 's krzystof kieslowski whose three-part " red , " " white " and " blue " film series won him fans around the world . serbia 's emir kusturica has the distinction of having scooped the top cannes honors on two occasions - in 1985 , with " when father was away on business " and again in 1995 with his film " underground . " the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child . " taxidermia " by young hungarian director gyorgy palfy has already been sold internationally after creating a box office sensation at home with its lurid scenes of feasting , drunkeness and debauchery . mood buoyant there is also a wide choice of promising films outside the " un certain regard " event . young hungarian director , agnes kocsis , who is fresh out of film school , is attracting a lot of attention .
she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

" over recent years , we 've sensed an east wind rising .
the 2006 selection confirms it , " fremaux said . a vintage year this promises to be a vintage year for a number of eastern european countries . " we 've not had so many films in cannes for 20 years , so it 's an exceptional year for us , " the hungarian industry 's csaba zoltan papp told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish director roman polanski won the palme d 'or four years ago for his film " the pianist " poland and romania , which has a stand here for the first time , are also both strongly represented in the lower-key , but still prestigious , ancillary events held alongside the competition for the coveted palme d 'or . the region has always produced some outstanding prize-winning filmmakers including poland 's krzystof kieslowski whose three-part " red , " " white " and " blue " film series won him fans around the world . serbia 's emir kusturica has the distinction of having scooped the top cannes honors on two occasions - in 1985 , with " when father was away on business " and again in 1995 with his film " underground . " the first kosovan film producer at cannes but the number of filmmakers achieving international recognition has remained small , mostly as a result of a lack of state subsidies as well as political upheaval in some countries . the tide appears of have turned , however , if the number of countries turning out at this year 's cannes festival to promote their fast expanding range of high-quality movies is any indication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval " is competing the " un certain regard " category such is the growing importance of the film industry to the countries ' economies that bosnia-hercegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , serbia , slovakia and slovenia have all turned up to share or host their own pavilions at the festival , despite the high cost . even tiny kosovo is represented by nehat fejza of concordia pictures . " this is my first ever year at cannes and i am the first ever kosovo film producer to participate here , " fejza said . fejza , who has a couple co-productions under way - " tonight has been cancelled " with ireland and " power cuts " with a german partner - said the festival was proving a great place to learn and network . no palme d 'or - this time although no eastern european film is in the running for the palme d 'or , the region is well placed to scoop top honors in the " un certain regard " competition , the festival 's top sidebar event . after winning " un certain regard " last year with cristi puiv 's " the death of mr. lazarescu " , romania is again in the race with catalin mitulescu 's " the way i spent the end of the world . " but " it will be difficult to win a prize for the second year running , " noted romania 's laorentio bratar , here to promote the country 's wide range of films . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some film makers such as slawomir fabicki of poland are attending cannes for the first time poland will also be putting up stiff competition with slawomir fabicki 's debut film " retrieval , " a hard-hitting story of a 19-year-old who is forced to enter a world of evil to protect the woman in his life and her child . " taxidermia " by young hungarian director gyorgy palfy has already been sold internationally after creating a box office sensation at home with its lurid scenes of feasting , drunkeness and debauchery . mood buoyant there is also a wide choice of promising films outside the " un certain regard " event . young hungarian director , agnes kocsis , who is fresh out of film school , is attracting a lot of attention .
she has two movies in official screenings here this festival . her short movie , " the virus " , is screening as part of " cinefondation " that introduces work by film students , while her first feature film , " fresh air " , is being presented in critics week . with so many films being presented to the world 's top movie critics and industry buyers , the mood on the balkan and eastern european pavilions was buoyant . and with all eastern european countries competing to offer tax incentives to attract more film production business while also supporting their blossoming national film industries , it is proving to be a great time to be in movies in the east of europe . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : european films make a big splash at cannes at this year 's cannes film festival , european cinema is dominating hollywood and bollywood .

julia donaldson , whose books include the multi-million selling the gruffalo , has written a series of 36 books which aim to introduce children to reading .
the glasgow-based author said she had long been interested in phonics .
she said that when she was just six years old she taught her younger sister by sounding out the letters of words .
phonics is a method of teaching children to read and pronounce words by learning the sound of letters , letter groups and syllables .
the emphasis is on decoding words from the vowel and consonant sounds rather than " sight vocabulary " where a whole word is learned . "
gradually you introduce more letters until they have learnt all the short vowel sounds and all the consonants " julia donaldson what do you think of phonics ?
send us your views donaldson , 57 , said that when her own children , who are now adults , were at school , she was concerned that there did not seem to be enough flexibility in the way they were taught .
she said : " at that stage people seemed to be taught very much by the ' look and say ' method , where you look at any word - telephone , table , that - and learned to recognise it .
" this is fine for a lot of children but for some it is ' look and guess ' , and as soon as you remove the pictures , then they actually ca n't read .
" i 've long felt that you need a variety of approaches and that there were not really enough phonics books . "
sound recognition she said that she was approached to write the songbirds series for the oxford reading tree scheme because her books such as the gruffalo , room on the broom and a squash and a squeeze , are widely used in schools .
" they are used to help teach reading , sound recognition , letter patterns and so on , " she said .
of the 40 or so books she has written since her first work was published in 1993 , there are a significant number of " rhyme " books , which were described by fellow author michael rosen as " metrical perfection " .
donaldson said that writing books which had a strict but simple rhyme , yet still managed to tell an absorbing tale , was a very tough discipline .
even though she is used to working within such confines she describes trying to write the phonics books as " like doing a crossword puzzle or a sudoku " .
the first book in the series , top cat , only uses two vowel sounds and eight consonants .
" gradually you introduce more letters until they have learnt all the short vowel sounds and all the consonants , " she said .
it is only in the second half of the series that long vowel sounds are introduced , opening up more possibilities for rhyme and story telling .
donaldson 's foray into phonics has led to her being described as britain 's answer to dr seuss .
she said that she could see why the comparison would be made in relation to her phonics books .
the american author of books such as the cat in the hat was very much thinking of how children would read his books .
although outside her work in phonics , donaldson would prefer to be compared to edward lear and lewis carroll .
her books are published at a time when the teaching of phonics has become a political issue .
intensive period it is now an accepted part of the government 's recommended approach to teaching literacy but there are disagreements about how it should be taught .
an experiment with synthetic phonics in clackmannanshire has reported strong gains .
it found that children taught this way were seven months ahead at the end of their second year at school .
advocates of synthetic phonics believe that children should have an intensive period of learning letter-combination sounds before they are introduced to books .
many teachers think it does not suit all children 's learning styles and argue it is so mechanistic it can destroy the joy of reading .
sue ellis , a reader in childhood and primary studies at strathclyde university , said : " you need to make sure children are getting a rich language background , with books that are interesting , meaningful and enjoyable and that they want to read . "
ms ellis agreed that phonics should be taught " fast and early " but said that children also needed a good " sight vocabulary " so that they could recognise words that were not phonically regular .
she said that one problem with phonics book was that they required a very skilful writer to make them " rich " enough to engage young children .
there was always going to be a limited number of books available , she said .
ms ellis said that children needed to be taught to monitor their comprehension so that they noticed when they no longer understood what was happening .
" if you have a book that does n't have a strong story , that comprehension monitoring becomes problematic .
" all systems for teaching reading have advantages and disadvantages .
" all systems produce casualties , they just produce different types of casualty . "
children 's programmes donaldson said she did not want to be seen as a " phonics fanatic " .
she said that phonics should be " at the core of teaching children to read " but thought a mixed approach to teaching was most suited to the different ways in which children learn .
later this year donaldson , who for many years wrote and performed songs for children 's programmes such as playaway , is to set off around the world entertaining in theatres .
her tour begins at the edinburgh festival in august before taking in oxford , brighton and london .
she will then head off with her gp husband , dubbed dr gruffalo in the medical press , for bermuda , chile , australia , new zealand and hong kong .
since publication of the gruffalo in 1999 it has sold more than two million copies and been translated into 34 languages .

julia donaldson , whose books include the multi-million selling the gruffalo , has written a series of 36 books which aim to introduce children to reading .
the glasgow-based author said she had long been interested in phonics .
she said that when she was just six years old she taught her younger sister by sounding out the letters of words .
phonics is a method of teaching children to read and pronounce words by learning the sound of letters , letter groups and syllables .
the emphasis is on decoding words from the vowel and consonant sounds rather than " sight vocabulary " where a whole word is learned .
gradually you introduce more letters until they have learnt all the short vowel sounds and all the consonants julia donaldson what do you think of phonics ?
send us your views donaldson , 57 , said that when her own children , who are now adults , were at school , she was concerned that there did not seem to be enough flexibility in the way they were taught .
she said : " at that stage people seemed to be taught very much by the ' look and say ' method , where you look at any word - telephone , table , that - and learned to recognise it .
" this is fine for a lot of children but for some it is ' look and guess ' , and as soon as you remove the pictures , then they actually ca n't read .
" i 've long felt that you need a variety of approaches and that there were not really enough phonics books . "
sound recognition she said that she was approached to write the songbirds series for the oxford reading tree scheme because her books such as the gruffalo , room on the broom and a squash and a squeeze , are widely used in schools .
" they are used to help teach reading , sound recognition , letter patterns and so on , " she said .
of the 40 or so books she has written since her first work was published in 1993 , there are a significant number of " rhyme " books , which were described by fellow author michael rosen as " metrical perfection " .
donaldson said that writing books which had a strict but simple rhyme , yet still managed to tell an absorbing tale , was a very tough discipline .
even though she is used to working within such confines she describes trying to write the phonics books as " like doing a crossword puzzle or a sudoku " .
phonics is an accepted part of teaching reading the first book in the series , top cat , only uses two vowel sounds and eight consonants .
" gradually you introduce more letters until they have learnt all the short vowel sounds and all the consonants , " she said .
it is only in the second half of the series that long vowel sounds are introduced , opening up more possibilities for rhyme and story telling .
donaldson 's foray into phonics has led to her being described as britain 's answer to dr seuss .
she said that she could see why the comparison would be made in relation to her phonics books .
the american author of books such as the cat in the hat was very much thinking of how children would read his books .
although outside her work in phonics , donaldson would prefer to be compared to edward lear and lewis carroll .
her books are published at a time when the teaching of phonics has become a political issue .
intensive period it is now an accepted part of the government 's recommended approach to teaching literacy but there are disagreements about how it should be taught .
an experiment with synthetic phonics in clackmannanshire has reported strong gains .
it found that children taught this way were seven months ahead at the end of their second year at school .
advocates of synthetic phonics believe that children should have an intensive period of learning letter-combination sounds before they are introduced to books .
many teachers think it does not suit all children 's learning styles and argue it is so mechanistic it can destroy the joy of reading .
sue ellis , a reader in childhood and primary studies at strathclyde university , said : " you need to make sure children are getting a rich language background , with books that are interesting , meaningful and enjoyable and that they want to read . "
ms ellis agreed that phonics should be taught " fast and early " but said that children also needed a good " sight vocabulary " so that they could recognise words that were not phonically regular .
julia donaldson 's the gruffalo has sold more than two million copies she said that one problem with phonics book was that they required a very skilful writer to make them " rich " enough to engage young children .
there was always going to be a limited number of books available , she said .
ms ellis said that children needed to be taught to monitor their comprehension so that they noticed when they no longer understood what was happening .
" if you have a book that does n't have a strong story , that comprehension monitoring becomes problematic .
" all systems for teaching reading have advantages and disadvantages .
" all systems produce casualties , they just produce different types of casualty . "
children 's programmes donaldson said she did not want to be seen as a " phonics fanatic " .
she said that phonics should be " at the core of teaching children to read " but thought a mixed approach to teaching was most suited to the different ways in which children learn .
later this year donaldson , who for many years wrote and performed songs for children 's programmes such as playaway , is to set off around the world entertaining in theatres .
her tour begins at the edinburgh festival in august before taking in oxford , brighton and london .
she will then head off with her gp husband , dubbed dr gruffalo in the medical press , for bermuda , chile , australia , new zealand and hong kong .
since publication of the gruffalo in 1999 it has sold more than two million copies and been translated into 34 languages .

julia donaldson , whose books include the multi-million selling the gruffalo , has written a series of 36 books which aim to introduce children to reading .
the glasgow-based author said she had long been interested in phonics .
she said that when she was just six years old she taught her younger sister by sounding out the letters of words .
phonics is a method of teaching children to read and pronounce words by learning the sound of letters , letter groups and syllables .
the emphasis is on decoding words from the vowel and consonant sounds rather than " sight vocabulary " where a whole word is learned .
gradually you introduce more letters until they have learnt all the short vowel sounds and all the consonants julia donaldson what do you think of phonics ?
send us your views donaldson , 57 , said that when her own children , who are now adults , were at school , she was concerned that there did not seem to be enough flexibility in the way they were taught .
she said : " at that stage people seemed to be taught very much by the ' look and say ' method , where you look at any word - telephone , table , that - and learned to recognise it .
" this is fine for a lot of children but for some it is ' look and guess ' , and as soon as you remove the pictures , then they actually ca n't read .
" i 've long felt that you need a variety of approaches and that there were not really enough phonics books . "
sound recognition she said that she was approached to write the songbirds series for the oxford reading tree scheme because her books such as the gruffalo , room on the broom and a squash and a squeeze , are widely used in schools .
" they are used to help teach reading , sound recognition , letter patterns and so on , " she said .
of the 40 or so books she has written since her first work was published in 1993 , there are a significant number of " rhyme " books , which were described by fellow author michael rosen as " metrical perfection " .
donaldson said that writing books which had a strict but simple rhyme , yet still managed to tell an absorbing tale , was a very tough discipline .
even though she is used to working within such confines she describes trying to write the phonics books as " like doing a crossword puzzle or a sudoku " .
phonics is an accepted part of teaching reading the first book in the series , top cat , only uses two vowel sounds and eight consonants .
" gradually you introduce more letters until they have learnt all the short vowel sounds and all the consonants , " she said .
it is only in the second half of the series that long vowel sounds are introduced , opening up more possibilities for rhyme and story telling .
donaldson 's foray into phonics has led to her being described as britain 's answer to dr seuss .
she said that she could see why the comparison would be made in relation to her phonics books .
the american author of books such as the cat in the hat was very much thinking of how children would read his books .
although outside her work in phonics , donaldson would prefer to be compared to edward lear and lewis carroll .
her books are published at a time when the teaching of phonics has become a political issue .
intensive period it is now an accepted part of the government 's recommended approach to teaching literacy but there are disagreements about how it should be taught .
an experiment with synthetic phonics in clackmannanshire has reported strong gains .
it found that children taught this way were seven months ahead at the end of their second year at school .

during the last 25 years , numbers of the pearl-bordered fritillary have declined by 77 % , making it the second most endangered species in wales .
experts say numbers had dwindled because of changes in land management .
national trust staff have already worked on a project at cwm soden to help the butterfly survive .
the decline of the pearl-bordered fritillary comes second only to that of wales 's most endangered butterfly , the high brown fritillary .
the butterflies are a lovely orange colour , and they are quite visible as they tend to nectar along the footpaths russel hobson russel hobson , from butterfly conservation wales , said changes in the way woodlands are managed had contributed to the decline .
" the pearl-bordered fritillary is a species that occupies very flower rich bracken slopes , " he said .
" it used to be associated with woodland , but now there are none in woodlands in wales , they are all in big sunny open bracken slopes . "
mr hobson explained that the species used to flourish in " heavily-managed " woodland areas like the wye valley .
he said traditional methods for managing the woodland had created warm pockets within the woodland with lots of violets - the species ' favourite flower - to feed on .
' biggest impact ' the pearl-bordered fritillary also flourishes on bracken-covered slopes , but if the bracken becomes too dense , the violets are smothered .
mr hobson said grazing animals used to control the growth of the bracken , and the decline in cattle grazing on the slopes could also have contributed to the demise of the butterflies .
" it 's very difficult to tell why this species is at such low numbers , if it is the change in land management or grazing animals that has had the biggest impact , " he said .
" the work the national trust is doing is fantastic , because it is reversing the trend , " he added .
paul boland , the national trust 's property manager for ceredigion , said with support from the countryside council for wales they had been able to employ contractors and work with volunteers to manage the site .
staff at the site near cwmtudu rake off the dense build-up of bracken litter , which smothers the violets , that the butterflies ' caterpillars feed on .

during the last 25 years , numbers of the pearl-bordered fritillary have declined by 77 % , making it the second most endangered species in wales .
experts say numbers had dwindled because of changes in land management .
national trust staff have already worked on a project at cwm soden to help the butterfly survive .

for the year to 31 march 2006 , the japanese games console maker made an operating profit of 90bn yen -lrb- $ 799m ; £ 427m -rrb- , down from 112bn yen .
nintendo said profits for its current year should come in 3.5 % below existing market expectations .
it is due to launch its latest console , the wii , before key festive trading .
' dashed expectations ' the firm 's sales for the past financial year fell 1.2 % to 509bn yen , hit by falling demand for its outgoing gamecube console and supporting games .
strong sales of its ds handheld and titles such as nintendogs failed to make up for the shortfall .
it is planning to launch the wii console in the final quarter of the year , competing against microsoft 's xbox 360 and sony 's playstation 3 .
at a news conference in osaka , nintendo senior managing director yoshihiro mori said the wii would sell for 25,000 yen -lrb- $ 220 -rrb- or lower in japan and $ 250 -lrb- £ 133 -rrb- or lower in the us .
the japanese games giant said it aimed to sell six million consoles by march 2007 .
annual net profit rose 12.5 % to 98bn yen , but that was thanks in part to a large currency gain .
nintendo 's shares ended thursday trading down 8 % .
" i think the share price fall is really a case of expectations being high and investors selling after having seen what they came to see , " said tatsuo nishimura , portfolio manager at meiji dresdner asset management .

he 's excited and looking forward to moving in .
a normal reaction for someone who 's been some time on the waiting list but jeremy 's move goes against the established grain in oldham .
for he is a white man moving into the predominately asian area of glodwick .
overall four out of every ten of the 11,000 inhabitants in the ward of st mary 's , of which glodwick is part , are of pakistani or bangladeshi descent .
it 's rare to see a white face in glodwick road and even rarer in waterloo street at the heart of the glodwick district .
it will be the first time that jeremy has lived in an area of oldham where white people are not in the majority .
and he says a few years ago he would never have contemplated it , especially after the racially-motivated violence of may 2001 .
there 's more mixing going on than when i first moved here eight years ago , then it was definitely just whites on this street rachel brookbank divide ' remains ' after riots " i was n't keen on the area before but it 's quieter now , i 've got a flat here and it 's better than nothing , " he says .
but jeremy 's friend annette turner from failsworth , a largely white district of oldham , is adamant she would never venture into glodwick after dark .
" i wo n't come here at night because it 's just a no-go for whites .
the problems have never got better , there are still no-go areas , it 's unbelievable .
there are areas where whites ca n't go and they ca n't come into ours . "
' non-traditional areas ' such comments bring to mind the " parallel lives " described by ted cantle in his report for the home office on the causes of the racially-motivated violence in oldham and a string of northern towns and cities five years ago .
oldham residents air their views on racial integration in pictures just five miles away the saddleworth ward has a population which is 97 % white .
and even within glodwick there are few streets where white and asian people live side by side .
moves like jeremy heap 's are part of a policy by first choice homes , the company which manages oldham 's council 's housing stock , to encourage more integration .
equalities and cohesion manager uspar miah , says a lot of effort is put into supporting those who move into areas where they will be very much in the minority .
the policy is not just dictated by a desire to integrate communities but also by practicality and a dwindling stock of houses .
" what we found is the asian families require larger homes but larger homes tend to be in what are considered " non-traditional areas " for asian families - very strong indigenous white areas .
" and some of the smaller houses were in the asian areas .
so obviously that balance was something we had to redress . "
and he says , with the correct backing , those who move into " non-traditional " areas settle down well .
" in the last financial year we supported more than 140 families moving into what are classed as non-traditional areas .
out of those 140 only one person has n't stayed . "
there 's a lot of deprivation among the ethnic communities so it 's difficult for them to move councillor riaz ahmad local rachel brookbank agrees oldham is becoming more integrated .
she has seen changes in her area of glodwick .
" where i live there are mostly white families but there 's more mixing going on than when i first moved here eight years ago , then it was definitely just whites on this street , " she says .
' deprivation ' st mary 's councillor and former oldham mayor riaz ahmad - whose house was firebombed during the 2001 disturbances - backs the drive to create more racially-mixed areas .
efforts are being made to integrate oldham 's distinct communities mr ahmad says the predominance of asians in glodwick does not reflect a desire to remain separate from the white community .
" there 's a lot of deprivation among the ethnic communities so it 's difficult for them to move , even if they would like to move they ca n't afford to because they 're unemployed or on a low wage . "
mohammed ansar of glodwick 's pakistani community centre says that even after the troubles of 2001 , they still do not have the resources to deal with the deprivation in the area .
" i have not seen much improvement in facilities for ethnic minorities particularly youth facilities .
there are only two sessions per week of a youth club in the whole of glodwick and that 's an improvement as they had nothing before , " mr ansar says .
" so there are limitations , we need a lot more resources to serve the people around here efficiently and effectively , to really address their issues . "

he 's excited and looking forward to moving in .
a normal reaction for someone who 's been some time on the waiting list but jeremy 's move goes against the established grain in oldham .
for he is a white man moving into the predominately asian area of glodwick .
overall four out of every ten of the 11,000 inhabitants in the ward of st mary 's , of which glodwick is part , are of pakistani or bangladeshi descent .
it 's rare to see a white face in glodwick road and even rarer in waterloo street at the heart of the glodwick district .
it will be the first time that jeremy has lived in an area of oldham where white people are not in the majority .
and he says a few years ago he would never have contemplated it , especially after the racially-motivated violence of may 2001 .
there 's more mixing going on than when i first moved here eight years ago , then it was definitely just whites on this street rachel brookbank divide ' remains ' after riots " i was n't keen on the area before but it 's quieter now , i 've got a flat here and it 's better than nothing , " he says .
but jeremy 's friend annette turner from failsworth , a largely white district of oldham , is adamant she would never venture into glodwick after dark .
" i wo n't come here at night because it 's just a no-go for whites .
the problems have never got better , there are still no-go areas , it 's unbelievable .
there are areas where whites ca n't go and they ca n't come into ours . "
' non-traditional areas ' such comments bring to mind the " parallel lives " described by ted cantle in his report for the home office on the causes of the racially-motivated violence in oldham and a string of northern towns and cities five years ago .
oldham residents air their views on racial integration in pictures just five miles away the saddleworth ward has a population which is 97 % white .
and even within glodwick there are few streets where white and asian people live side by side .
moves like jeremy heap 's are part of a policy by first choice homes , the company which manages oldham 's council 's housing stock , to encourage more integration .
equalities and cohesion manager uspar miah , says a lot of effort is put into supporting those who move into areas where they will be very much in the minority .
the policy is not just dictated by a desire to integrate communities but also by practicality and a dwindling stock of houses .
" what we found is the asian families require larger homes but larger homes tend to be in what are considered " non-traditional areas " for asian families - very strong indigenous white areas .
" and some of the smaller houses were in the asian areas .
so obviously that balance was something we had to redress . "
and he says , with the correct backing , those who move into " non-traditional " areas settle down well .
" in the last financial year we supported more than 140 families moving into what are classed as non-traditional areas .
out of those 140 only one person has n't stayed . "
there 's a lot of deprivation among the ethnic communities so it 's difficult for them to move councillor riaz ahmad local rachel brookbank agrees oldham is becoming more integrated .
she has seen changes in her area of glodwick .
" where i live there are mostly white families but there 's more mixing going on than when i first moved here eight years ago , then it was definitely just whites on this street , " she says .
' deprivation ' st mary 's councillor and former oldham mayor riaz ahmad - whose house was firebombed during the 2001 disturbances - backs the drive to create more racially-mixed areas .
efforts are being made to integrate oldham 's distinct communities mr ahmad says the predominance of asians in glodwick does not reflect a desire to remain separate from the white community .
" there 's a lot of deprivation among the ethnic communities so it 's difficult for them to move , even if they would like to move they ca n't afford to because they 're unemployed or on a low wage . "
mohammed ansar of glodwick 's pakistani community centre says that even after the troubles of 2001 , they still do not have the resources to deal with the deprivation in the area .
" i have not seen much improvement in facilities for ethnic minorities particularly youth facilities .
there are only two sessions per week of a youth club in the whole of glodwick and that 's an improvement as they had nothing before , " mr ansar says .
" so there are limitations , we need a lot more resources to serve the people around here efficiently and effectively , to really address their issues . "

the government and police are still trying to trace many of them .
how many of the foreign criminals are still at large ?
eighty-five of the 186 serious foreign offenders are still free .
but the home office says 27 of the 37 " most serious " offenders , were in jail , including four murderers , and two were thought to be dead .
of the 149 other " more serious " offenders , 66 are now under control and six have been deported , it says .
in total , the home office says it has now started considering deportation in 999 of the 1,019 cases .
how many of them have reoffended since being freed ?
the home office says eight of the 37 most serious offenders have committed more crimes , but not involving violence or a sexual element .
thirteen of the 149 more serious offenders have committed crimes involving violence or a sexual element since their release .
earlier figures suggested another 30 have reoffended with other crimes .
what should have happened ?
foreign citizens face the prospect of deportation from the uk if they are convicted of committing a crime that carries a sentence of imprisonment .
the prison service is expected to notify the home office 's immigration and nationality directorate -lrb- ind -rrb- that a foreign inmate subject to possible deportation is being held before they are released .
in march 2005 ministers circulated a document entitled prison service order 6000 to all prison governors in an attempt to tighten up this process .
under the order , governors were told to begin talks over deportation at least 26 weeks ahead of offenders ' potential release .
with higher-risk offenders , the process should start 45 weeks before potential release date .
the document also highlighted the possibility of such cases being overlooked and supplied a hotline number for governors to get in touch with the ind 's senior lawyers .
do courts recommend deportation ?
in some cases a judge recommends at the time of sentencing that a criminal should be deported .
but such a recommendation will usually be made by a court only where a foreign defendant is convicted of serious offences .
in cases of murder or rape , for example , a judge will often recommend a foreign national be removed from the uk on completion of their sentence .
in the current row , about 160 of the prisoners were subject to specific orders from courts recommending their removal .
what happens if no recommendation is made in court ?
the criminal justice act 2003 introduced guidelines on dealing with cases where no court order was made .
under the act , prisoners from outside the european economic area -lrb- eu countries plus iceland , norway and lichtenstein -rrb- should be considered for deportation if they are sentenced to at least a year in jail .
those from within the eea have to be sentenced to at least two years ' imprisonment to be considered for deportation .
but deportation within the eea depends on the home secretary being able to prove that the individual presents a serious threat to the fundamental interests of society - someone who is likely to commit a serious crime in the future .
a foreign citizen should also be considered for deportation if convicted of three lesser offences .
who makes the decisions ?
civil servants at the immigration and nationality directorate review the cases .
the home secretary 's office will need to approve any recommendation before the actual deportation takes place .
a prisoner does have a right to appeal against the decision .
what criteria are used ?
the seriousness of the offence and an individual 's potential for re-offending will be considered .
the age of the person and their ties to the uk will also be taken into account .
officials will see whether there are any compassionate grounds for the person to remain , as well as considering the uk 's obligations under the human rights act .
will a prisoner ever be freed before a deportation decision is reached ?
if a decision has not been made before release date , a foreign prisoner may be held in an immigration detention centre .
however , detention depends on an assessment of the prisoner 's risk and the likelihood of them absconding .
a prisoner could be freed pending a deportation decision , but may be asked to wear an electronic tag or made the subject of restriction orders .
what circumstances can prevent a deportation ?
there are three key factors that may stop or delay a proposed deportation taking place .
firstly , there is the target country 's willingness to accept the return of an individual in a process known as redocumentation .
governments have to agree the transfer of criminals , but countries such as china refuse to accept redocumentation of criminals .
secondly , immigration officials sometimes can not prove where someone is actually from , particularly if the person facing deportation refuses to co-operate .
thirdly , under human rights laws nobody can be returned to a country where they will be subject to ill treatment .
for example , a murderer could not be deported to their home country if they would be likely to face execution .
how is the system now going to change ?
the man at the top has already gone .
charles clarke was sacked as home secretary in the recent cabinet reshuffle and replaced by john reid .
mr reid says he wants to be able to deport automatically any foreign nationals who received " significant " jail sentences .

in the current row , about 160 of the prisoners were subject to specific orders from courts recommending their removal .
what happens if no recommendation is made in court ?
the criminal justice act 2003 introduced guidelines on dealing with cases where no court order was made .
under the act , prisoners from outside the european economic area -lrb- eu countries plus iceland , norway and lichtenstein -rrb- should be considered for deportation if they are sentenced to at least a year in jail .
those from within the eea have to be sentenced to at least two years ' imprisonment to be considered for deportation .
but deportation within the eea depends on the home secretary being able to prove that the individual presents a serious threat to the fundamental interests of society - someone who is likely to commit a serious crime in the future .
a foreign citizen should also be considered for deportation if convicted of three lesser offences .
who makes the decisions ?
civil servants at the immigration and nationality directorate review the cases .
the home secretary 's office will need to approve any recommendation before the actual deportation takes place .
a prisoner does have a right to appeal against the decision .
what criteria are used ?
the seriousness of the offence and an individual 's potential for re-offending will be considered .
the age of the person and their ties to the uk will also be taken into account .
officials will see whether there are any compassionate grounds for the person to remain , as well as considering the uk 's obligations under the human rights act .
will a prisoner ever be freed before a deportation decision is reached ?
if a decision has not been made before release date , a foreign prisoner may be held in an immigration detention centre .
however , detention depends on an assessment of the prisoner 's risk and the likelihood of them absconding .
a prisoner could be freed pending a deportation decision , but may be asked to wear an electronic tag or made the subject of restriction orders .
what circumstances can prevent a deportation ?
there are three key factors that may stop or delay a proposed deportation taking place .
firstly , there is the target country 's willingness to accept the return of an individual in a process known as redocumentation .
governments have to agree the transfer of criminals , but countries such as china refuse to accept redocumentation of criminals .
secondly , immigration officials sometimes can not prove where someone is actually from , particularly if the person facing deportation refuses to co-operate .
thirdly , under human rights laws nobody can be returned to a country where they will be subject to ill treatment .
for example , a murderer could not be deported to their home country if they would be likely to face execution .
how is the system now going to change ?
the man at the top has already gone .
charles clarke was sacked as home secretary in the recent cabinet reshuffle and replaced by john reid .
mr reid says he wants to be able to deport automatically any foreign nationals who received " significant " jail sentences .

the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- is set to look into whether the market , which is dominated by baa , is competitive .
if the oft finds any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour , it could refer the industry to the competition commission for a full investigation .
baa has rejected a £ 8.7bn bid from a consortium headed by spain 's ferrovial .
baa revealed plans on thursday to return £ 750m in capital to shareholders should ferrovial 's takeover bid lapse .
consumer impact baa operates heathrow , gatwick and stansted airports , handling more than 90 % of all passengers in the london area and 63 % nationally .
the oft said it was considering launching a " market study " into the industry 's structure , including baa 's position in the market . "
competition in air transport is an extremely important part of the uk economy " john fingleton , office of fair trading the decision on whether to go ahead is due next month , and experts consider such a move likely .
the study - which would be the first undertaken by regulators - could potentially lead to a full competition inquiry .
the oft 's announcement only days after the european commission said it would not object to ferrovial acquiring baa .
" competition in air transport is an extremely important part of the uk economy , with a significant impact on uk consumers and business alike , " said john fingleton , the oft 's chief executive .
" we have decided to look more closely at how the airport markets work with the aim of establishing whether the current market structure delivers best value for air travellers . "
baa reaction baa said the regulator 's move came as a " complete surprise " but said it would co-operate with any enquiry .
" baa 's major businesses are already price regulated by the caa and the competition commission in the interest of airport users , " it said in a statement .

his arrest last week , for alleged trespassing , was dismissed in court on monday .
he was released with a warning .
jolie , whose baby is due this month , arrived in namibia six weeks ago with her partner brad pitt .

" the forum believes citizens have a right to privacy , however journalists also have a right to be able to do their jobs without unfair hindrance or intimidation , " the forum said in a statement .
on his release last week , mr liebenberg told reuters press agency that police may have wanted to use his case as a warning to other photographers and media .

but we have been very respectful to -lsb- the couple -rsb- , " he said .
jolie and pitt have sparked a media frenzy since the couple arrived at the coastal resort of walvis bay in april .
bodyguards and undercover namibian police officers have shielded them from journalists , erecting green cloth screens around the beach resort where they are staying .
the namibian government has said foreign journalists wanting to cover the birth must have written permission from pitt and jolie to enter the country and obtain a work permit .

which have made the biggest impression as the festival enters its final days ?
two films - pedro almodovar 's volver and alejandro gonzales inarritu 's babel - are emerging as the critics ' favourites at this year 's cannes film festival .
in volver , starring penelope cruz , two sisters have to rely on each other after the death of their mother and after one of the siblings murders her abusive husband .
penelope cruz has been widely praised for her role in volver almodovar touches on many of his favourite themes - such as womanhood and matriarchy - using his favourite device of farce but leaving out the overt transexualism which is the hallmark of his past work .
inarritu 's film babel centres on the relationship between parents and children .
two tourists - brad pitt and cate blanchett - face tragedy in morocco , while in los angeles and mexico their nanny inadvertently puts their children in danger and in japan a schoolgirl struggles to deal with the suicide of her mother .
" the competition on the whole has been very strong , " said critic derek malcolm , of london 's evening standard .
' best work ' " everybody realises that volver is a very good almodovar film .
most people would be very happy for him to win the palme d 'or . "
almodovar has never won the palme d 'or although he was shortlisted in 1999 for all about my mother .
" volver was really well done .
penelope cruz was very good , " agreed jay stone , film writer for the canadian news service .
" volver is way out in front .
it is the best thing pedro almodovar has done , " said richard mowe of the irish examiner .
babel : " brilliantly filmed and acted " said the critics " it is a sum total of all his previous work with all his previous themes coming together . "
babel has also had a strong reception .
mr stone said : " it was really strong and the most emotional and involving film i have seen so far .
" it was the most confident in terms of the story telling .
i like almost everything about it . "
" babel pushed all the right buttons , " agreed mr mowe .
" it has all the contemporary themes which are to be applauded . "
confident debut siegfried mortkowitz , of deutsche presse-agentu , said : " babel was brilliantly filmed and acted .
it was the kind of film you have to go back to see it again because it was very profound . "
british film red road impressed many as a confident debut by director andrea arnold .
the movie is a bleak tale of obsession set in glasgow where a grieving wife and mother is drawn into the world of the man who killed her family as she sees him on a cctv camera .
the critics were universal on the biggest flop of the festival - richard kelly 's southland tales , a postmodern , fragmented tale of the future of the united states .
moretti 's il caimano is critical of former italian pm silvio berlusconi mr malcolm said it was " terrible " , while mr stone said it was " self-indulgent - throwing everything onto the screen and hoping some of it will stick " .
nanni moretti has shown his latest movie il caimano in competition .
moretti is one of the most celebrated italian directors and received global acclaim for his last film , the son 's room , in 2001 .
il caimano , the caiman , refers to moretti 's view of former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi as a predator or crocodile .
in the film an italian director of repute struggles to get his latest film made due to the social and political climate of the times .
very rarely does the jury agree with the critics derek malcolm " i was slightly disappointed in the nanni moretti film , " said mr mowe .
" there were a lot of good things in there but it could not decide which sort of film it wanted to be . "

which have made the biggest impression as the festival enters its final days ?
two films - pedro almodovar 's volver and alejandro gonzales inarritu 's babel - are emerging as the critics ' favourites at this year 's cannes film festival .
in volver , starring penelope cruz , two sisters have to rely on each other after the death of their mother and after one of the siblings murders her abusive husband .
almodovar touches on many of his favourite themes - such as womanhood and matriarchy - using his favourite device of farce but leaving out the overt transexualism which is the hallmark of his past work .
inarritu 's film babel centres on the relationship between parents and children .
two tourists - brad pitt and cate blanchett - face tragedy in morocco , while in los angeles and mexico their nanny inadvertently puts their children in danger and in japan a schoolgirl struggles to deal with the suicide of her mother .
" the competition on the whole has been very strong , " said critic derek malcolm , of london 's evening standard .
' best work ' " everybody realises that volver is a very good almodovar film .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- us tv pins hopes on new shows bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture thursday , 25 may 2006 , 08:19 gmt 09:19 uk us tv pins hopes on new shows by kevin young bbc news entertainment reporter the main us television networks have unveiled their autumn schedules , offering several brand new dramas and comedies which they hope will attract millions of viewers domestically and sell well around the world .
in particular nbc - one of the " big four " broadcasters along with abc , cbs and fox - must fill the gaps left by sitcom will and grace and presidential drama the west wing .
these have ended , with great fanfare , after eight and seven years respectively .
so what can audiences look forward to switching on to over the next six months ?
when it comes to drama , no fewer than four new programmes deal with hostage-taking and kidnapping .
standoff focuses on a group of negotiators , two of whom are romantically involved and trying to hide this from their colleagues .
hostages themselves are the subject of the nine , which tells of nine people who were held captive during a 52-hour bank robbery .
the twist is that it focuses on the aftermath of the siege and its effect on their lives , rather than the hold-up itself .
it also uses flashbacks similar to those seen in castaway drama lost to reveal more about the events which brought everybody together .
who is showing what ?
abc : big day , brothers and sisters , help me help you , let 's rob ... , six degrees , the nine cbs : shark fox : justice , standoff , ' til death , vanished nbc : heroes , kidnapped , raines , studio 60 on the sunset strip , 20 good years in kidnapped , leo , the 15-year-old son of the wealthy cain family in new york , goes missing .
the producers promise " the ransom is only just the beginning " .
and there are conspiracy theories aplenty when a senator 's wife disappears in vanished , co-produced by josh berman , who worked on forensic drama csi .
the man who masterminded csi is jerry bruckheimer , also the executive producer of crime series cold case and without a trace .
fans of his work will eagerly anticipate justice , which features four lawyers who take on cases which are controversial and newsworthy - usually because they involve celebrities .
meanwhile , heroes brings together a cast of attractive young people from a variety of backgrounds who discover they have extraordinary psychic powers - although perhaps the voices inside their heads are telling them that .
there are also some big names among the networks ' autumn drama line-ups .
jurassic park 's jeff goldblum plays an eccentric detective who finds ways to communicate with the dead victims of crimes he is investigating in raines .
the lead role in shark goes to hollywood veteran james woods , whose character swaps his job as a celebrity defence lawyer to become a prosecutor instead .
moving away from crime but sticking with major stars , calista flockhart from ally mcbeal and rachel griffiths , most recently known for six feet under , appear in brothers and sisters .
it brings several members of the same family together for a birthday celebration , at which many secrets and conflicts emerge .
stars to watch calista flockhart : brothers and sisters jeff goldblum : raines rachel griffiths : brothers and sisters mick jagger : let 's rob ...
matthew perry : studio 60 on the sunset strip jeri ryan : shark jeffrey tambor -lrb- above -rrb- : 20 good years bradley whitford : studio 60 on the sunset strip james woods : shark and jj abrams , the creator of lost and alias , is behind six degrees , which weaves together the intersecting lives of six strangers in new york .
if all of these dramas feel a little heavy-going , how about some of the new comedy on offer ?
studio 60 on the sunset strip should appeal to fans of friends and the west wing as it stars matthew perry and bradley whitford , who played chandler and josh respectively in those series .
it has echoes of 1990s cult hit the larry sanders show because both focus on the office politics among a tv programme 's production team .
jeffrey tambor - who played hank on the sanders programme - co-stars in 20 good years , in which two middle-aged men realise their lives are flashing by and decide to treat every day as if it is their last .
it looks as though brad garrett 's character in new comedy ' til death will be just as miserable as robert , the man he played in everybody loves raymond .
garrett starts off as a happy newlywed , but the jaded older couple next door have much to burden him with after their 20 years of marriage .
there is also a marital theme in big day , which employs the " real-time " approach of 24 to cover the joy and mishaps of a couple 's wedding day - but perhaps with fewer explosions than kiefer sutherland 's drama .
finally , a group of misfits plan to burgle mick jagger 's home in let 's rob ... , and it is to the rolling stones ' singer 's credit that he went along with the idea and also agreed to appear on the show as himself .
add to all these new programmes season three of lost and desperate housewives , the sixth series of 24 and the end of the sopranos , and it appears viewers will be spoilt for choice for a long time yet .

matthew perry : studio 60 on the sunset strip jeri ryan : shark jeffrey tambor -lrb- above -rrb- : 20 good years bradley whitford : studio 60 on the sunset strip james woods : shark and jj abrams , the creator of lost and alias , is behind six degrees , which weaves together the intersecting lives of six strangers in new york .
if all of these dramas feel a little heavy-going , how about some of the new comedy on offer ?
studio 60 on the sunset strip should appeal to fans of friends and the west wing as it stars matthew perry and bradley whitford , who played chandler and josh respectively in those series .
it has echoes of 1990s cult hit the larry sanders show because both focus on the office politics among a tv programme 's production team .
jeffrey tambor - who played hank on the sanders programme - co-stars in 20 good years , in which two middle-aged men realise their lives are flashing by and decide to treat every day as if it is their last .
it looks as though brad garrett 's character in new comedy ' til death will be just as miserable as robert , the man he played in everybody loves raymond .
garrett starts off as a happy newlywed , but the jaded older couple next door have much to burden him with after their 20 years of marriage .
james woods stars alongside jeri ryan in the new drama shark there is also a marital theme in big day , which employs the " real-time " approach of 24 to cover the joy and mishaps of a couple 's wedding day - but perhaps with fewer explosions than kiefer sutherland 's drama .
finally , a group of misfits plan to burgle mick jagger 's home in let 's rob ... , and it is to the rolling stones ' singer 's credit that he went along with the idea and also agreed to appear on the show as himself .
add to all these new programmes season three of lost and desperate housewives , the sixth series of 24 and the end of the sopranos , and it appears viewers will be spoilt for choice for a long time yet .

the family of 50 adders live on the a74 north of carlisle , which is soon to be widened into a motorway .
on thursday , highways agency staff were organising the relocation of the snakes before bulldozers move in .
the reptiles , some fitted with tracking transmitters , are being moved to other parts of the county .
work is due to start on a £ 174m upgrade of a 5.8-mile section of the a74 between carlisle and guards mill in july .
' environmental responsibilities ' highways agency project manager ziad el-balbisi said : " the area is rich in wildlife and we are doing everything possible to enhance and improve the environment wherever possible .
" adders have been found along the a74 and a relocation project is currently underway to capture the reptiles and move them to a new location .
" the highways agency takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously . "
measures are also being taken to protect squirrels , bats , barn owls and badgers , all of which have been identified in a wildlife survey of the surrounding area .
the section of a74 is the main westerly route between england and scotland and carries 44,000 vehicles a day , about 75 % of all cross border traffic - including about 10,000 heavy goods vehicles .

is it foolish to talk about african unity ?
africa day is celebrated on thursday 25 may - the day that the organisation of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- was formed in 1963 .
originating in the decolonisation struggles of the early 1960s , its goal was to propel a united continent towards peace and prosperity .
however it was later criticised for becoming an ineffective talking shop and in 2002 was succeeded by the african union -lrb- au -rrb- which advocates to change the lives of ordinary africans by boosting development , eradicating poverty and encouraging integration .
what do you think of pan-africanism ?
is it foolish to talk about african unity ?
is the dream of pan-africanism relevant today ?
or has it been killed by poverty and war ?
this debate is now closed .

your comments : pan-africanism is definitely alive .

paul doe , london , ukk i listened to dr kwame nkrumah 's speech delivered at the oau meeting in 1965 and i bet you pan-africanism is alive today but under heavy doses of medications from the west .

pan-africanism is now is only talking shops .
it can only be alive through political and economic integration .
owusu francis snr , accra , ghana the european union and the united states of america are clear cases of a success of willingness to be one .

however , african leaders must learn to let the people 's will prevail before any talk of african unity can be a reality .
ernest chi , gothenburg / sweden the dream of african unity is still relevant .
but i feel the dream will continue to be a far fetched one as long as african leadership remains hypocritical .
practicing what somebody called " politics of appeasement " and double standards .
the problems africa faces are real and must be confronted realistically .
for example we may see a political leader going wrong and doing something terribly wrong , but other heads of state still continue to embrace such a one and shower him with sorts of heroic terms .

is it foolish to talk about african unity ?
africa day is celebrated on thursday 25 may - the day that the organisation of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- was formed in 1963 .
originating in the decolonisation struggles of the early 1960s , its goal was to propel a united continent towards peace and prosperity .
however it was later criticised for becoming an ineffective talking shop and in 2002 was succeeded by the african union -lrb- au -rrb- which advocates to change the lives of ordinary africans by boosting development , eradicating poverty and encouraging integration .
what do you think of pan-africanism ?
is it foolish to talk about african unity ?
is the dream of pan-africanism relevant today ?
or has it been killed by poverty and war ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your comments : pan-africanism is definitely alive .
i am a togolese national i was born in ghana , my mother is ghanaian my grandmother is from benin i went to school in nigeria and my partner with whom i had a daughter is from the ivory coast .
long live pan-africanism ! ! ! ! ! !
paul doe , london , ukk i listened to dr kwame nkrumah 's speech delivered at the oau meeting in 1965 and i bet you pan-africanism is alive today but under heavy doses of medications from the west .
it is alive but sleeping .
pan-africanism is now is only talking shops .
it can only be alive through political and economic integration .
owusu francis snr , accra , ghana the european union and the united states of america are clear cases of a success of willingness to be one .
two hands are better than one .
however , african leaders must learn to let the people 's will prevail before any talk of african unity can be a reality .
ernest chi , gothenburg / sweden the dream of african unity is still relevant .
but i feel the dream will continue to be a far fetched one as long as african leadership remains hypocritical .
practicing what somebody called " politics of appeasement " and double standards .
the problems africa faces are real and must be confronted realistically .
for example we may see a political leader going wrong and doing something terribly wrong , but other heads of state still continue to embrace such a one and shower him with sorts of heroic terms .
i am and i get flabbergasted .
george m mutale , gaborone , botswana it does n't matter who colonised us , we need to forget this and focus on africa elizabeth gitau , nairobi , kenya .
i believe africa can unite if only we can empower and rely on ourselves , be extremely independent , stop the hating and the wars .
it does n't matter who colonised us , we need to forget this and focus on africa .
differences always exist but they should not hinder development , peace and prosperity africa .
elizabeth gitau , nairobi , kenya .
it would be wonderful if more african nations would work closer together in a way as it is done in the eu .
but i do n't think it is possible at the time being .
too many african leaders are still corrupt and without visions for their countries .
soren berg , middelfart , denmark pan-africanism has its obvious advantages .
the problem lies in commitment from both african leaders and its people .
wahid iddrisu , london , uk africa is the second largest continent in the world .
the continent has every kind of resource and mineral in the world today .
we should work hard to unite ourselves by beginning with regional agreements , and then eventually coming together .
it can be done if we put our heads to it .
rev. peter jones , kansas city , mo usa pan-africanism was a god idea / concept. however , with top level corruption and rampant poverty , everyone wants to become a president for life .
with civil wars in most of the african countries , and most countries in the north of africa not identifying themselves with the rest of africa , this concept is unlikely to take roots sylvester anami , a kenyan in gent belgium pan-africanism is dead , by all accounts .
the concept of justice and equality set forth by the trailblazers has been turned into a more deceptive one , worst than what they accused the former colonial masters of .
these ideologues have reduced african politics to a level comparable to cults and have totally disregarded justice , human rights and tolerance .
hassan bility , boston , ma / usa pan-africanism will happen , but not in the hands of black africans .
arabs will become the majority population in the north and north east , and chinese / indians will be the dominant populations in the east and south east , moving westward .
once these populations establish themselves , africa will become a stable and unified continent for trade .
jason m. hendler , melbourne , florida if europe can do it , why ca n't africa do it omorodion osula , boston , usa it is not foolish to talk about african unity .
it is well known that unity is strength .
if africa is united , a lot could be achieved and overcome .
i am a strong advocate of pan-africanism .
if europe can do it , why ca n't africa do it .
it is time for africa to unite and work for a common cause .
omorodion osula , boston , usa africa is diverse , has been and will always be .
africans need to realise the potential of this diversity and not look for hollow , idealistic unity which is not possible to achieve even within some countries in africa .
george anang 'a , uk london pan africanism can only be relevant when we treat our neighbours right ebi komonibo , houston , texas , usa pan africanism must not die !
all africans must think and act in the direction of ' what can i as an individual do to enhance or impact the life of the next person less fortunate ' .
the ' them vs. us ' syndrome does not remedy any situation and pan africanism can only be relevant when we treat our neighbours right .
ebi komonibo , houston , texas , usa forget all about the cocooning of pan-africanism .
the way to go is globalisation .
mafabi hubert , jinja , uganda i believe that pan-africanism is more than just a connection between different countries within the continent , but a linking of all people of african descent .
we exist all across the world and many of us suffer as much as those in africa .
having a unifying goal and forum to speak on what each sector endures allows us the opportunity to bring all people to a more even playing field .
allyson evans , los angeles , usa in fact you have used the right words " killed by poverty and war " if we really want a united africa , we can get it but not with all these greedy leaders who must alter the constitution to fit their selfish needs .
eragu hannington , kampala , uganda pan africanism does not exist any more .
african leaders spend most of their time consolidating their positions and even sponsoring rebels to topple their fellow african leaders .
furthermore , our leaders have plundered most of african resources leaving the indigenous in total abject poverty .
