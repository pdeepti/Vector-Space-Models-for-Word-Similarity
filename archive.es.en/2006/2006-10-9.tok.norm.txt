" we are focusing on the weaknesses of the country , and not encouraging them to change .
this is feeding a reluctance to make the reforms we are asking for , which in turn leads europe to the view that the turks simply ca n't manage it . " this is a dangerous spiral that threatens to lead to a global political failure of the highest order , " verheugen added . the commissioner 's remarks come a day after merkel returned from her first visit to turkey as german chancellor .
her party of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have long been in favor of offering ankara a " privileged partnership " rather than full membership . merkel : eu not ready for more members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would honor the eu 's standing agreements with turkey merkel was one of europe 's strongest proponents of the special arrangement with turkey , but since becoming chancellor she had said she would honor the eu 's decision on admitting turkey to the bloc , which experts said would not happen until at least 2014 . in her weekly video podcasts , merkel said the eu needed to clearly define it 's borders and added that the union was ready to take on more members than it has already agreed to . " we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " she said . however , merkel 's grand coalition partners , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , support turkey 's membership . goal remains full eu membership " it would be a disastrous mistake to slam the eu 's door shut in turkey 's face , " spd head kurt beck to the frankfurter allegemeinen sonntagszeitung , adding that turkey deserved a " fair chance " to prove it deserved full membership . a key sticking point in negotiations is turkey 's decision to open its ports and airports to cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 , only after the 25-member bloc ends trade embargos against turkish cypriots in the north of the island . though he has admitted there are issues that need to be settled before admitting turkey to the union , verheugen said the goal of talks needed to remain full membership . " we all have an interest in a turkey that is closely bound to the western world - one which is democratic , respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities , " he said .
" the reformers in turkey stand for all this and they need europe 's support . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 09.10.2006 french impose smoking ban on cafes , restaurants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french smokers should enjoy lighting up while they can french smokers will be headed outside as of february , when the country 's smoking ban takes effect in public places and extends to hotels , bars , restaurants and night clubs 11 months later . the last cigarette in french schools , shops , offices and other public places will be stubbed out on feb .
1 , 2007 , prime minister dominique de villepin announced on sunday . " the issue is ripe in our country , given the experiences that we know of elsewhere , " he said .
" i am convinced the french people are now ready . " but to make sure the french are eased into the ban , bars , restaurants and nightclubs will be given to jan .
1 , 2008 to adapt to new regulations that call for these venues to have installed strictly supervised smoking rooms , which staff will not be required enter or serve . villepin 's announcement followed a parliamentary committee 's recommendation last week that noted that some 70 percent of the public supports an effective ban on public smoking . anyone who lights up despite the new laws will be subject to fines of 75 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- while establishments that do not apply the ban will be charged 150 euros . some businesses not happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some businesses affected by the ban have reacted angrily many bar and restaurant owners reacted angrily to the proposal , saying they face major financial losses . " you have no idea how many customers i have here from britain and the us who say to me how glad they are that at least one country has n't succumbed to political correctness , " said laurent lefevre , owner of the paris bar au metro . " in a few months from now all my customers are going to be standing out on the street , which means in winter they wo n't come .
what 's going to be banned next ?
sex ? "
lefevre added . some dining establishment owners are not convinced a complete ban is the best way to balance enjoying life with improving public health . " protecting the public is a laudable aim , " said alain dutournier , chef at the michelin-starred carré des feuillants restaurant in paris .
" but smoking a cigarette or cigar after a meal is a comfort and pleasure which is part of the art of living . " the union of hospitality trades -lrb- umih -rrb- has said that fewer than 3 percent of restaurants and bars can afford the investment involved in setting up sealed smoking areas . paris promises help for tobacconists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health costs of smoking are becoming more recognized the government has promised financial help to tobacconists - many of them also bar and cafe owners - who are already suffering from a downturn in sales caused by a 40 percent cigarette price hike in the last three years . trade minister renaud dutreil has already announced a renegotiation of a contract agreed to three years ago to support tobacconists . the plan , which provided 160 million euros support last year , is scheduled to end at the end of next 2007 , but will be renegotiated to allow continued financial support , particularly to tobacconists in border zones . tobacco sales in france have fallen by 32 percent since the year 2003 , partly due to cheaper cigarette prices in bordering countries .
a total of 1,500 tobacconists have closed down since then , most of them in border areas public awareness of health risks the move follows similar bans introduced in ireland , italy and scotland triggered by changing public attitudes to smoking and growing acceptance of the risks of passive smoking . according to villepin , some 5,000 french people die every year from breathing other people 's fumes , a situation he called " totally unacceptable situation in terms of public health . " some 30 percent of france 's adult population smokes and some 66,000 smokers die each year , according to government statistics . villepin said in northern italy the number of under 60-year-olds suffering from cardiovascular illnesses fell by 10 percent in the five months following last year 's smoking ban . " we expect a very rapid improvement in public health , " he said . the state will pay a third of the cost of treatment for persons endeavoring to give up smoking , villepin added . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french government panel urges smoking ban in public places the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france .

1 , 2007 , prime minister dominique de villepin announced on sunday . " the issue is ripe in our country , given the experiences that we know of elsewhere , " he said .
" i am convinced the french people are now ready . " but to make sure the french are eased into the ban , bars , restaurants and nightclubs will be given to jan .
1 , 2008 to adapt to new regulations that call for these venues to have installed strictly supervised smoking rooms , which staff will not be required enter or serve . villepin 's announcement followed a parliamentary committee 's recommendation last week that noted that some 70 percent of the public supports an effective ban on public smoking . anyone who lights up despite the new laws will be subject to fines of 75 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- while establishments that do not apply the ban will be charged 150 euros . some businesses not happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some businesses affected by the ban have reacted angrily many bar and restaurant owners reacted angrily to the proposal , saying they face major financial losses . " you have no idea how many customers i have here from britain and the us who say to me how glad they are that at least one country has n't succumbed to political correctness , " said laurent lefevre , owner of the paris bar au metro . " in a few months from now all my customers are going to be standing out on the street , which means in winter they wo n't come .
what 's going to be banned next ?
sex ? "
lefevre added . some dining establishment owners are not convinced a complete ban is the best way to balance enjoying life with improving public health . " protecting the public is a laudable aim , " said alain dutournier , chef at the michelin-starred carré des feuillants restaurant in paris .
" but smoking a cigarette or cigar after a meal is a comfort and pleasure which is part of the art of living . " the union of hospitality trades -lrb- umih -rrb- has said that fewer than 3 percent of restaurants and bars can afford the investment involved in setting up sealed smoking areas . paris promises help for tobacconists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health costs of smoking are becoming more recognized the government has promised financial help to tobacconists - many of them also bar and cafe owners - who are already suffering from a downturn in sales caused by a 40 percent cigarette price hike in the last three years . trade minister renaud dutreil has already announced a renegotiation of a contract agreed to three years ago to support tobacconists . the plan , which provided 160 million euros support last year , is scheduled to end at the end of next 2007 , but will be renegotiated to allow continued financial support , particularly to tobacconists in border zones . tobacco sales in france have fallen by 32 percent since the year 2003 , partly due to cheaper cigarette prices in bordering countries .
a total of 1,500 tobacconists have closed down since then , most of them in border areas public awareness of health risks the move follows similar bans introduced in ireland , italy and scotland triggered by changing public attitudes to smoking and growing acceptance of the risks of passive smoking . according to villepin , some 5,000 french people die every year from breathing other people 's fumes , a situation he called " totally unacceptable situation in terms of public health . " some 30 percent of france 's adult population smokes and some 66,000 smokers die each year , according to government statistics . villepin said in northern italy the number of under 60-year-olds suffering from cardiovascular illnesses fell by 10 percent in the five months following last year 's smoking ban . " we expect a very rapid improvement in public health , " he said . the state will pay a third of the cost of treatment for persons endeavoring to give up smoking , villepin added . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french government panel urges smoking ban in public places the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france .

"
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response . " carrying out the test was unacceptable , " the eu said in a statement , adding that " the test profoundly jeopardizes regional stability and represents a severe threat to international peace and security . " however , the eu has also said it has no plans to cut humanitarian aid to north korea . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer strongly condemned north korea 's reported nuclear test and called an emergency meeting of the alliance 's ambassadors . after talks with members of the european union 's political and security committee , including eu foreign policy chief javier solana , de hoop scheffer said north korea 's test " … flies into the face of the international community . "
he also said that " it is a threat to world peace and security and will demand the strongest possible reaction from the international community . " germany has meanwhile summoned north korea 's ambassador to the foreign ministry .
germany condemned north korea 's reported test of a nuclear weapon and called for a " determined reaction " from the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean protester burns a banner showing kim jong-il during an anti-north korea rally in seoul on monday foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged the communist state to stop its nuclear weapons program immediately and to refrain from carrying out further tests . german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said north korea 's test " is an irresponsible step that will significantly increase tensions in the region . " " non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is an extremely important concern of the entire international community , " he added . first nuclear test on monday , pyongyang said it had conducted it first underground atomic test sunday evening , which the official korean central news agency described as an " historic event " aimed at bettering peace and security . the 15-member united nations security council scheduled an emergency meeting on the north korean test on monday . china , pyongyang 's closest ally in the region , expressed its " resolute opposition " to the " brazen " nuclear test . " china strongly demands the dprk -lrb- north korea -rrb- side to undertake its commitments to the non-nuclearization of the korean peninsula , and stop all actions that can lead to the deterioration of the situation , " the foreign ministry said in a statement on state television . china also urged north korea to return to six-party talks aimed at reining in pyongyang 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's isolation makes it difficult for the many people hungry to receive aid south korea angrily described north korea 's monday nuclear test as a betrayal and said its policy of engagement - a lifeline for the impoverished stalinist state - is under threat . " this is a grave threat to peace , not only on the korean peninsula but in the region , " president roh moo-hyun said in his first response to the north 's announcement which shocked the world . it said it is considering whether or not to suspend a scheduled aid shipment to north korea . japan and the united states have said they will step up work on their missile defense system , and japan says it 's considering stern measures immediately on north korea 's nuclear testing . more tests possible meanwhile , south korean authorities have been reporting unusual activities in a rugged area in north korea on monday , causing them to suspect that the communist state might be preparing a second nuclear test , a news report said . kim seung-gyu , head of south korea 's spy agency , told parliament that activity involving vehicles and some 30 to 40 people was under way at punggyeri in the north-eastern county of kilju , yonhap news agency reported . afp news agency quoted south korea 's intelligence chief , kim seung-gyu , who said north korea is believed to have stored up to 40 kilograms -lrb- 88 pounds -rrb- of plutonium , enough to make as many as seven nuclear bombs . defiant nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2001 satellite image of the taepodong missile launch complex in north korea - the nation test-fired various missles in july north korea 's alleged underground nuclear blast has defied international pressure to keep the secretive regime from becoming one of the world 's nuclear powers . it came just three days after a unanimous call from the un security council for north korea to abandon plans for testing a nuclear weapon . north korea is not a signatory of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbt -rrb- , which was adopted in 1996 by the united nations general assembly and ratified by 135 states . a decade after its adoption , the treaty has yet to come into force because not all of the nations with nuclear capacity have ratified it . of the seven countries known to possess nuclear weapons , only france , britain and russia have ratified the text .
the united states , china have signed but not ratified it , while india and pakistan have refused to sign . afp news agency has said that , in all , just over 2,047 nuclear weapons tests have been officially reported to have taken place throughout the world since the first blasts in 1945 .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

" we are focusing on the weaknesses of the country , and not encouraging them to change .
this is feeding a reluctance to make the reforms we are asking for , which in turn leads europe to the view that the turks simply ca n't manage it . " this is a dangerous spiral that threatens to lead to a global political failure of the highest order , " verheugen added . the commissioner 's remarks come a day after merkel returned from her first visit to turkey as german chancellor .
her party of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have long been in favor of offering ankara a " privileged partnership " rather than full membership . merkel : eu not ready for more members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would honor the eu 's standing agreements with turkey merkel was one of europe 's strongest proponents of the special arrangement with turkey , but since becoming chancellor she had said she would honor the eu 's decision on admitting turkey to the bloc , which experts said would not happen until at least 2014 . in her weekly video podcasts , merkel said the eu needed to clearly define it 's borders and added that the union was ready to take on more members than it has already agreed to . " we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " she said . however , merkel 's grand coalition partners , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , support turkey 's membership . goal remains full eu membership " it would be a disastrous mistake to slam the eu 's door shut in turkey 's face , " spd head kurt beck to the frankfurter allegemeinen sonntagszeitung , adding that turkey deserved a " fair chance " to prove it deserved full membership . a key sticking point in negotiations is turkey 's decision to open its ports and airports to cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 , only after the 25-member bloc ends trade embargos against turkish cypriots in the north of the island . though he has admitted there are issues that need to be settled before admitting turkey to the union , verheugen said the goal of talks needed to remain full membership . " we all have an interest in a turkey that is closely bound to the western world - one which is democratic , respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities , " he said .
" the reformers in turkey stand for all this and they need europe 's support .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.10.2006 " not everything can revolve around gas " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel have a lot to talk about dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .
natural gas will likely top the agenda . putin and merkel are set to meet in dresden to continue the so-called petersburg dialogue .
the yearly talks were initiated by putin and then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 as a forum for open discussion between their two countries .
the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?
what other issues will be discussed ? of course , the international situation will be discussed .
north korea has become a nuclear power .
this means that this issue will be at the top of the agenda .
iran will be on the table , and of course the situation in russia itself - with the murder -lrb- on saturday -rrb- of one of the most well-known russian journalists in the country , anna politkovskaya , and the new german eu presidency and how it will deal with russia . how important are these petersburg dialogues ? the petersburg dialogues started five years ago and in the first few years , only politicians or the business community came .
this year , things have changed , especially on the russian side , which includes some human rights activists - real human rights activists , not just those organized by the kremlin .
one can expect a really critical debate on many human and civil rights issues inside the russian delegation .
that is a novelty in these dialogues . alexander rahr is an expert on russia at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations . michael lawton interviewed alexander rahr -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

" many colleagues knew karen fischer and christian struwe well and appreciated them as people , " said deutsche welle spokesman johannes hoffmann . " no one can really believe that they are no longer with us , " he said .
he added that deutsche welle wanted to provide its workers with the opportunity to say goodbye to fischer and struwe . during the 20-minute commemoration service , deutsche welle 's director general , erik bettermann , described fischer 's and struwe 's unique qualities both as people and as professional journalists .
he called them " friendly and dedicated . " memorial books were laid out in the dw 's foyer and an intranet version has been established for colleagues to pay their respects in writing . no clear suspects fischer , 30 , and struwe , 38 , who were in afghanistan conducting private research for a documentary , were shot in the province of baghlan early saturday morning , according to a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry , which handles police affairs . the governor of baghlan province , said ekramuddin massumie , told the german news agency dpa on sunday that five to six people had been identified as suspects and the authorities were " almost certain " that they were directly involved in the murders . they were the first foreign journalists to be killed in the country since 2001 . " the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said . " recently there were no security incidents in those areas , " bashary said .
" i do n't know what happened this time ... we are working on that . " investigation german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the journalists ' deaths . " this heinous crime must be solved and the perpetrators brought before justice , " he said while expressing his condolences to the victims ' families , friends and colleagues . dw 's erik betterman called on afghan authorities sunday to clarify the circumstances surrounding the murder of the two journalists in northern afghanistan . bettermann also called on radio television afghanistan and the isaf to cast some light on what happened . earlier , bettermann had also given his condolences to fischer 's and struwe 's families and praised their work in the middle east . afghanistan 's north calmer than the south baghlan is relatively calm and has seen little of the taliban-linked violence that is plaguing southern and eastern afghanistan although unrest has increased there this year . unknown gunmen killed a canadian carpenter in baghlan in july .
mike frastacky , 56 , had been working for four years to build a school in the area .
the circumstances behind his murder are still unclear . three foreign and one afghan journalists were killed in a brutal attack in afghanistan in november 2001 as they were approaching kabul to do a story on the fall of the extremist taliban regime in a us-led invasion . karen fischer freelanced for the past three years for deutsche welle 's english and german radio programs and focused her work on conflicts in the middle east as well as the reconstruction of afghanistan .
she traveled to the area a number of times for deutsche welle , filing reports on a number of issues including the afghan elections . christian struwe helped set up and train journalists for radio television afghanistan 's international news department , a public project supported by the deutsche welle .

natural gas will likely top the agenda . putin and merkel are set to meet in dresden to continue the so-called petersburg dialogue .
the yearly talks were initiated by putin and then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 as a forum for open discussion between their two countries .
the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?
what other issues will be discussed ? of course , the international situation will be discussed .
north korea has become a nuclear power .
this means that this issue will be at the top of the agenda .
iran will be on the table , and of course the situation in russia itself - with the murder -lrb- on saturday -rrb- of one of the most well-known russian journalists in the country , anna politkovskaya , and the new german eu presidency and how it will deal with russia . how important are these petersburg dialogues ? the petersburg dialogues started five years ago and in the first few years , only politicians or the business community came .
this year , things have changed , especially on the russian side , which includes some human rights activists - real human rights activists , not just those organized by the kremlin .
one can expect a really critical debate on many human and civil rights issues inside the russian delegation .
that is a novelty in these dialogues . alexander rahr is an expert on russia at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations . michael lawton interviewed alexander rahr -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

1 , 2007 , prime minister dominique de villepin announced on sunday . " the issue is ripe in our country , given the experiences that we know of elsewhere , " he said .
" i am convinced the french people are now ready . " but to make sure the french are eased into the ban , bars , restaurants and nightclubs will be given to jan .
1 , 2008 to adapt to new regulations that call for these venues to have installed strictly supervised smoking rooms , which staff will not be required enter or serve . villepin 's announcement followed a parliamentary committee 's recommendation last week that noted that some 70 percent of the public supports an effective ban on public smoking . anyone who lights up despite the new laws will be subject to fines of 75 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- while establishments that do not apply the ban will be charged 150 euros . some businesses not happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some businesses affected by the ban have reacted angrily many bar and restaurant owners reacted angrily to the proposal , saying they face major financial losses . " you have no idea how many customers i have here from britain and the us who say to me how glad they are that at least one country has n't succumbed to political correctness , " said laurent lefevre , owner of the paris bar au metro . " in a few months from now all my customers are going to be standing out on the street , which means in winter they wo n't come .
what 's going to be banned next ?
sex ? "
lefevre added . some dining establishment owners are not convinced a complete ban is the best way to balance enjoying life with improving public health . " protecting the public is a laudable aim , " said alain dutournier , chef at the michelin-starred carré des feuillants restaurant in paris .
" but smoking a cigarette or cigar after a meal is a comfort and pleasure which is part of the art of living . " the union of hospitality trades -lrb- umih -rrb- has said that fewer than 3 percent of restaurants and bars can afford the investment involved in setting up sealed smoking areas . paris promises help for tobacconists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health costs of smoking are becoming more recognized the government has promised financial help to tobacconists - many of them also bar and cafe owners - who are already suffering from a downturn in sales caused by a 40 percent cigarette price hike in the last three years . trade minister renaud dutreil has already announced a renegotiation of a contract agreed to three years ago to support tobacconists . the plan , which provided 160 million euros support last year , is scheduled to end at the end of next 2007 , but will be renegotiated to allow continued financial support , particularly to tobacconists in border zones . tobacco sales in france have fallen by 32 percent since the year 2003 , partly due to cheaper cigarette prices in bordering countries .
a total of 1,500 tobacconists have closed down since then , most of them in border areas public awareness of health risks the move follows similar bans introduced in ireland , italy and scotland triggered by changing public attitudes to smoking and growing acceptance of the risks of passive smoking . according to villepin , some 5,000 french people die every year from breathing other people 's fumes , a situation he called " totally unacceptable situation in terms of public health . " some 30 percent of france 's adult population smokes and some 66,000 smokers die each year , according to government statistics . villepin said in northern italy the number of under 60-year-olds suffering from cardiovascular illnesses fell by 10 percent in the five months following last year 's smoking ban . " we expect a very rapid improvement in public health , " he said . the state will pay a third of the cost of treatment for persons endeavoring to give up smoking , villepin added . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french government panel urges smoking ban in public places the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france .

1 , 2007 , prime minister dominique de villepin announced on sunday . " the issue is ripe in our country , given the experiences that we know of elsewhere , " he said .
" i am convinced the french people are now ready . " but to make sure the french are eased into the ban , bars , restaurants and nightclubs will be given to jan .
1 , 2008 to adapt to new regulations that call for these venues to have installed strictly supervised smoking rooms , which staff will not be required enter or serve . villepin 's announcement followed a parliamentary committee 's recommendation last week that noted that some 70 percent of the public supports an effective ban on public smoking . anyone who lights up despite the new laws will be subject to fines of 75 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- while establishments that do not apply the ban will be charged 150 euros . some businesses not happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some businesses affected by the ban have reacted angrily many bar and restaurant owners reacted angrily to the proposal , saying they face major financial losses . " you have no idea how many customers i have here from britain and the us who say to me how glad they are that at least one country has n't succumbed to political correctness , " said laurent lefevre , owner of the paris bar au metro . " in a few months from now all my customers are going to be standing out on the street , which means in winter they wo n't come .
what 's going to be banned next ?
sex ? "
lefevre added . some dining establishment owners are not convinced a complete ban is the best way to balance enjoying life with improving public health . " protecting the public is a laudable aim , " said alain dutournier , chef at the michelin-starred carré des feuillants restaurant in paris .
" but smoking a cigarette or cigar after a meal is a comfort and pleasure which is part of the art of living . " the union of hospitality trades -lrb- umih -rrb- has said that fewer than 3 percent of restaurants and bars can afford the investment involved in setting up sealed smoking areas . paris promises help for tobacconists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health costs of smoking are becoming more recognized the government has promised financial help to tobacconists - many of them also bar and cafe owners - who are already suffering from a downturn in sales caused by a 40 percent cigarette price hike in the last three years . trade minister renaud dutreil has already announced a renegotiation of a contract agreed to three years ago to support tobacconists . the plan , which provided 160 million euros support last year , is scheduled to end at the end of next 2007 , but will be renegotiated to allow continued financial support , particularly to tobacconists in border zones . tobacco sales in france have fallen by 32 percent since the year 2003 , partly due to cheaper cigarette prices in bordering countries .
a total of 1,500 tobacconists have closed down since then , most of them in border areas public awareness of health risks the move follows similar bans introduced in ireland , italy and scotland triggered by changing public attitudes to smoking and growing acceptance of the risks of passive smoking . according to villepin , some 5,000 french people die every year from breathing other people 's fumes , a situation he called " totally unacceptable situation in terms of public health . " some 30 percent of france 's adult population smokes and some 66,000 smokers die each year , according to government statistics . villepin said in northern italy the number of under 60-year-olds suffering from cardiovascular illnesses fell by 10 percent in the five months following last year 's smoking ban . " we expect a very rapid improvement in public health , " he said . the state will pay a third of the cost of treatment for persons endeavoring to give up smoking , villepin added . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french government panel urges smoking ban in public places the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france .

i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .

what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2006 musical chairs in the executive suite at beleaguered airbus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had repeated delivery problems the ceo of the eads subsidiary airbus has reportedly resigned over disputes he had with the parent company involving restructuring the troubled aircraft manufacturer . after only three months at the troubled european aircraft manufacturer airbus , its french chief executive christian streiff , 52 , has decided to throw in the towel .
the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : europe 's trundling flight of fancy the latest production delay for airbus ' super-jumbo sheds light on profound problems faced by the company .
top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2006 musical chairs in the executive suite at beleaguered airbus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had repeated delivery problems the ceo of the eads subsidiary airbus has reportedly resigned over disputes he had with the parent company involving restructuring the troubled aircraft manufacturer . after only three months at the troubled european aircraft manufacturer airbus , its french chief executive christian streiff , 52 , has decided to throw in the towel .
the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : europe 's trundling flight of fancy the latest production delay for airbus ' super-jumbo sheds light on profound problems faced by the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.10.2006 " not everything can revolve around gas " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel have a lot to talk about dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .
natural gas will likely top the agenda . putin and merkel are set to meet in dresden to continue the so-called petersburg dialogue .
the yearly talks were initiated by putin and then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 as a forum for open discussion between their two countries .
the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?
what other issues will be discussed ? of course , the international situation will be discussed .
north korea has become a nuclear power .
this means that this issue will be at the top of the agenda .
iran will be on the table , and of course the situation in russia itself - with the murder -lrb- on saturday -rrb- of one of the most well-known russian journalists in the country , anna politkovskaya , and the new german eu presidency and how it will deal with russia . how important are these petersburg dialogues ? the petersburg dialogues started five years ago and in the first few years , only politicians or the business community came .
this year , things have changed , especially on the russian side , which includes some human rights activists - real human rights activists , not just those organized by the kremlin .
one can expect a really critical debate on many human and civil rights issues inside the russian delegation .
that is a novelty in these dialogues . alexander rahr is an expert on russia at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations . michael lawton interviewed alexander rahr -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response .

natural gas will likely top the agenda . putin and merkel are set to meet in dresden to continue the so-called petersburg dialogue .
the yearly talks were initiated by putin and then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 as a forum for open discussion between their two countries .
the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?
what other issues will be discussed ? of course , the international situation will be discussed .
north korea has become a nuclear power .
this means that this issue will be at the top of the agenda .
iran will be on the table , and of course the situation in russia itself - with the murder -lrb- on saturday -rrb- of one of the most well-known russian journalists in the country , anna politkovskaya , and the new german eu presidency and how it will deal with russia . how important are these petersburg dialogues ? the petersburg dialogues started five years ago and in the first few years , only politicians or the business community came .
this year , things have changed , especially on the russian side , which includes some human rights activists - real human rights activists , not just those organized by the kremlin .
one can expect a really critical debate on many human and civil rights issues inside the russian delegation .
that is a novelty in these dialogues . alexander rahr is an expert on russia at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations . michael lawton interviewed alexander rahr -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- russia to repay debt early despite german resistance meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .
germany has so far opposed this .
-lrb- 27.04.2006 -rrb- putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .
she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

1 , 2007 , prime minister dominique de villepin announced on sunday . " the issue is ripe in our country , given the experiences that we know of elsewhere , " he said .
" i am convinced the french people are now ready . " but to make sure the french are eased into the ban , bars , restaurants and nightclubs will be given to jan .
1 , 2008 to adapt to new regulations that call for these venues to have installed strictly supervised smoking rooms , which staff will not be required enter or serve . villepin 's announcement followed a parliamentary committee 's recommendation last week that noted that some 70 percent of the public supports an effective ban on public smoking . anyone who lights up despite the new laws will be subject to fines of 75 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- while establishments that do not apply the ban will be charged 150 euros . some businesses not happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some businesses affected by the ban have reacted angrily many bar and restaurant owners reacted angrily to the proposal , saying they face major financial losses . " you have no idea how many customers i have here from britain and the us who say to me how glad they are that at least one country has n't succumbed to political correctness , " said laurent lefevre , owner of the paris bar au metro . " in a few months from now all my customers are going to be standing out on the street , which means in winter they wo n't come .
what 's going to be banned next ?
sex ? "
lefevre added . some dining establishment owners are not convinced a complete ban is the best way to balance enjoying life with improving public health . " protecting the public is a laudable aim , " said alain dutournier , chef at the michelin-starred carré des feuillants restaurant in paris .
" but smoking a cigarette or cigar after a meal is a comfort and pleasure which is part of the art of living . " the union of hospitality trades -lrb- umih -rrb- has said that fewer than 3 percent of restaurants and bars can afford the investment involved in setting up sealed smoking areas . paris promises help for tobacconists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health costs of smoking are becoming more recognized the government has promised financial help to tobacconists - many of them also bar and cafe owners - who are already suffering from a downturn in sales caused by a 40 percent cigarette price hike in the last three years . trade minister renaud dutreil has already announced a renegotiation of a contract agreed to three years ago to support tobacconists . the plan , which provided 160 million euros support last year , is scheduled to end at the end of next 2007 , but will be renegotiated to allow continued financial support , particularly to tobacconists in border zones . tobacco sales in france have fallen by 32 percent since the year 2003 , partly due to cheaper cigarette prices in bordering countries .
a total of 1,500 tobacconists have closed down since then , most of them in border areas public awareness of health risks the move follows similar bans introduced in ireland , italy and scotland triggered by changing public attitudes to smoking and growing acceptance of the risks of passive smoking . according to villepin , some 5,000 french people die every year from breathing other people 's fumes , a situation he called " totally unacceptable situation in terms of public health . " some 30 percent of france 's adult population smokes and some 66,000 smokers die each year , according to government statistics . villepin said in northern italy the number of under 60-year-olds suffering from cardiovascular illnesses fell by 10 percent in the five months following last year 's smoking ban . " we expect a very rapid improvement in public health , " he said . the state will pay a third of the cost of treatment for persons endeavoring to give up smoking , villepin added . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french government panel urges smoking ban in public places the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france .

the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

"
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response . " carrying out the test was unacceptable , " the eu said in a statement , adding that " the test profoundly jeopardizes regional stability and represents a severe threat to international peace and security . " however , the eu has also said it has no plans to cut humanitarian aid to north korea . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer strongly condemned north korea 's reported nuclear test and called an emergency meeting of the alliance 's ambassadors . after talks with members of the european union 's political and security committee , including eu foreign policy chief javier solana , de hoop scheffer said north korea 's test " … flies into the face of the international community . "
he also said that " it is a threat to world peace and security and will demand the strongest possible reaction from the international community . " germany has meanwhile summoned north korea 's ambassador to the foreign ministry .
germany condemned north korea 's reported test of a nuclear weapon and called for a " determined reaction " from the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean protester burns a banner showing kim jong-il during an anti-north korea rally in seoul on monday foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged the communist state to stop its nuclear weapons program immediately and to refrain from carrying out further tests . german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said north korea 's test " is an irresponsible step that will significantly increase tensions in the region . " " non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is an extremely important concern of the entire international community , " he added . first nuclear test on monday , pyongyang said it had conducted it first underground atomic test sunday evening , which the official korean central news agency described as an " historic event " aimed at bettering peace and security . the 15-member united nations security council scheduled an emergency meeting on the north korean test on monday . china , pyongyang 's closest ally in the region , expressed its " resolute opposition " to the " brazen " nuclear test . " china strongly demands the dprk -lrb- north korea -rrb- side to undertake its commitments to the non-nuclearization of the korean peninsula , and stop all actions that can lead to the deterioration of the situation , " the foreign ministry said in a statement on state television . china also urged north korea to return to six-party talks aimed at reining in pyongyang 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's isolation makes it difficult for the many people hungry to receive aid south korea angrily described north korea 's monday nuclear test as a betrayal and said its policy of engagement - a lifeline for the impoverished stalinist state - is under threat . " this is a grave threat to peace , not only on the korean peninsula but in the region , " president roh moo-hyun said in his first response to the north 's announcement which shocked the world . it said it is considering whether or not to suspend a scheduled aid shipment to north korea . japan and the united states have said they will step up work on their missile defense system , and japan says it 's considering stern measures immediately on north korea 's nuclear testing . more tests possible meanwhile , south korean authorities have been reporting unusual activities in a rugged area in north korea on monday , causing them to suspect that the communist state might be preparing a second nuclear test , a news report said . kim seung-gyu , head of south korea 's spy agency , told parliament that activity involving vehicles and some 30 to 40 people was under way at punggyeri in the north-eastern county of kilju , yonhap news agency reported . afp news agency quoted south korea 's intelligence chief , kim seung-gyu , who said north korea is believed to have stored up to 40 kilograms -lrb- 88 pounds -rrb- of plutonium , enough to make as many as seven nuclear bombs . defiant nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2001 satellite image of the taepodong missile launch complex in north korea - the nation test-fired various missles in july north korea 's alleged underground nuclear blast has defied international pressure to keep the secretive regime from becoming one of the world 's nuclear powers . it came just three days after a unanimous call from the un security council for north korea to abandon plans for testing a nuclear weapon . north korea is not a signatory of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbt -rrb- , which was adopted in 1996 by the united nations general assembly and ratified by 135 states . a decade after its adoption , the treaty has yet to come into force because not all of the nations with nuclear capacity have ratified it . of the seven countries known to possess nuclear weapons , only france , britain and russia have ratified the text .
the united states , china have signed but not ratified it , while india and pakistan have refused to sign . afp news agency has said that , in all , just over 2,047 nuclear weapons tests have been officially reported to have taken place throughout the world since the first blasts in 1945 .

" we are focusing on the weaknesses of the country , and not encouraging them to change .
this is feeding a reluctance to make the reforms we are asking for , which in turn leads europe to the view that the turks simply ca n't manage it . " this is a dangerous spiral that threatens to lead to a global political failure of the highest order , " verheugen added . the commissioner 's remarks come a day after merkel returned from her first visit to turkey as german chancellor .
her party of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have long been in favor of offering ankara a " privileged partnership " rather than full membership . merkel : eu not ready for more members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would honor the eu 's standing agreements with turkey merkel was one of europe 's strongest proponents of the special arrangement with turkey , but since becoming chancellor she had said she would honor the eu 's decision on admitting turkey to the bloc , which experts said would not happen until at least 2014 . in her weekly video podcasts , merkel said the eu needed to clearly define it 's borders and added that the union was ready to take on more members than it has already agreed to . " we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " she said . however , merkel 's grand coalition partners , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , support turkey 's membership . goal remains full eu membership " it would be a disastrous mistake to slam the eu 's door shut in turkey 's face , " spd head kurt beck to the frankfurter allegemeinen sonntagszeitung , adding that turkey deserved a " fair chance " to prove it deserved full membership . a key sticking point in negotiations is turkey 's decision to open its ports and airports to cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 , only after the 25-member bloc ends trade embargos against turkish cypriots in the north of the island . though he has admitted there are issues that need to be settled before admitting turkey to the union , verheugen said the goal of talks needed to remain full membership . " we all have an interest in a turkey that is closely bound to the western world - one which is democratic , respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities , " he said .
" the reformers in turkey stand for all this and they need europe 's support . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

" we are focusing on the weaknesses of the country , and not encouraging them to change .
this is feeding a reluctance to make the reforms we are asking for , which in turn leads europe to the view that the turks simply ca n't manage it . " this is a dangerous spiral that threatens to lead to a global political failure of the highest order , " verheugen added . the commissioner 's remarks come a day after merkel returned from her first visit to turkey as german chancellor .
her party of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have long been in favor of offering ankara a " privileged partnership " rather than full membership . merkel : eu not ready for more members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would honor the eu 's standing agreements with turkey merkel was one of europe 's strongest proponents of the special arrangement with turkey , but since becoming chancellor she had said she would honor the eu 's decision on admitting turkey to the bloc , which experts said would not happen until at least 2014 . in her weekly video podcasts , merkel said the eu needed to clearly define it 's borders and added that the union was ready to take on more members than it has already agreed to . " we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " she said . however , merkel 's grand coalition partners , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , support turkey 's membership . goal remains full eu membership " it would be a disastrous mistake to slam the eu 's door shut in turkey 's face , " spd head kurt beck to the frankfurter allegemeinen sonntagszeitung , adding that turkey deserved a " fair chance " to prove it deserved full membership . a key sticking point in negotiations is turkey 's decision to open its ports and airports to cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 , only after the 25-member bloc ends trade embargos against turkish cypriots in the north of the island . though he has admitted there are issues that need to be settled before admitting turkey to the union , verheugen said the goal of talks needed to remain full membership . " we all have an interest in a turkey that is closely bound to the western world - one which is democratic , respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities , " he said .
" the reformers in turkey stand for all this and they need europe 's support . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 09.10.2006 french impose smoking ban on cafes , restaurants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french smokers should enjoy lighting up while they can french smokers will be headed outside as of february , when the country 's smoking ban takes effect in public places and extends to hotels , bars , restaurants and night clubs 11 months later . the last cigarette in french schools , shops , offices and other public places will be stubbed out on feb .
1 , 2007 , prime minister dominique de villepin announced on sunday . " the issue is ripe in our country , given the experiences that we know of elsewhere , " he said .
" i am convinced the french people are now ready . " but to make sure the french are eased into the ban , bars , restaurants and nightclubs will be given to jan .
1 , 2008 to adapt to new regulations that call for these venues to have installed strictly supervised smoking rooms , which staff will not be required enter or serve . villepin 's announcement followed a parliamentary committee 's recommendation last week that noted that some 70 percent of the public supports an effective ban on public smoking . anyone who lights up despite the new laws will be subject to fines of 75 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- while establishments that do not apply the ban will be charged 150 euros . some businesses not happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some businesses affected by the ban have reacted angrily many bar and restaurant owners reacted angrily to the proposal , saying they face major financial losses . " you have no idea how many customers i have here from britain and the us who say to me how glad they are that at least one country has n't succumbed to political correctness , " said laurent lefevre , owner of the paris bar au metro . " in a few months from now all my customers are going to be standing out on the street , which means in winter they wo n't come .
what 's going to be banned next ?
sex ? "
lefevre added . some dining establishment owners are not convinced a complete ban is the best way to balance enjoying life with improving public health . " protecting the public is a laudable aim , " said alain dutournier , chef at the michelin-starred carré des feuillants restaurant in paris .
" but smoking a cigarette or cigar after a meal is a comfort and pleasure which is part of the art of living . " the union of hospitality trades -lrb- umih -rrb- has said that fewer than 3 percent of restaurants and bars can afford the investment involved in setting up sealed smoking areas . paris promises help for tobacconists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health costs of smoking are becoming more recognized the government has promised financial help to tobacconists - many of them also bar and cafe owners - who are already suffering from a downturn in sales caused by a 40 percent cigarette price hike in the last three years . trade minister renaud dutreil has already announced a renegotiation of a contract agreed to three years ago to support tobacconists . the plan , which provided 160 million euros support last year , is scheduled to end at the end of next 2007 , but will be renegotiated to allow continued financial support , particularly to tobacconists in border zones . tobacco sales in france have fallen by 32 percent since the year 2003 , partly due to cheaper cigarette prices in bordering countries .
a total of 1,500 tobacconists have closed down since then , most of them in border areas public awareness of health risks the move follows similar bans introduced in ireland , italy and scotland triggered by changing public attitudes to smoking and growing acceptance of the risks of passive smoking . according to villepin , some 5,000 french people die every year from breathing other people 's fumes , a situation he called " totally unacceptable situation in terms of public health .

1 , 2007 , prime minister dominique de villepin announced on sunday . " the issue is ripe in our country , given the experiences that we know of elsewhere , " he said .
" i am convinced the french people are now ready . " but to make sure the french are eased into the ban , bars , restaurants and nightclubs will be given to jan .
1 , 2008 to adapt to new regulations that call for these venues to have installed strictly supervised smoking rooms , which staff will not be required enter or serve . villepin 's announcement followed a parliamentary committee 's recommendation last week that noted that some 70 percent of the public supports an effective ban on public smoking . anyone who lights up despite the new laws will be subject to fines of 75 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- while establishments that do not apply the ban will be charged 150 euros . some businesses not happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some businesses affected by the ban have reacted angrily many bar and restaurant owners reacted angrily to the proposal , saying they face major financial losses . " you have no idea how many customers i have here from britain and the us who say to me how glad they are that at least one country has n't succumbed to political correctness , " said laurent lefevre , owner of the paris bar au metro . " in a few months from now all my customers are going to be standing out on the street , which means in winter they wo n't come .
what 's going to be banned next ?
sex ? "
lefevre added . some dining establishment owners are not convinced a complete ban is the best way to balance enjoying life with improving public health . " protecting the public is a laudable aim , " said alain dutournier , chef at the michelin-starred carré des feuillants restaurant in paris .
" but smoking a cigarette or cigar after a meal is a comfort and pleasure which is part of the art of living . " the union of hospitality trades -lrb- umih -rrb- has said that fewer than 3 percent of restaurants and bars can afford the investment involved in setting up sealed smoking areas . paris promises help for tobacconists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the health costs of smoking are becoming more recognized the government has promised financial help to tobacconists - many of them also bar and cafe owners - who are already suffering from a downturn in sales caused by a 40 percent cigarette price hike in the last three years . trade minister renaud dutreil has already announced a renegotiation of a contract agreed to three years ago to support tobacconists . the plan , which provided 160 million euros support last year , is scheduled to end at the end of next 2007 , but will be renegotiated to allow continued financial support , particularly to tobacconists in border zones . tobacco sales in france have fallen by 32 percent since the year 2003 , partly due to cheaper cigarette prices in bordering countries .
a total of 1,500 tobacconists have closed down since then , most of them in border areas public awareness of health risks the move follows similar bans introduced in ireland , italy and scotland triggered by changing public attitudes to smoking and growing acceptance of the risks of passive smoking . according to villepin , some 5,000 french people die every year from breathing other people 's fumes , a situation he called " totally unacceptable situation in terms of public health . " some 30 percent of france 's adult population smokes and some 66,000 smokers die each year , according to government statistics . villepin said in northern italy the number of under 60-year-olds suffering from cardiovascular illnesses fell by 10 percent in the five months following last year 's smoking ban . " we expect a very rapid improvement in public health , " he said . the state will pay a third of the cost of treatment for persons endeavoring to give up smoking , villepin added . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french government panel urges smoking ban in public places the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : europe 's trundling flight of fancy the latest production delay for airbus ' super-jumbo sheds light on profound problems faced by the company .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day .

"
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response . " carrying out the test was unacceptable , " the eu said in a statement , adding that " the test profoundly jeopardizes regional stability and represents a severe threat to international peace and security . " however , the eu has also said it has no plans to cut humanitarian aid to north korea . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer strongly condemned north korea 's reported nuclear test and called an emergency meeting of the alliance 's ambassadors . after talks with members of the european union 's political and security committee , including eu foreign policy chief javier solana , de hoop scheffer said north korea 's test " … flies into the face of the international community . "
he also said that " it is a threat to world peace and security and will demand the strongest possible reaction from the international community . " germany has meanwhile summoned north korea 's ambassador to the foreign ministry .
germany condemned north korea 's reported test of a nuclear weapon and called for a " determined reaction " from the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean protester burns a banner showing kim jong-il during an anti-north korea rally in seoul on monday foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged the communist state to stop its nuclear weapons program immediately and to refrain from carrying out further tests . german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said north korea 's test " is an irresponsible step that will significantly increase tensions in the region . " " non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is an extremely important concern of the entire international community , " he added . first nuclear test on monday , pyongyang said it had conducted it first underground atomic test sunday evening , which the official korean central news agency described as an " historic event " aimed at bettering peace and security . the 15-member united nations security council scheduled an emergency meeting on the north korean test on monday . china , pyongyang 's closest ally in the region , expressed its " resolute opposition " to the " brazen " nuclear test . " china strongly demands the dprk -lrb- north korea -rrb- side to undertake its commitments to the non-nuclearization of the korean peninsula , and stop all actions that can lead to the deterioration of the situation , " the foreign ministry said in a statement on state television . china also urged north korea to return to six-party talks aimed at reining in pyongyang 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's isolation makes it difficult for the many people hungry to receive aid south korea angrily described north korea 's monday nuclear test as a betrayal and said its policy of engagement - a lifeline for the impoverished stalinist state - is under threat . " this is a grave threat to peace , not only on the korean peninsula but in the region , " president roh moo-hyun said in his first response to the north 's announcement which shocked the world . it said it is considering whether or not to suspend a scheduled aid shipment to north korea . japan and the united states have said they will step up work on their missile defense system , and japan says it 's considering stern measures immediately on north korea 's nuclear testing . more tests possible meanwhile , south korean authorities have been reporting unusual activities in a rugged area in north korea on monday , causing them to suspect that the communist state might be preparing a second nuclear test , a news report said . kim seung-gyu , head of south korea 's spy agency , told parliament that activity involving vehicles and some 30 to 40 people was under way at punggyeri in the north-eastern county of kilju , yonhap news agency reported . afp news agency quoted south korea 's intelligence chief , kim seung-gyu , who said north korea is believed to have stored up to 40 kilograms -lrb- 88 pounds -rrb- of plutonium , enough to make as many as seven nuclear bombs . defiant nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2001 satellite image of the taepodong missile launch complex in north korea - the nation test-fired various missles in july north korea 's alleged underground nuclear blast has defied international pressure to keep the secretive regime from becoming one of the world 's nuclear powers . it came just three days after a unanimous call from the un security council for north korea to abandon plans for testing a nuclear weapon . north korea is not a signatory of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbt -rrb- , which was adopted in 1996 by the united nations general assembly and ratified by 135 states . a decade after its adoption , the treaty has yet to come into force because not all of the nations with nuclear capacity have ratified it . of the seven countries known to possess nuclear weapons , only france , britain and russia have ratified the text .
the united states , china have signed but not ratified it , while india and pakistan have refused to sign . afp news agency has said that , in all , just over 2,047 nuclear weapons tests have been officially reported to have taken place throughout the world since the first blasts in 1945 .

"
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response . " carrying out the test was unacceptable , " the eu said in a statement , adding that " the test profoundly jeopardizes regional stability and represents a severe threat to international peace and security . " however , the eu has also said it has no plans to cut humanitarian aid to north korea . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer strongly condemned north korea 's reported nuclear test and called an emergency meeting of the alliance 's ambassadors . after talks with members of the european union 's political and security committee , including eu foreign policy chief javier solana , de hoop scheffer said north korea 's test " … flies into the face of the international community . "
he also said that " it is a threat to world peace and security and will demand the strongest possible reaction from the international community . " germany has meanwhile summoned north korea 's ambassador to the foreign ministry .
germany condemned north korea 's reported test of a nuclear weapon and called for a " determined reaction " from the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean protester burns a banner showing kim jong-il during an anti-north korea rally in seoul on monday foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged the communist state to stop its nuclear weapons program immediately and to refrain from carrying out further tests . german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said north korea 's test " is an irresponsible step that will significantly increase tensions in the region . " " non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is an extremely important concern of the entire international community , " he added . first nuclear test on monday , pyongyang said it had conducted it first underground atomic test sunday evening , which the official korean central news agency described as an " historic event " aimed at bettering peace and security . the 15-member united nations security council scheduled an emergency meeting on the north korean test on monday . china , pyongyang 's closest ally in the region , expressed its " resolute opposition " to the " brazen " nuclear test . " china strongly demands the dprk -lrb- north korea -rrb- side to undertake its commitments to the non-nuclearization of the korean peninsula , and stop all actions that can lead to the deterioration of the situation , " the foreign ministry said in a statement on state television . china also urged north korea to return to six-party talks aimed at reining in pyongyang 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's isolation makes it difficult for the many people hungry to receive aid south korea angrily described north korea 's monday nuclear test as a betrayal and said its policy of engagement - a lifeline for the impoverished stalinist state - is under threat .

what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.10.2006 " not everything can revolve around gas " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel have a lot to talk about dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .
natural gas will likely top the agenda . putin and merkel are set to meet in dresden to continue the so-called petersburg dialogue .
the yearly talks were initiated by putin and then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 as a forum for open discussion between their two countries .
the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?
what other issues will be discussed ? of course , the international situation will be discussed .
north korea has become a nuclear power .
this means that this issue will be at the top of the agenda .
iran will be on the table , and of course the situation in russia itself - with the murder -lrb- on saturday -rrb- of one of the most well-known russian journalists in the country , anna politkovskaya , and the new german eu presidency and how it will deal with russia . how important are these petersburg dialogues ? the petersburg dialogues started five years ago and in the first few years , only politicians or the business community came .
this year , things have changed , especially on the russian side , which includes some human rights activists - real human rights activists , not just those organized by the kremlin .
one can expect a really critical debate on many human and civil rights issues inside the russian delegation .
that is a novelty in these dialogues . alexander rahr is an expert on russia at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations . michael lawton interviewed alexander rahr -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- russia to repay debt early despite german resistance meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .
germany has so far opposed this .
-lrb- 27.04.2006 -rrb- putin cagey on iran issue after discussions with merkel german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow hoping for a firm offer of support from president vladimir putin on the subject of iran .
she left monday wondering what stance , if any , russia would take .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2006 musical chairs in the executive suite at beleaguered airbus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had repeated delivery problems the ceo of the eads subsidiary airbus has reportedly resigned over disputes he had with the parent company involving restructuring the troubled aircraft manufacturer . after only three months at the troubled european aircraft manufacturer airbus , its french chief executive christian streiff , 52 , has decided to throw in the towel .
the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : europe 's trundling flight of fancy the latest production delay for airbus ' super-jumbo sheds light on profound problems faced by the company .
top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

natural gas will likely top the agenda . putin and merkel are set to meet in dresden to continue the so-called petersburg dialogue .
the yearly talks were initiated by putin and then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 as a forum for open discussion between their two countries .
the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?
what other issues will be discussed ? of course , the international situation will be discussed .

iran will be on the table , and of course the situation in russia itself - with the murder -lrb- on saturday -rrb- of one of the most well-known russian journalists in the country , anna politkovskaya , and the new german eu presidency and how it will deal with russia . how important are these petersburg dialogues ? the petersburg dialogues started five years ago and in the first few years , only politicians or the business community came .
this year , things have changed , especially on the russian side , which includes some human rights activists - real human rights activists , not just those organized by the kremlin .
one can expect a really critical debate on many human and civil rights issues inside the russian delegation .
that is a novelty in these dialogues . alexander rahr is an expert on russia at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations . michael lawton interviewed alexander rahr -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

"
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response . " carrying out the test was unacceptable , " the eu said in a statement , adding that " the test profoundly jeopardizes regional stability and represents a severe threat to international peace and security . " however , the eu has also said it has no plans to cut humanitarian aid to north korea . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer strongly condemned north korea 's reported nuclear test and called an emergency meeting of the alliance 's ambassadors . after talks with members of the european union 's political and security committee , including eu foreign policy chief javier solana , de hoop scheffer said north korea 's test " … flies into the face of the international community . "
he also said that " it is a threat to world peace and security and will demand the strongest possible reaction from the international community . " germany has meanwhile summoned north korea 's ambassador to the foreign ministry .
germany condemned north korea 's reported test of a nuclear weapon and called for a " determined reaction " from the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean protester burns a banner showing kim jong-il during an anti-north korea rally in seoul on monday foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged the communist state to stop its nuclear weapons program immediately and to refrain from carrying out further tests . german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said north korea 's test " is an irresponsible step that will significantly increase tensions in the region . " " non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is an extremely important concern of the entire international community , " he added . first nuclear test on monday , pyongyang said it had conducted it first underground atomic test sunday evening , which the official korean central news agency described as an " historic event " aimed at bettering peace and security . the 15-member united nations security council scheduled an emergency meeting on the north korean test on monday . china , pyongyang 's closest ally in the region , expressed its " resolute opposition " to the " brazen " nuclear test . " china strongly demands the dprk -lrb- north korea -rrb- side to undertake its commitments to the non-nuclearization of the korean peninsula , and stop all actions that can lead to the deterioration of the situation , " the foreign ministry said in a statement on state television . china also urged north korea to return to six-party talks aimed at reining in pyongyang 's nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's isolation makes it difficult for the many people hungry to receive aid south korea angrily described north korea 's monday nuclear test as a betrayal and said its policy of engagement - a lifeline for the impoverished stalinist state - is under threat . " this is a grave threat to peace , not only on the korean peninsula but in the region , " president roh moo-hyun said in his first response to the north 's announcement which shocked the world . it said it is considering whether or not to suspend a scheduled aid shipment to north korea . japan and the united states have said they will step up work on their missile defense system , and japan says it 's considering stern measures immediately on north korea 's nuclear testing . more tests possible meanwhile , south korean authorities have been reporting unusual activities in a rugged area in north korea on monday , causing them to suspect that the communist state might be preparing a second nuclear test , a news report said . kim seung-gyu , head of south korea 's spy agency , told parliament that activity involving vehicles and some 30 to 40 people was under way at punggyeri in the north-eastern county of kilju , yonhap news agency reported . afp news agency quoted south korea 's intelligence chief , kim seung-gyu , who said north korea is believed to have stored up to 40 kilograms -lrb- 88 pounds -rrb- of plutonium , enough to make as many as seven nuclear bombs . defiant nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2001 satellite image of the taepodong missile launch complex in north korea - the nation test-fired various missles in july north korea 's alleged underground nuclear blast has defied international pressure to keep the secretive regime from becoming one of the world 's nuclear powers . it came just three days after a unanimous call from the un security council for north korea to abandon plans for testing a nuclear weapon . north korea is not a signatory of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbt -rrb- , which was adopted in 1996 by the united nations general assembly and ratified by 135 states . a decade after its adoption , the treaty has yet to come into force because not all of the nations with nuclear capacity have ratified it . of the seven countries known to possess nuclear weapons , only france , britain and russia have ratified the text .
the united states , china have signed but not ratified it , while india and pakistan have refused to sign . afp news agency has said that , in all , just over 2,047 nuclear weapons tests have been officially reported to have taken place throughout the world since the first blasts in 1945 .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.10.2006 memorial service held for deutsche welle journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an investigation is underway into the journalists ' deaths following the murders of two deutsche welle journalists in afghanistan over the weekend , colleagues commemorated karen fischer and christian struwe at its offices in bonn and berlin on monday . hundreds of fellow workers gathered to share a moment of silence to remember their fellow colleagues , who were shot dead in tents in afghanistan on saturday . " many colleagues knew karen fischer and christian struwe well and appreciated them as people , " said deutsche welle spokesman johannes hoffmann . " no one can really believe that they are no longer with us , " he said .
he added that deutsche welle wanted to provide its workers with the opportunity to say goodbye to fischer and struwe . during the 20-minute commemoration service , deutsche welle 's director general , erik bettermann , described fischer 's and struwe 's unique qualities both as people and as professional journalists .
he called them " friendly and dedicated . " memorial books were laid out in the dw 's foyer and an intranet version has been established for colleagues to pay their respects in writing . no clear suspects fischer , 30 , and struwe , 38 , who were in afghanistan conducting private research for a documentary , were shot in the province of baghlan early saturday morning , according to a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry , which handles police affairs . the governor of baghlan province , said ekramuddin massumie , told the german news agency dpa on sunday that five to six people had been identified as suspects and the authorities were " almost certain " that they were directly involved in the murders . they were the first foreign journalists to be killed in the country since 2001 . " the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said . " recently there were no security incidents in those areas , " bashary said .
" i do n't know what happened this time ... we are working on that . " investigation german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the journalists ' deaths . " this heinous crime must be solved and the perpetrators brought before justice , " he said while expressing his condolences to the victims ' families , friends and colleagues . dw 's erik betterman called on afghan authorities sunday to clarify the circumstances surrounding the murder of the two journalists in northern afghanistan . bettermann also called on radio television afghanistan and the isaf to cast some light on what happened . earlier , bettermann had also given his condolences to fischer 's and struwe 's families and praised their work in the middle east . afghanistan 's north calmer than the south baghlan is relatively calm and has seen little of the taliban-linked violence that is plaguing southern and eastern afghanistan although unrest has increased there this year . unknown gunmen killed a canadian carpenter in baghlan in july .
mike frastacky , 56 , had been working for four years to build a school in the area .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

" we want to bring together two worlds that do not know each other very well yet , " said anna-katharina werdnik , head of the book fair 's film and television division .
" we knew there was demand on both sides . " " harry potter , " " the lord of the rings " and " the devil wears prada " are just three examples of hit movies adapted from books .
linking popular authors to movie deals means a built-in audience for the films as well as new readers in the future when the movie becomes a hit . the frankfurt book fair , the publishing industry 's largest annual gathering , wrapped up sunday .
the five-day fair brought in 286,621 visitors and had more than 7,000 exhibitors from 113 countries . linking to the silver screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter jackson won a slew of awards for his adaptation of " lord of the rings " while the fair has long acted as a crucial link between authors and publishers , adding hollywood to the mix started relatively recently .
the fair had a film and tv forum , which experienced a 30 percent increase in traffic this year .
werdnik said she sees an enormous potential for the forum 's growth . " we are offering a special place for publishing houses and film studios to get together , " she said . the focus on films has brought a touch of glamour to the 58-year-old frankfurt book fair .
canadian director atom egoyan came to frankfurt to accept the fair 's prize for best film adaptation for his thriller " where the truth lies , " starring kevin bacon and colin firth .
the drama was based on a novel by rupert holmes . french filmmaker luc besson was at the fair to promote his animated feature " arthur and the invisibles , " which is based on a four-volume book he wrote himself .
besson said he was encouraged to see cinema playing a bigger role at the fair . " books and films can help each other - they are not enemies , " he said . creating blockbusters from books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent blockbuster " perfume " was adapted from a popular novel both authors and filmmakers said they realize good books have potential beyond the written page .
besson cited the example of " perfume , " a german bestseller by patrick süskind , which has sold more than 150 million copies since it was published in 1985 .
a blockbuster film recently revived the murder mystery .
" perfume " was screened during the fair as an example of the synergies that can exist between the two formats . since 2001 , the frankfurt fair has cooperated with the berlin international film festival by hosting a " berlinale day . " sonya heinen , who runs the co-production market at the berlinale , said the frankfurt book fair helps with networking and its topical seminars . " we are concentrating on practical aspects of deal-making , such as ways to acquire book options or how to help publishing houses sell their synopses , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair 2006 read dw-world.de 's collections of news stories and features on this year 's fair .

" we are focusing on the weaknesses of the country , and not encouraging them to change .
this is feeding a reluctance to make the reforms we are asking for , which in turn leads europe to the view that the turks simply ca n't manage it . " this is a dangerous spiral that threatens to lead to a global political failure of the highest order , " verheugen added . the commissioner 's remarks come a day after merkel returned from her first visit to turkey as german chancellor .
her party of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have long been in favor of offering ankara a " privileged partnership " rather than full membership . merkel : eu not ready for more members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would honor the eu 's standing agreements with turkey merkel was one of europe 's strongest proponents of the special arrangement with turkey , but since becoming chancellor she had said she would honor the eu 's decision on admitting turkey to the bloc , which experts said would not happen until at least 2014 . in her weekly video podcasts , merkel said the eu needed to clearly define it 's borders and added that the union was ready to take on more members than it has already agreed to . " we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " she said . however , merkel 's grand coalition partners , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , support turkey 's membership . goal remains full eu membership " it would be a disastrous mistake to slam the eu 's door shut in turkey 's face , " spd head kurt beck to the frankfurter allegemeinen sonntagszeitung , adding that turkey deserved a " fair chance " to prove it deserved full membership . a key sticking point in negotiations is turkey 's decision to open its ports and airports to cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 , only after the 25-member bloc ends trade embargos against turkish cypriots in the north of the island . though he has admitted there are issues that need to be settled before admitting turkey to the union , verheugen said the goal of talks needed to remain full membership . " we all have an interest in a turkey that is closely bound to the western world - one which is democratic , respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities , " he said .
" the reformers in turkey stand for all this and they need europe 's support . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2006 musical chairs in the executive suite at beleaguered airbus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had repeated delivery problems the ceo of the eads subsidiary airbus has reportedly resigned over disputes he had with the parent company involving restructuring the troubled aircraft manufacturer . after only three months at the troubled european aircraft manufacturer airbus , its french chief executive christian streiff , 52 , has decided to throw in the towel .
the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : europe 's trundling flight of fancy the latest production delay for airbus ' super-jumbo sheds light on profound problems faced by the company .
top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

natural gas will likely top the agenda . putin and merkel are set to meet in dresden to continue the so-called petersburg dialogue .
the yearly talks were initiated by putin and then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 as a forum for open discussion between their two countries .
the meetings take place alternately in dresden and st. petersburg . dw-radio : will gas be the only issue on the agenda ? alexander rahr : not everything can revolve around the gas issue , but the fact that germany has organized the second energy summit -lrb- on monday , involving experts on energy , energy company executives and lobby groups -rrb- in order to discusses the future of energy supplies to germany and to europe , where gas plays an important role - and gas does come from russia - means that gas will be one of the main topics , but not the only one . what kind of promises will merkel want from putin about the reliability of gas supplies ? mrs. merkel has already changed her attitude toward russia .
she is not conducting the same policy as gerhard schröder and helmut kohl .
she does not want to rely only on russia .
she will do certain things in the next few years to diversify german and european dependencies on russia .
i can not exclude that merkel wo n't move back to nuclear energy , although that would be very difficult in this coalition .
but i think she is refocusing her attention from russian gas to other alternatives .
what she wants mainly from putin is that the countries between germany and russia , the so-called transit countries , will be bound into a common energy alliance and energy strategy , and i think she is also fighting for more german rights , or more rights for german companies on russian territory .
at the same time , i think she wants russia to fulfill international obligations and sign the energy charter in order to make energy transport from russia to europe more open and transparent , but i think this is out of the question today for russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how friendly will talks be over nitty-gritty issues like human rights ?
what other issues will be discussed ? of course , the international situation will be discussed .
north korea has become a nuclear power .
this means that this issue will be at the top of the agenda .
iran will be on the table , and of course the situation in russia itself - with the murder -lrb- on saturday -rrb- of one of the most well-known russian journalists in the country , anna politkovskaya , and the new german eu presidency and how it will deal with russia . how important are these petersburg dialogues ? the petersburg dialogues started five years ago and in the first few years , only politicians or the business community came .
this year , things have changed , especially on the russian side , which includes some human rights activists - real human rights activists , not just those organized by the kremlin .
one can expect a really critical debate on many human and civil rights issues inside the russian delegation .
that is a novelty in these dialogues . alexander rahr is an expert on russia at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations . michael lawton interviewed alexander rahr -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2006 musical chairs in the executive suite at beleaguered airbus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had repeated delivery problems the ceo of the eads subsidiary airbus has reportedly resigned over disputes he had with the parent company involving restructuring the troubled aircraft manufacturer . after only three months at the troubled european aircraft manufacturer airbus , its french chief executive christian streiff , 52 , has decided to throw in the towel .
the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

the circumstances behind his murder are still unclear . three foreign and one afghan journalists were killed in a brutal attack in afghanistan in november 2001 as they were approaching kabul to do a story on the fall of the extremist taliban regime in a us-led invasion . karen fischer freelanced for the past three years for deutsche welle 's english and german radio programs and focused her work on conflicts in the middle east as well as the reconstruction of afghanistan .

the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2006 musical chairs in the executive suite at beleaguered airbus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had repeated delivery problems the ceo of the eads subsidiary airbus has reportedly resigned over disputes he had with the parent company involving restructuring the troubled aircraft manufacturer . after only three months at the troubled european aircraft manufacturer airbus , its french chief executive christian streiff , 52 , has decided to throw in the towel .
the european aerospace group eads , is expected to replace streiff , with another frenchman , louis gallois , 62 , who is co-chairman of the parent company , a source close to the matter told afp . leading private shareholders , german automaker daimlerchrysler , which owns 30 percent of eads , and french media group lagardere , have backed streiff 's resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co-chairman louis gallois is expected to be interim ceo of airbus eads owns 80 percent of airbus but assumes full ownership later this month , after british arms producer bae systems formally sells back its 20 percent stake for 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . delays to set airbus back by two years gallois , who would reportedly remain eads co-chairman in addition to heading its airbus subsidiary , had only joined the group this past july after 10 years of heading sncf , the french railways .
french press reports say , however , that gallois would be only an interim ceo of airbus until streiff 's replacement is found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the super jumbo jet a380 is now two years behind schedule according to several german press reports , streiff had sent in letters of resignation last week to both gallois and german co-chairman thomas enders .
streiff had been seeking greater autonomy in implementing his restructuring and cost-cutting plan for airbus , after further delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo jet were announced last week . the eads board , however , wanted to exert greater oversight control after revelations in june of cost overruns and major delays due to wiring and software design problems , and had apparently rejected streiff 's plans .
the additional delay means that delivery of the a380 would fall a full two years behind schedule , prompting several airlines to consider cancelling their orders or sue for compensation . airbus denies reports of streiff 's departure rumors that streiff was leaving airbus for the french automaker peugeot were reported in the french daily la tribune , but denied by airbus .
eads said reports of streiff 's departure are speculation . according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , the eads board and streiff had lost " mutual trust . "
the paper cited unidentified sources as saying that eads had accepted streiff 's resignation without officially announcing it . streiff joined airbus from the french glassmaker saint gobain in july , following the dismissal of his predecessor gustav humbert . proposals angered germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frenchman christian streiff 's proposal to shift a380 production facilities from hamburg to france did not sit well with the germans his proposal to shift all production of the a380 from hamburg to toulouse , france , did not sit well with the germans .
even though production of the smaller a320 single-aisle jet would still be concentrated in the hamburg factory , which employs 12,000 people , his plans alarmed politicians in germany , where airbus provides some 40,000 jobs at plants throughout the country . shares of eads fell by 1.6 percent on monday to 20.11 euros .
its shares had already fallen by 10 percent last week after announcements of further delays . later this week , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac meet ahead of a eu summit in paris and are expected to discuss the reorganization of airbus . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : europe 's trundling flight of fancy the latest production delay for airbus ' super-jumbo sheds light on profound problems faced by the company .
top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

hydrogen sulphide , a toxic gas that smells of rotten eggs , occurs naturally in swamps , springs and volcanoes .
but in mice , it was found to slow down heart rate and breathing and decrease body temperature , while keeping a normal blood pressure .
the results were presented at the american physiology society conference .
in the study carried out at massachusetts general hospital in boston , mice were administered the gas at a concentration of 80 parts per million - a tenth of the dose which is lethal in humans .
the problem with hypothermia is it 's not that easy to cool down the human body so if we can find another method to inhibit metabolism that would be very useful dr fumito ichinose the researchers reported that the heart rate fell from 500 to 200 beats per minute and respiration fell from 120 to 25 breaths per minute .
core body temperature also fell from 39 to 30 degrees c. despite the reduction in heart rate the blood pressure of the mice did not drop , which tends to happen with other techniques such as lowering body temperature .
when the researchers repeated the experiment at a higher room temperature , the heart and respiratory rate still fell significantly .
the effects of the gas seemed to be reversible with the mice returning to normal two hours after the mice started to breathe normal air again .
previous research had shown the ability of hydrogen sulphide to induce a state of hibernation in mice but the effects on the cardiovascular system were unknown .
some anaesthetics and sedatives can be used to slow down metabolism in the brain but currently the only way to protect other organs is to cool the body and induce hypothermia .
trauma patients dr fumito ichinose , assistant professor of anaesthesia at harvard medical school said that if the effects of hydrogen sulphide was confirmed in larger mammals it could be useful in helping to sustain the functionality of organs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or in patients with severe trauma .
" there was a large study published last year of patients who had cardiac arrest .
they kept them in a hypothermic state for a while and the outcome was much better .
" the problem with hypothermia is it 's not that easy to cool down the human body so if we can find another method to inhibit metabolism that would be very useful . "
dr ichinose added that the findings would need to be replicated in larger animals such as pigs as mice may be more susceptible to induced hibernation .
he added that the safety margin was small .
however , he said it was possible that a dose lower than 80 parts per million might also be effective .
but dr chris pomfrett , lecturer in neurophysiology applied to anaesthesia at the university of manchester said further studies were needed to clarify whether the reduced blood pressure and respiration were really associated with hibernation or whether the findings were a result of poisonous effects of the gas .
" my big question about this work is : is it reducing brain metabolism or simply having a toxic effect on the brain stem ?
" although the mice appeared normal they did n't look to see if there was any damage to the mice post-mortem .
" i would also do an electroencephalogram to measure brain activity in the mice . "
he added that there would be lots of problems with using hydrogen sulphide in clinical practice because it was so toxic .
" this is interesting and certainly something that should be investigated but i have reservations about its use in humans , " he said .

hydrogen sulphide , a toxic gas that smells of rotten eggs , occurs naturally in swamps , springs and volcanoes .
but in mice , it was found to slow down heart rate and breathing and decrease body temperature , while keeping a normal blood pressure .
the results were presented at the american physiology society conference .
in the study carried out at massachusetts general hospital in boston , mice were administered the gas at a concentration of 80 parts per million - a tenth of the dose which is lethal in humans .
the problem with hypothermia is it 's not that easy to cool down the human body so if we can find another method to inhibit metabolism that would be very useful dr fumito ichinose the researchers reported that the heart rate fell from 500 to 200 beats per minute and respiration fell from 120 to 25 breaths per minute .
core body temperature also fell from 39 to 30 degrees c. despite the reduction in heart rate the blood pressure of the mice did not drop , which tends to happen with other techniques such as lowering body temperature .
when the researchers repeated the experiment at a higher room temperature , the heart and respiratory rate still fell significantly .
the effects of the gas seemed to be reversible with the mice returning to normal two hours after the mice started to breathe normal air again .
previous research had shown the ability of hydrogen sulphide to induce a state of hibernation in mice but the effects on the cardiovascular system were unknown .
some anaesthetics and sedatives can be used to slow down metabolism in the brain but currently the only way to protect other organs is to cool the body and induce hypothermia .
trauma patients dr fumito ichinose , assistant professor of anaesthesia at harvard medical school said that if the effects of hydrogen sulphide was confirmed in larger mammals it could be useful in helping to sustain the functionality of organs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or in patients with severe trauma .
" there was a large study published last year of patients who had cardiac arrest .
they kept them in a hypothermic state for a while and the outcome was much better .
" the problem with hypothermia is it 's not that easy to cool down the human body so if we can find another method to inhibit metabolism that would be very useful . "
dr ichinose added that the findings would need to be replicated in larger animals such as pigs as mice may be more susceptible to induced hibernation .
he added that the safety margin was small .
however , he said it was possible that a dose lower than 80 parts per million might also be effective .
but dr chris pomfrett , lecturer in neurophysiology applied to anaesthesia at the university of manchester said further studies were needed to clarify whether the reduced blood pressure and respiration were really associated with hibernation or whether the findings were a result of poisonous effects of the gas .
" my big question about this work is : is it reducing brain metabolism or simply having a toxic effect on the brain stem ?
" although the mice appeared normal they did n't look to see if there was any damage to the mice post-mortem .
" i would also do an electroencephalogram to measure brain activity in the mice . "
he added that there would be lots of problems with using hydrogen sulphide in clinical practice because it was so toxic .
" this is interesting and certainly something that should be investigated but i have reservations about its use in humans , " he said .

epilepsy wales says there are only 14 full-time equivalent neurologists in wales , rather than the 45 there should be , based on population levels .
the welsh assembly government said it was bringing forward plans to improve services , but not until next year .
one expert said people in england would be taken aback by the delay in wales .
phil smith , consultant neurologist in the welsh epilepsy unit at the university hospital of wales , cardiff , told the bbc 's eye on wales programme that a drive to get english waiting lists down had been successful .
but he said the situation was " less impressive " in wales .
" people in england will be surprised to hear that it 's above eight months at the moment .
their waiting times are more like six weeks , " he said .
" we do prioritise people with a first suspected seizure , we expect to see them hopefully within two weeks , but in practice within four or six weeks because of the pressures on the services . "
" it 's hard to get a job while you 're having the seizures " jacqui bate , gwent epilepsy mr smith also felt the public were not very aware of the condition .
" the main thing is that there 's no famous public figure who will acknowledge that they have epilepsy , " he said .
" unfortunately , people in the public eye who are in a position to make a difference choose to conceal it , because they recognise that actually coming out and saying they have epilepsy might jeopardise their chances of progression . "
jacqui bate , chair of gwent epilepsy , was diagnosed with the condition 15 years ago .
she said : " i fall to the floor , i become unconscious and convulse , which is where the body tightens the muscles and shakes .
" i 'm not totally under control at the moment but i can go quite a few months without having a seizure .
" it 's hard to get a job while you 're having the seizures because you ca n't guarantee that you can go into work every day . "
according to epilepsy wales , between 20,000 and 30,000 people in wales have the condition .
' wish list ' the charity has been in discussions with the assembly government for new guidelines and practices .
spokeswoman lesley morris said : " it became fairly evident that the money is not there ; you can not suddenly invent 30 neurologists within 5 years .
" everyone realised that we needed to make a document we can accept and access .
" instead of giving a wish list that 's going to sit on a shelf we 're actually going to have a document that is accessible and achievable . "
a public consultation on epilepsy service development in wales will begin in january .

epilepsy wales says there are only 14 full-time equivalent neurologists in wales , rather than the 45 there should be , based on population levels .
the welsh assembly government said it was bringing forward plans to improve services , but not until next year .
one expert said people in england would be taken aback by the delay in wales .
phil smith , consultant neurologist in the welsh epilepsy unit at the university hospital of wales , cardiff , told the bbc 's eye on wales programme that a drive to get english waiting lists down had been successful .
but he said the situation was " less impressive " in wales .
" people in england will be surprised to hear that it 's above eight months at the moment .
their waiting times are more like six weeks , " he said .
" we do prioritise people with a first suspected seizure , we expect to see them hopefully within two weeks , but in practice within four or six weeks because of the pressures on the services . "
it 's hard to get a job while you 're having the seizures jacqui bate , gwent epilepsy mr smith also felt the public were not very aware of the condition .
" the main thing is that there 's no famous public figure who will acknowledge that they have epilepsy , " he said .
" unfortunately , people in the public eye who are in a position to make a difference choose to conceal it , because they recognise that actually coming out and saying they have epilepsy might jeopardise their chances of progression . "
jacqui bate , chair of gwent epilepsy , was diagnosed with the condition 15 years ago .
she said : " i fall to the floor , i become unconscious and convulse , which is where the body tightens the muscles and shakes .
" i 'm not totally under control at the moment but i can go quite a few months without having a seizure .
" it 's hard to get a job while you 're having the seizures because you ca n't guarantee that you can go into work every day . "
according to epilepsy wales , between 20,000 and 30,000 people in wales have the condition .
' wish list ' the charity has been in discussions with the assembly government for new guidelines and practices .
spokeswoman lesley morris said : " it became fairly evident that the money is not there ; you can not suddenly invent 30 neurologists within 5 years .
" everyone realised that we needed to make a document we can accept and access .
" instead of giving a wish list that 's going to sit on a shelf we 're actually going to have a document that is accessible and achievable . "

fairwood hospital and one ward of hill house could close as part of a £ 12m recovery plan by swansea nhs trust .
swansea local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- deferred a decision on the closures in september .
a unison spokesman said swansea community health council -lrb- chc -rrb- was opposed to the closure and protesters would urge them to keep the same view .
they will voice their opposition when the chc meets at the dylan thomas centre in swansea on monday afternoon .
the original plan to shut fairwood was effectively blocked last year when a 7,000-strong petition opposing it was handed in .
we are prepared to take this fight all the way to the national assembly jeff baker unison however , the trust revived the proposal earlier this year and has been consulting over the summer .
the lhb has proposed setting up alternative services at the city 's singleton hospital and improving services in the community .
it will make its decision at a meeting later this month .
unison regional organiser jeff baker said : " we are pleased in principle that the lhb has extended the consultation period .
" however , we are not at all convinced that the alternative they have put forward will be able to provide the same quality of care that is presently carried out in hill house and fairwood hospitals . "
the union wants the lhb to run the services in parallel so they can be tested for quality of patient care .
" at present the chc is opposed to the closures and we hope that our lobby will persuade them to keep the same view .
" as far as unison is concerned , we are prepared to take this fight all the way to the national assembly -lsb- for wales -rsb- , " said mr baker .
swansea council has also opposed the plan in its current form because it is worried it will place additional pressures on its social services department .

if successful it would be the largest indian takeover of a foreign company and create the world 's fifth-largest steel firm .
last week , tata steel , part of the tata conglomerate , said it was looking at potential takeovers " including corus " .
the sunday telegraph has reported that tata has lined up a £ 3.5bn -lrb- $ 6.5bn -rrb- financing deal for the acquisition .
consolidation rapid economic growth in developing countries including china and india is creating huge demand for steel and many firms are looking to add to their steel-making assets .
but as chinese steel production soars , other manufacturers are trying to consolidate so they can cut costs and stay competitive .
earlier this year mittal steel bought rival arcelor for $ 34bn , creating the world 's biggest steel maker .
tata steel is a small steel producer by global standards , but has the backing of the giant tata group , one of india 's largest companies with interests as diverse as carmaking , communications , tea and oil .
corus was created after british steel merged with dutch firm hoogovens in 1999 and has shed thousands of jobs in recent years .
it employs 47,300 people worldwide and reported a pre-tax profit of £ 580m last year .

the local government association has written to royal mail chief executive adam crozier to make the plea .
the royal mail plans to lift its limit of three items per week of unaddressed mail being delivered to homes .
the lga warned of the impact of junk mail on the environment , and the cost to the tax-payer of disposing of it .
about 78,000 metric tons of junk mail ended up in landfill sites last year .
the chairman of the lga , lord sandy bruce-lockhart said any changes to the current rules were unnecessary .
he said : " the problem is that all of us are throwing away 3 % more waste .
in the last five years the volume of waste we are all throwing away has increased by about 20 % .
' very profitable ' " it 's immensely important for both the environment and for the council tax that we try and cut that down and i think that junk mail is not necessary . "
the royal mail says it only delivers about a quarter of unaddressed mail - such as leaflets from local businesses .
it says its rivals are responsible for the remainder of such deliveries .
as a consequence , the royal mail says any planned changes to the limit - which is currently being discussed with trade unions - would not have a significant effect .
bbc local government correspondent john andrew said : " there is no doubt that this part of their business , although it is a very tiny part of their business , is actually very profitable .
" the royal mail is saying that the profits from that business helps to keep the cost of normal postage down .
they point out that -lsb- the cost of -rsb- posting a first class letter in the uk is the cheapest in the whole of europe . "

the lga warned of the impact of junk mail on the environment , and the cost to the tax-payer of disposing of it .
about 78,000 metric tons of junk mail ended up in landfill sites last year .
the chairman of the lga , lord sandy bruce-lockhart said any changes to the current rules were unnecessary .
he said : " the problem is that all of us are throwing away 3 % more waste .
in the last five years the volume of waste we are all throwing away has increased by about 20 % .
' very profitable ' " it 's immensely important for both the environment and for the council tax that we try and cut that down and i think that junk mail is not necessary . "
the royal mail says it only delivers about a quarter of unaddressed mail - such as leaflets from local businesses .
it says its rivals are responsible for the remainder of such deliveries .
as a consequence , the royal mail says any planned changes to the limit - which is currently being discussed with trade unions - would not have a significant effect .
bbc local government correspondent john andrew said : " there is no doubt that this part of their business , although it is a very tiny part of their business , is actually very profitable .

pcs general secretary mark serwotka said staff had not taken the decision lightly .
he said : " they stand ready , should an emergency situation arise , to temporarily suspend their work-to-rule to ensure the front-line gets the equipment it needs .
" they have grown increasingly dismayed over these plans which will damage the local economies of the sites affected and force families to uproot and move to one of the most expensive areas of the country without any guarantee on job security . "
the merger is part of a continuing efficiency drive , which will cut 10,000 jobs within the mod .
ministers said the co-location would save about £ 200m over the next 25 years .

by nishi bolakee bbc money programme some of the world 's biggest airlines , including our very own british airways , stand accused of ripping off consumers in price fixing conspiracies .
ba has been subject to a dawn raid the office of fair trading in the uk and the department of justice in the us have launched investigations into two alleged conspiracies with a series of dawn raids on airline offices .
competition law bans firms from agreeing prices so that customers benefit from cheaper goods and services as companies compete .
higher prices for goods the first alleged conspiracy concerns the prices of surcharges on cargo shipments .
ba , lufthansa and other major airlines have been accused of agreeing to add some surcharges at exactly the same rate .
the allegations are being investigated by competition authorities throughout the world while american class action lawyers also pursue the airlines in civil suits .
what the air cargo carriers did was raise the prices over and above what they should have been michael hausfeld , class action lawyer at cohen , milstein , hausfeld and toll bruce simon , of class action lawyers cotchett , pitre , simon , and mccarthy , says " it is simply extraordinary , that all the prices were the same at the same time . "
" and of course , one of the allegations is that the prices should n't be the same if the operating costs are different for the airlines , and there 's no economic reason why it should be that way . "
so how does this affect the consumer ?
us lawyers suing for compensation reckon that shippers were forced to pay more for exporting their goods leading to higher prices for products in the shops .
there 's an incentive to any player in the game to blow the whistle michael hausfeld , another class action lawyer from the firm cohen , milstein , hausfeld and toll , says : " they are definitely affecting every consumer literally in most purchases they make .
it all goes into the price . "
" and , what the air cargo carriers did was raise the prices over and above what they should have been . "
recently , lufthansa - the german national carrier , agreed to pay $ 85 million in compensation to shippers to settle with lawyers in the cargo case .
other airlines may follow suit with similar payments and the total compensation bill could top $ 1 billion .
increased cost of flying the second official investigation involves allegations of price-fixing of surcharges on passenger flights .
ba 's offices have been raided , and there is a mystery surrounding ba 's old enemy virgin atlantic , run by renowned consumer champion richard branson , and its role in the affair .
the allegations relate to passenger fuel surcharges which have risen from £ 5 return for long haul flights when they were introduced in may 2004 , to £ 70 from april this year .
they were introduced to help the airlines with the rising cost of fuel .
while virgin 's offices have not been raided by official agencies , richard branson 's company is being sued , along with ba , by class action lawyers in the us who allege that the two companies conspired to fix the price of the surcharges .
immunity ?
" i have nothing to indicate that mr branson , was involved or knows anything about the situation bruce simon , class action lawyer at cotchett , pitre , simon , and mccarthy virgin is said to have played for advantage in the controversy by blowing the whistle and reporting its old adversary to the uk 's office of fair trading .
that could mean that virgin would qualify for immunity in official legal proceedings .
some reports suggest virgin did no more than report an illegal approach by ba although class action lawyers believe it went further .
bruce simon is doubtful that mr branson had any knowledge of a price fixing scheme and says : " i have nothing to indicate that mr branson , was involved or knows anything about the situation .
" those matters do n't have to rise to the level of the board .
they do n't have to rise to the level of a chief executive officer for them to be implemented . "
meanwhile , ba has suspended the number two in the company , commercial director martin george , and its director of communications iain burns .
and on monday ba announced that the two men had resigned .
virgin is being sued along with ba for price-fixing the surcharges have hit consumers like chris and carolyn wood , frequent travellers to the us on both virgin and ba .
four generations of the woods , eight people in total , flew to visit relatives in florida in september .
chris paid for five members of his family to take this trip .
he was shocked to find just how much was added to the price of his tickets to help airlines pay for taxes , airport fees and the rising cost of fuel .
chris says : " i 'd offered to pay for my mother-in-law as a special treat .
i found that in terms of just my cost , which was my two boys , my wife , my mother in law , and myself , we 'd got an extra seven hundred odd pounds or so " .
' dirty tricks ' the current row is the latest chapter in a long history of bitter conflict between the two companies .
jeff randall , editor-at-large of the daily telegraph and former bbc business editor says : " this is yet another delicious chapter in a saga that 's been going on the best part of twenty years . "
if airlines are found to be guilty of price fixing then the consequences could be severe .
pat treacy , a competition lawyer for law firm bristows , says " the legal worst case scenario for ba - the very worst thing that could possibly happen to a company under the law , is that it would be fined 10 % of its global turnover . "
ba 's turnover is around £ 8bn , so the company could be fined £ 800m .
the class action lawyers are seeking yet more huge sums in compensation for customers whom , they allege , have been overcharged .

by nishi bolakee bbc money programme some of the world 's biggest airlines , including our very own british airways , stand accused of ripping off consumers in price fixing conspiracies .
ba has been subject to a dawn raid the office of fair trading in the uk and the department of justice in the us have launched investigations into two alleged conspiracies with a series of dawn raids on airline offices .
competition law bans firms from agreeing prices so that customers benefit from cheaper goods and services as companies compete .
higher prices for goods the first alleged conspiracy concerns the prices of surcharges on cargo shipments .
ba , lufthansa and other major airlines have been accused of agreeing to add some surcharges at exactly the same rate .
the allegations are being investigated by competition authorities throughout the world while american class action lawyers also pursue the airlines in civil suits .
what the air cargo carriers did was raise the prices over and above what they should have been michael hausfeld , class action lawyer at cohen , milstein , hausfeld and toll bruce simon , of class action lawyers cotchett , pitre , simon , and mccarthy , says " it is simply extraordinary , that all the prices were the same at the same time . "
" and of course , one of the allegations is that the prices should n't be the same if the operating costs are different for the airlines , and there 's no economic reason why it should be that way . "
so how does this affect the consumer ?
us lawyers suing for compensation reckon that shippers were forced to pay more for exporting their goods leading to higher prices for products in the shops .
there 's an incentive to any player in the game to blow the whistle michael hausfeld , another class action lawyer from the firm cohen , milstein , hausfeld and toll , says : " they are definitely affecting every consumer literally in most purchases they make .
it all goes into the price . "
" and , what the air cargo carriers did was raise the prices over and above what they should have been . "
recently , lufthansa - the german national carrier , agreed to pay $ 85 million in compensation to shippers to settle with lawyers in the cargo case .
other airlines may follow suit with similar payments and the total compensation bill could top $ 1 billion .
increased cost of flying the second official investigation involves allegations of price-fixing of surcharges on passenger flights .
ba 's offices have been raided , and there is a mystery surrounding ba 's old enemy virgin atlantic , run by renowned consumer champion richard branson , and its role in the affair .
the allegations relate to passenger fuel surcharges which have risen from £ 5 return for long haul flights when they were introduced in may 2004 , to £ 70 from april this year .
they were introduced to help the airlines with the rising cost of fuel .
while virgin 's offices have not been raided by official agencies , richard branson 's company is being sued , along with ba , by class action lawyers in the us who allege that the two companies conspired to fix the price of the surcharges .
immunity ?
" i have nothing to indicate that mr branson , was involved or knows anything about the situation bruce simon , class action lawyer at cotchett , pitre , simon , and mccarthy virgin is said to have played for advantage in the controversy by blowing the whistle and reporting its old adversary to the uk 's office of fair trading .
that could mean that virgin would qualify for immunity in official legal proceedings .
some reports suggest virgin did no more than report an illegal approach by ba although class action lawyers believe it went further .
bruce simon is doubtful that mr branson had any knowledge of a price fixing scheme and says : " i have nothing to indicate that mr branson , was involved or knows anything about the situation .
" those matters do n't have to rise to the level of the board .
they do n't have to rise to the level of a chief executive officer for them to be implemented . "
meanwhile , ba has suspended the number two in the company , commercial director martin george , and its director of communications iain burns .
and on monday ba announced that the two men had resigned .
virgin is being sued along with ba for price-fixing the surcharges have hit consumers like chris and carolyn wood , frequent travellers to the us on both virgin and ba .

chris paid for five members of his family to take this trip .
he was shocked to find just how much was added to the price of his tickets to help airlines pay for taxes , airport fees and the rising cost of fuel .
chris says : " i 'd offered to pay for my mother-in-law as a special treat .
i found that in terms of just my cost , which was my two boys , my wife , my mother in law , and myself , we 'd got an extra seven hundred odd pounds or so " .

baby caleb was the only child to arrive during the two-hour broadcast from the queen 's medical centre in nottingham .
sunday night 's show , which had hoped to capture a live natural birth , had been branded " risky " by the national childbirth trust .
but a five spokeswoman said it had been " a huge success " with a " smooth " birth .
this is such a wonderful moment .
sorry , i 'm quite emotional co-presenter andrew castle on caleb 's birth producers had been following several expectant mothers in the days leading up to the programme .
and one of them - a midwife from the same hospital - did give birth naturally a few minutes before it began .
a heavily-pregnant woman , who was minutes away from a natural birth when the show ended , also featured .
presenter penny lancaster , who is the partner of singer rod stewart , was seen helping her through her contractions .
andrew castle , the co-host who covered the birth of 6lb -lrb- 2.7kg -rrb- caleb , was visibly moved as he was delivered .
penny lancaster , who has a 10-month old son , was a guest host " this is such a wonderful moment , " he told viewers .
" sorry , i 'm quite emotional . "
five had promised to withdraw filming if there was any indication of danger to a mother or child .
it followed a warning by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists that there was no way to guarantee the " calm environment " deserved by a mother and child .
the show had also been described as " irresponsible , unnecessary and unduly risky " by the national childbirth trust .
the attempt to show the first live birth on uk television came five years after us network abc showed five such deliveries on its programme super baby tuesday .

the talks with gerry sutcliffe follow months of campaigning from locals .
seven prisoners have absconded from the monmouthshire jail since july , including child rapists and a murderer .
the home office said all prisoners moved to open prisons like prescoed were carefully vetted beforehand to ensure they were no danger .
but people in the town are worried the government will use open prisons for more serious offenders as jails across the uk reach full capacity .
welsh social justice minister edwina hart and former home office minister alun michael have expressed concerns over the amount of prisoners who have gone on the run .
panic calls the seven absconders since july have included child sex offenders john elms and martin aspinall , and murderer lee dewhurst .
all three were caught and returned to prison .
lee dewhurst was recently found hanged in his cell in bristol prison .
usk nursery group chair kate parish said parents in the town are terrified every time they hear a police helicopter .
" when the helicopter starts circling overhead , which has been a regular occurrence over the summer , suddenly there 's phone calls from mother to mother , father to father ... and it is panic , " she said .
there is a crisis in confidence in the prison in prescoed usk town councillor tony kear " i wo n't go on local walks now with the pushchair or the children on my own , simply for the fear that somebody has escaped from prescoed . "
usk town councillor tony kear said he welcomed the prison minister 's statement this weekend that violent or sexual offenders should not be moved from category c to category d , or open , prisons .
he said councillors had been arguing this point for more than two years .
" i think what we 've got here is an opportunity to press home the real fears that are in the community .
kate parish accurately sums up what 's going on here at the moment .
" there is a crisis in confidence in the prison in prescoed , " mr kear said .
" we do n't have an issue at all about it being an open prison .
it 's been there since 1939 and to our minds it is about rehabilitation .
" it has a place in society .
but not for convicted sex offenders and particularly child rapists who are the ones who have absconded . "
the home office said some of the absconders from prescoed involved prisoners out on licence who simply did not return .

the anti-immigrant vlaams belang -lrb- flemish interest -rrb- party won about 20 % of the vote in dutch-speaking flanders .
however it was knocked from first to second place in its traditional heartland - the city of antwerp .
in the past other parties have formed coalitions to keep vlaams belang out of power , even where it has come first .
they are expected to try to do the same again .
protest vote vlaams belang campaigns on a platform of independence for flanders , the richer dutch-speaking part of belgium , and an anti-immigration integrationist stance towards minorities .
but it is perhaps primarily a place for the protest vote , for people to register their dissatisfaction with the long-standing political status quo , says the bbc 's jonny dymond in brussels .
the status quo seems to be unpopular at the moment , he adds , with the far right making what it calls " spectacular " gains .
the lead party of the national coalition - the liberal democrats - has seen its share of the vote slip away .
" this is a landslide victory , " said vlaams belang party chairman frank vanhecke .
however , there was some consolation for the mainstream parties in antwerp , the home of vlaams belang , where it suffered its only significant setback .
even though it increased its share of the city 's vote to 33.5 % , it was overtaken by the socialists , inspired by their popular mayor patrick janssens , who made dramatic gains to 35.3 % .
" it shows that it is possible to stop vlaams belang with a positive project , " mr janssens said .
socialists suffer belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt acknowledged the scale of his party 's defeat , with less than a year to go before parliamentary elections .
" the average trend of the flemish liberal democrats is not so good , " he said .
" we must acknowledge that the government has had a few bad months and we know that whoever leads faces the most fire . "
meanwhile , in wallonia , the french-speaking part of belgium , mr verhofstadt 's coalition partners , the socialists , lost ground badly .
the party , embroiled in a corruption scandal , was forced to give up seats in the cities of charleroi , namur , and liege .
the christian democrats were the biggest winners there .

the anti-immigrant vlaams belang -lrb- flemish interest -rrb- party won about 20 % of the vote in dutch-speaking flanders .
however it was knocked from first to second place in its traditional heartland - the city of antwerp .
in the past other parties have formed coalitions to keep vlaams belang out of power , even where it has come first .
they are expected to try to do the same again .
protest vote vlaams belang campaigns on a platform of independence for flanders , the richer dutch-speaking part of belgium , and an anti-immigration integrationist stance towards minorities .
but it is perhaps primarily a place for the protest vote , for people to register their dissatisfaction with the long-standing political status quo , says the bbc 's jonny dymond in brussels .
guy verhofstadt acknowledged the scale of his party 's defeat the status quo seems to be unpopular at the moment , he adds , with the far right making what it calls " spectacular " gains .
the lead party of the national coalition - the liberal democrats - has seen its share of the vote slip away .
" this is a landslide victory , " said vlaams belang party chairman frank vanhecke .
however , there was some consolation for the mainstream parties in antwerp , the home of vlaams belang , where it suffered its only significant setback .
even though it increased its share of the city 's vote to 33.5 % , it was overtaken by the socialists , inspired by their popular mayor patrick janssens , who made dramatic gains to 35.3 % .
" it shows that it is possible to stop vlaams belang with a positive project , " mr janssens said .
socialists suffer belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt acknowledged the scale of his party 's defeat , with less than a year to go before parliamentary elections .
" the average trend of the flemish liberal democrats is not so good , " he said .

the national trust for scotland -lrb- nts -rrb- hopes to attract two new families to canna in the hebrides .
the trust , which owns the most westerly of the small isles , said it has 15 inhabitants left .
in an effort to reverse the decline , nts is offering two of its properties for rent .
alex lindsay , nts director for the highlands and islands , said applicants should be eager to play an active role in the community . "
it is hoped that bringing in new residents will contribute to the safeguarding of the school , community and economy of the island " alex lindsay nts he said : " we are very keen to hear from families who wish to take up the opportunity to live and work on canna .
" it is hoped that bringing in new residents will contribute to the safeguarding of the school , community and economy of the island , whilst increasing the skills base and making a valuable contribution to island life . "
nts said there were potential employment opportunities on the island for people with building , gardening , electrics or plumbing skills .
employment on canna is mainly associated with agriculture in the traditional farming of sheep and cattle together with crofting .
tourism also plays a role with about 30,000 people visiting every year .
until now it has been canna 's wildlife that has given nts most cause for concern .
a rat extermination programme was introduced after it was found that the predators were eating eggs and bird chicks .
the mammals are thought to have been completely wiped out and seabirds such as shag , razorbills and manx shearwater are showing signs of recovery .
wood mice were removed from the island so they were not exterminated along with the rats .
earlier this year , 150 mice were returned to canna after being looked after at edinburgh zoo and highland wildlife park .

" it is hoped that bringing in new residents will contribute to the safeguarding of the school , community and economy of the island , whilst increasing the skills base and making a valuable contribution to island life . "
nts said there were potential employment opportunities on the island for people with building , gardening , electrics or plumbing skills .
employment on canna is mainly associated with agriculture in the traditional farming of sheep and cattle together with crofting .
one of the two houses available for rent on canna tourism also plays a role with about 30,000 people visiting every year .
until now it has been canna 's wildlife that has given nts most cause for concern .
a rat extermination programme was introduced after it was found that the predators were eating eggs and bird chicks .
the mammals are thought to have been completely wiped out and seabirds such as shag , razorbills and manx shearwater are showing signs of recovery .
wood mice were removed from the island so they were not exterminated along with the rats .
earlier this year , 150 mice were returned to canna after being looked after at edinburgh zoo and highland wildlife park .

ban ki-moon is likely to concentrate on being a good administrator the mild-mannered public servant and politician from south korea - he is currently its foreign minister - will , therefore , differ from the present secretary general kofi annan , who retires at the end of the year .
mr annan has sought to make the un more interventionist in world crises but his neglect of the un organisation landed him in trouble when corruption and maladministration was revealed in the oil-for-food programme for iraq .
" ban ki-moon is low-key and consensual .
these are not bad qualities and one can not judge a secretary general in advance , " said lord -lrb- david -rrb- hannay , formerly britain 's un ambassador and a member of a high-level panel that called for un reform .
" he was the best in a thin field which was restricted because of the requirement to have the candidates from asia this time .
" but in any event , the secretary general of the un does not get a honeymoon .
he gets a baptism of fire . "
influence of major powers the choice of ban ki-moon seems to reflect a desire among the leading powers for the un to take a back seat .
the united states , which almost came to blows with kofi annan over iraq , has emphasised the secretary general 's role as the un 's chief administrator .
the chinese are still themselves playing a quiet role at the un and have spoken warmly of their south korean colleague , so presumably they favour his similarly quiet approach .
the other permanent security council members , russia , britain and france , also seem happy to have someone who is unlikely to cause too many waves .
broadly , ban ki-moon has two main challenges .
the first is internal and the second external .
internal un reform internally , he has to take un reforms further .
his problem here is that it is not only the powerful nations that might not want too active a secretary general .
efforts to give the office more power over the bureaucracy had only limited success last year when the general assembly , where the bulk of countries are represented , objected to major changes .
this means that the secretary general will still have his hands somewhat tied on the appointment and removal of many un diplomats .
the new un chief will have to deal with possible sanctions over iran getting that aspect of reform through will test mr ban 's manners to the full .
but he also needs to decide what priorities to set for the organisation , for example , how hard to push the millennium development goals and how to direct the peace-building commission that the reform panel called for as a way of trying to avoid crises in the future .
he is expected to appoint a deputy who might play a more forceful role than deputies have in the past .
thorsten benner , of the global public policy institute in berlin and author of a forthcoming book about the un , wrote in the international herald tribune : " ban ran a skilful campaign in which he advocated the right approach for turning the un into an effective , accountable and transparent global organization .
" ban is right on target when he asserts that the ' strategic focus should be more on achieving the goals already set rather than identifying new frontiers to conquer . " '
external un role externally , he faces an immediate crisis over north korea which announced its nuclear test on the day that mr ban 's name was due to come before the security council .
obviously his south korean background gives him special insights into the issue but equally he will have to show an even-handed approach .
there are also crises over the un 's potential intervention in darfur , over possible sanctions against iran and as always the middle east .
the consensus-building skills that go with his kind of profile might eventually put him a position to do some heavy lifting francois heisbourg , foundation for strategic research it is likely that he will seek to work behind the scenes more than on the television sets .
francois heisbourg , of the foundation for strategic research in paris , said : " the consensus-building skills that go with his kind of profile might eventually put him a position to do some heavy lifting .
" do n't mistake asian mild manners for a lack of steel . "
the reform on which lord hannay sat recommended that the un adopt the principle of the " responsibility to protect " .
this was agreed in a statement from the un as a whole but its implementation has yet to be tested .
" if the people of darfur can not be protected , " said lord hannay , " then the responsibility to protect will look pretty sick .
" the secretary general has to play a key role .
china and russia are dragging their feet , china perhaps because it has not really made its mind up about what place it wants in the world .
ban is close to china and that might help . "

ban ki-moon is likely to concentrate on being a good administrator the mild-mannered public servant and politician from south korea - he is currently its foreign minister - will , therefore , differ from the present secretary general kofi annan , who retires at the end of the year .
mr annan has sought to make the un more interventionist in world crises but his neglect of the un organisation landed him in trouble when corruption and maladministration was revealed in the oil-for-food programme for iraq .
" ban ki-moon is low-key and consensual .
these are not bad qualities and one can not judge a secretary general in advance , " said lord -lrb- david -rrb- hannay , formerly britain 's un ambassador and a member of a high-level panel that called for un reform .
" he was the best in a thin field which was restricted because of the requirement to have the candidates from asia this time .
" but in any event , the secretary general of the un does not get a honeymoon .
he gets a baptism of fire . "
influence of major powers the choice of ban ki-moon seems to reflect a desire among the leading powers for the un to take a back seat .
the united states , which almost came to blows with kofi annan over iraq , has emphasised the secretary general 's role as the un 's chief administrator .
the chinese are still themselves playing a quiet role at the un and have spoken warmly of their south korean colleague , so presumably they favour his similarly quiet approach .
the other permanent security council members , russia , britain and france , also seem happy to have someone who is unlikely to cause too many waves .
broadly , ban ki-moon has two main challenges .
the first is internal and the second external .
internal un reform internally , he has to take un reforms further .
his problem here is that it is not only the powerful nations that might not want too active a secretary general .
efforts to give the office more power over the bureaucracy had only limited success last year when the general assembly , where the bulk of countries are represented , objected to major changes .
this means that the secretary general will still have his hands somewhat tied on the appointment and removal of many un diplomats .
the new un chief will have to deal with possible sanctions over iran getting that aspect of reform through will test mr ban 's manners to the full .
but he also needs to decide what priorities to set for the organisation , for example , how hard to push the millennium development goals and how to direct the peace-building commission that the reform panel called for as a way of trying to avoid crises in the future .
he is expected to appoint a deputy who might play a more forceful role than deputies have in the past .
thorsten benner , of the global public policy institute in berlin and author of a forthcoming book about the un , wrote in the international herald tribune : " ban ran a skilful campaign in which he advocated the right approach for turning the un into an effective , accountable and transparent global organization .
" ban is right on target when he asserts that the ' strategic focus should be more on achieving the goals already set rather than identifying new frontiers to conquer . " '
external un role externally , he faces an immediate crisis over north korea which announced its nuclear test on the day that mr ban 's name was due to come before the security council .
obviously his south korean background gives him special insights into the issue but equally he will have to show an even-handed approach .
there are also crises over the un 's potential intervention in darfur , over possible sanctions against iran and as always the middle east .

the two - commercial director martin george and communications chief iain burns - have been on leave of absence since the probe began in june .
the uk office of fair trading and the us department of justice are looking at claims that ba had been informing other airlines of its fuel surcharge plans .
ba admitted it had contacted a competitor over fuel surcharges .
breach of policy in a letter to ba chairman martin broughton , mr george said there may have been " inappropriate conversations " in his office over long-haul fuel surcharges , although he said he was not involved in " such conversations " . "
contact took place with a competitor in respect of long-haul passenger fuel surcharges , in breach of the company 's compliance policy " british airways statement the great plane robbery ?
q & a : ba investigation he added : " although the board have not found that i have behaved in a dishonest way , i fully recognise my responsibilities as head of department and as a board director . "
reports have said that a ba executive told a counterpart from rival airline virgin atlantic of plans to increase ba 's fuel surcharge , and that virgin then tipped off the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- .
british airways has conducted an internal investigation in order to respond to the requests for information made by the regulators .
in a statement issued on monday it admitted that " contact took place with a competitor in respect of long-haul passenger fuel surcharges , in breach of the company 's compliance policy " .
it added that it was still assisting the regulators with their investigations .
the oft said its investigations into british airways were still continuing .
if found guilty of anti-competitive behaviour , ba could be fined up to 10 % of its worldwide sales , which came in at £ 8.5bn for the year to 31 march .
last february , ba and a number of other airlines , including lufthansa , singapore airlines and sas , were investigated by the european commission and us competition authorities .
that inquiry was believed to focus on the area of fuel surcharges and other levies for cargo handling .
