germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .
it has been imposed in order to defeat terrorism and to protect our public and that is what the three ministers have as our highest priority , " reid said . britain has said it is currently holding 24 people in custody in connection with the alleged plot .
the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened . " the french interior minister recalled that " a heightened threat " of terrorist attack remained in france " even if at the moment we speak , there is no known link with what could have happened in britain . " in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .
controversy over a mock crucifixion during the concert has dogged the tour so far , and the german regulators will be watching in an attempt to determine whether the scene could be construed as insulting religious beliefs . nailed on a " disco cross " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madonna pole-dancing in a skin-tight catsuit : a less provocative scene from her current show during the offensive section , madonna is hoisted onto what can be loosely termed a " disco cross " while wearing a crown of thorns .
the mock crucifixion has caused outrage in many of the countries in which the singer has performed during the tour to date . the vatican is especially upset .
cardinal ersilio tonino , speaking with the approval of the pope , recently called the concert " a blasphemous challenge to the faith " and a " profanation of the cross " after madonna had played rome .
he also called for madonna , who was raised as a catholic , to be excommunicated . madonna in blasphemy row - again " it is disrespectful , in bad taste and provocative , " added father manfredo leone from rome 's santa maria liberatrice church .
" being raised on a cross with a crown of thorns like a modern christ is absurd .
doing it in the cradle of christianity comes close to blasphemy . " the scene has also offended jewish and muslim leaders . " it is an idea in the worst possible taste and she would be better to return home , " suggested mario scajola , head of the italian muslim league , after the rome show . russia 's orthodox church accused madonna of exploiting christian symbols for her own ends and called for a boycott of her first-ever concert in moscow , when she played there earlier this month . " the us singer madonna exploits christian symbols - the cross , rosary beads and the crucifix - and tries to equate human passions , including her own personal passions , with something sacred , " the spokesman for the patriarch of moscow said in a statement . not disrespectful to church ... but world leaders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few moms can pull this off the singer 's spokeswoman , liz rosenberg , issued a statement in defense of the singer , denying that the star 's show was insulting .
" the context of madonna 's performance on the crucifix is neither negative nor disrespectful toward the church , " she said . the german authorities will make up their own minds on the crucifixion matter this weekend and also on whether the giant screen , which flashes images ranging from the pope , osama bin laden , us president george w. bush , chinese leader mao zedong to italian fascist dictator benito mussolini , is in bad taste . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politician 's blasphemy plan gets cool reception bavaria 's conservative premier stoiber recently proposed tightening germany 's blasphemy laws .

" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement last month . in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany is believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wal-mart 's germany ceo david wild , who is from england , said in a recent newspaper interview .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " first ear n i n gs decli n e i n a decade the earnings decline was wal-mart 's first since early 1996 , which itself was the company 's first profit fall since it started trading as a public company in 1970 . the retailer also announced in the past quarter that it was selling its 16 stores in south korea , but it did not mention any material impact from this in its earnings statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart was disappointed with its us sales too " these changes allow us to continue to focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact on wal-mart 's growth and our roi -lrb- return on investment -rrb- strategy , " company chief executive lee scott said .
" we are , however , quite honestly disappointed in the sales performance of wal-mart us .
some of the same issues affecting our customers , such as higher utility costs and gas -lrb- gasoline -rrb- prices , are impacting corporations like wal-mart as well . " despite the hefty charge in germany , wal-mart stuck to its earnings targets for the 2006-2007 fiscal year . it predicted it would earn $ 2.88-2.95 per share over the 12 months , against wall street 's forecast of $ 2.92 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest retailer wal-mart closes up shop in germany retailing giant wal-mart is bidding auf wiedersehen to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.08.2006 new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jögi löw keeps faith with his young stars and the master plan for germany 's future joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden . it was probably the most perfect ten minutes of the 2006 world cup .
with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .
" miroslav klose and lukas podolski will start against sweden , " löw said at a press conference on sunday .
" it was a partnership that worked well at the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw sticks with germany 's world cup strike force klose scored five goals at the world cup while the 21-year-old podolski scored three times . sweden should need no firing up for the match with their 2-0 defeat in the world cup still fresh in their memory .

but can they stop a desperate hotel owner from jumping through legal loopholes to give it away ? a financially hard-up hotel owner in delmenhorst announced late tuesday he may give away his 100-room facility as a gift to neo-nazi jürgen rieger . rieger , a lawyer who has defended prominent ex-nazis and is active in the neo-nazi scene , was planning to purchase the hotel for 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- and turn it into a conference center for right-extremist gatherings and events . he has encountered fierce resistance from the residents of the small northern german town of 80,000 people , who have not only staged protests but also raised more than 730,000 euros in an effort to buy back the hotel themselves . the case , however , is a legal maze . city adds hotel to redevelopme n t area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger has been a speaker at rallies in remembrance of hitler 's deputy rudolf hess after desperately searching for a solution that was satisfactory to the city 's residents and fell with the bounds of the law , the town of delmenhorst officially enlarged the downtown renovation area .
the hotel , located just minutes from the main train station , now falls within space intended for redevelopment . redrawing the lines automatically gave the town a preemptive right to purchase the building at price defined by a neutral third party . hotel owner günter mergel threw a new loophole into the process when he announced that he plans to give the hotel to the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization .
rieger oversees the organization , which was founded by and named after a wealthy ex-nazi from bremen . giving away the hotel , in the legal sense , would effectively " annul the city 's right to buy first , " said the owner of the hotel , which has stood empty for 14 months . a gift with a price tag naturally , mergel 's proposed gift comes with strings attached .

certainly reason to be happy for bernd schneider .
but afterwards it was time for the man with the golden boot - miroslav klose .
the top goalscorer at the world cup , klose struck in the 8th minute after adroitly avoiding two defenders and sliding the ball under unlucky swedish keeper rami shabaan .
it was deja vu in gelsenkirchen .
germany were up 2-0 early .
the swedes offered little resistance either defensively or up front , and just before the interval , klose sealed the contest with his most potent weapon , a header against which shabaan had no chance .
euphoria still in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 82 million fans still clearly behind the " new " team in most post-match interviews , the german players spoke of how they felt the euphoria that was omnipresent during the world cup , and it was unmistakable at the arena auf schalke .

they listed germany 's priorities as helping to implement the resolution , to broker lasting peace in the middle east and to rebuild lebanon in the wake of the month-long israeli offensive against hezbollah militia .
germany wants to help " the coalition agrees that germany wants to make a contribution to solving the political problems in the middle east , " they said in a joint statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and co , seem to be in agreement the meeting consisted of merkel , who leads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , social democratic party leader kurt beck and deputy chancellor franz müntefering , also a social democrat . government spokesman thomas steg said earlier that germany wanted to know more about the mandate of the un force before committing itself to contributing soldiers . " many questions are still open .
germany is prepared to make a contribution if there is a clear definition .
it depends on certain factors and these factors are still unclear , " he said .
difficult subject a decision is widely expected to be made this week .
several german ministers have said that the country can not refuse to take part in the peacekeeping force , but the issue is fraught because of the country 's nazi past .
germany 's central council of jews has warned that sending troops to the middle east 60 years after the murder of six million jews poses a moral dilemma . a ceasefire took effect in lebanon on monday , following a un resolution which paves the way for the deployment of the international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers : germany prepared to take part in lebanon mission if germany were asked to participate in an international peacekeeping mission in lebanon , it could not refuse , two top level german ministers said on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 16.08.2006 germans too hot for sex this summer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems that nobody was rolling in the hay this summer in germany one of the rarely discussed consequences of global warming is the catastrophic effect it may have on the sexual practices of northern europeans . germany got two blessings this summer : a wildly successful world cup and a hot , sunny summer .
thanks to the combination of mass-released endorphins and global warming , germany is no longer believed to be a boring country of obsessive-compulsive busy-bees , but rather a northern mediterranean paradise of party animals and politicians who spend most of their time jumping up and down in soccer stadiums . unfortunately , we 're only now beginning to learn about the other side of the medal .
the world cup lasted four weeks , but the hot weather persisted even longer - with disastrous consequences for germany 's sex life . apparently , germans simply do n't get hot for love when it 's sizzling hot outside .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .
it has been imposed in order to defeat terrorism and to protect our public and that is what the three ministers have as our highest priority , " reid said . britain has said it is currently holding 24 people in custody in connection with the alleged plot .
the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened . " the french interior minister recalled that " a heightened threat " of terrorist attack remained in france " even if at the moment we speak , there is no known link with what could have happened in britain . " in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

security experts say there are serious deficits . like most jittery european capitals , berlin rushed to beef up security last week after britain said it had thwarted bomb attacks on transatlantic airliners . the sense of panic has given way to a debate on security , fueled by reports that one of the arrested suspects in london had a link to hamburg , where three of the sept .
11 , 2001 suicide bombers had lived . though politicians are split on boosting existing counter-terrorism legislation , there is agreement across the board that germany is well-equipped to deal with terrorism . " huge deficits " the view is at sharp odds to assessments by security experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's beefed up security in the wake of the madrid bombings in 2004 " germany has huge deficits , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" almost five years after the sept .
11 attacks , not much is left of the anti-terrorism package , germany still has n't signed on to the eu-wide arrest warrant system and the surveillance of residences and communication systems has become increasingly difficult . " germany began putting together its counter-terrorism package in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 .
over the years , it 's been cautiously beefed up to include laws making it easier to deport those preaching jihad as well as giving intelligence agencies access to telephone and bank data . the german parliament recently extended the legislation by another five years . " variety of useless tools " but , experts are n't so sure about the effectiveness of many of the measures .

thanks to the combination of mass-released endorphins and global warming , germany is no longer believed to be a boring country of obsessive-compulsive busy-bees , but rather a northern mediterranean paradise of party animals and politicians who spend most of their time jumping up and down in soccer stadiums . unfortunately , we 're only now beginning to learn about the other side of the medal .
the world cup lasted four weeks , but the hot weather persisted even longer - with disastrous consequences for germany 's sex life . apparently , germans simply do n't get hot for love when it 's sizzling hot outside .
they just do n't have the brazilian stamina for that kind of thing .
which is exactly why germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , beate uhse , announced disappointing results for the first half of 2005 . unfulfilled desires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hot weather has been bad for business " because the summer has been so hot , we got to feel the consumers ' disinclination to buy , " said management spokeman otto christian lindemann on monday . the company revenues fell by 138.5 million euros -lrb- $ 176.5 million -rrb- - almost five percent - when compared to the same period in 2005 .
" our expectations remain , therefore , unfulfilled . " after weeks of frustrated financial and erotic expectations , however , germany experienced a significant temperature drop in august .
it is only to be hoped that the saharan temperatures did not leave a permanent mark on the german psyche . therefore , dear german friends , it 's time to stand up for your weather preferences and say an even louder " no " to global warming .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .
i do n't see any innocents under the sun .
please , stop the polemics : we must try to build a new european way of life .
some forces do n't like and do n't want a strong , really independent european union .
every day , someone blows on the fire of our errors of the past decades and centuries .
do you remember the latin motto " divide et impera ? "
please , european citizens , do n't fall again in the traps of the past ! - marco complied by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish press review : ' exhibit hurtful to polish-german relations ' the polish press generally responded with indignation , tempered with some degree of understanding , to the controversial berlin exhibit on people expelled from their homes after world war ii .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life .

it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .

the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened .

" in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.08.2006 new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jögi löw keeps faith with his young stars and the master plan for germany 's future joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden . it was probably the most perfect ten minutes of the 2006 world cup .
with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .
" miroslav klose and lukas podolski will start against sweden , " löw said at a press conference on sunday .
" it was a partnership that worked well at the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw sticks with germany 's world cup strike force klose scored five goals at the world cup while the 21-year-old podolski scored three times . sweden should need no firing up for the match with their 2-0 defeat in the world cup still fresh in their memory .
like germany they are also warming up for the euro 2008 qualifiers with their first match against latvia on september 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann holds the door open for löw for two years , joachim löw has silently stood in the shadows of a more effervescent jürgen klinsmann .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .
controversy over a mock crucifixion during the concert has dogged the tour so far , and the german regulators will be watching in an attempt to determine whether the scene could be construed as insulting religious beliefs . nailed on a " disco cross " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madonna pole-dancing in a skin-tight catsuit : a less provocative scene from her current show during the offensive section , madonna is hoisted onto what can be loosely termed a " disco cross " while wearing a crown of thorns .
the mock crucifixion has caused outrage in many of the countries in which the singer has performed during the tour to date . the vatican is especially upset .
cardinal ersilio tonino , speaking with the approval of the pope , recently called the concert " a blasphemous challenge to the faith " and a " profanation of the cross " after madonna had played rome .
he also called for madonna , who was raised as a catholic , to be excommunicated . madonna in blasphemy row - again " it is disrespectful , in bad taste and provocative , " added father manfredo leone from rome 's santa maria liberatrice church .
" being raised on a cross with a crown of thorns like a modern christ is absurd .
doing it in the cradle of christianity comes close to blasphemy . " the scene has also offended jewish and muslim leaders . " it is an idea in the worst possible taste and she would be better to return home , " suggested mario scajola , head of the italian muslim league , after the rome show . russia 's orthodox church accused madonna of exploiting christian symbols for her own ends and called for a boycott of her first-ever concert in moscow , when she played there earlier this month . " the us singer madonna exploits christian symbols - the cross , rosary beads and the crucifix - and tries to equate human passions , including her own personal passions , with something sacred , " the spokesman for the patriarch of moscow said in a statement . not disrespectful to church ... but world leaders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few moms can pull this off the singer 's spokeswoman , liz rosenberg , issued a statement in defense of the singer , denying that the star 's show was insulting .
" the context of madonna 's performance on the crucifix is neither negative nor disrespectful toward the church , " she said . the german authorities will make up their own minds on the crucifixion matter this weekend and also on whether the giant screen , which flashes images ranging from the pope , osama bin laden , us president george w. bush , chinese leader mao zedong to italian fascist dictator benito mussolini , is in bad taste . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politician 's blasphemy plan gets cool reception bavaria 's conservative premier stoiber recently proposed tightening germany 's blasphemy laws .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .

the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .

per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .
controversy over a mock crucifixion during the concert has dogged the tour so far , and the german regulators will be watching in an attempt to determine whether the scene could be construed as insulting religious beliefs . nailed on a " disco cross " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madonna pole-dancing in a skin-tight catsuit : a less provocative scene from her current show during the offensive section , madonna is hoisted onto what can be loosely termed a " disco cross " while wearing a crown of thorns .
the mock crucifixion has caused outrage in many of the countries in which the singer has performed during the tour to date . the vatican is especially upset .
cardinal ersilio tonino , speaking with the approval of the pope , recently called the concert " a blasphemous challenge to the faith " and a " profanation of the cross " after madonna had played rome .
he also called for madonna , who was raised as a catholic , to be excommunicated . madonna in blasphemy row - again " it is disrespectful , in bad taste and provocative , " added father manfredo leone from rome 's santa maria liberatrice church .
" being raised on a cross with a crown of thorns like a modern christ is absurd .
doing it in the cradle of christianity comes close to blasphemy . " the scene has also offended jewish and muslim leaders . " it is an idea in the worst possible taste and she would be better to return home , " suggested mario scajola , head of the italian muslim league , after the rome show . russia 's orthodox church accused madonna of exploiting christian symbols for her own ends and called for a boycott of her first-ever concert in moscow , when she played there earlier this month . " the us singer madonna exploits christian symbols - the cross , rosary beads and the crucifix - and tries to equate human passions , including her own personal passions , with something sacred , " the spokesman for the patriarch of moscow said in a statement . not disrespectful to church ... but world leaders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few moms can pull this off the singer 's spokeswoman , liz rosenberg , issued a statement in defense of the singer , denying that the star 's show was insulting .
" the context of madonna 's performance on the crucifix is neither negative nor disrespectful toward the church , " she said . the german authorities will make up their own minds on the crucifixion matter this weekend and also on whether the giant screen , which flashes images ranging from the pope , osama bin laden , us president george w. bush , chinese leader mao zedong to italian fascist dictator benito mussolini , is in bad taste . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politician 's blasphemy plan gets cool reception bavaria 's conservative premier stoiber recently proposed tightening germany 's blasphemy laws .

they listed germany 's priorities as helping to implement the resolution , to broker lasting peace in the middle east and to rebuild lebanon in the wake of the month-long israeli offensive against hezbollah militia .
germany wants to help " the coalition agrees that germany wants to make a contribution to solving the political problems in the middle east , " they said in a joint statement .

" many questions are still open .
germany is prepared to make a contribution if there is a clear definition .
it depends on certain factors and these factors are still unclear , " he said .
difficult subject a decision is widely expected to be made this week .

but can they stop a desperate hotel owner from jumping through legal loopholes to give it away ? a financially hard-up hotel owner in delmenhorst announced late tuesday he may give away his 100-room facility as a gift to neo-nazi jürgen rieger . rieger , a lawyer who has defended prominent ex-nazis and is active in the neo-nazi scene , was planning to purchase the hotel for 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- and turn it into a conference center for right-extremist gatherings and events . he has encountered fierce resistance from the residents of the small northern german town of 80,000 people , who have not only staged protests but also raised more than 730,000 euros in an effort to buy back the hotel themselves . the case , however , is a legal maze . city adds hotel to redevelopme n t area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger has been a speaker at rallies in remembrance of hitler 's deputy rudolf hess after desperately searching for a solution that was satisfactory to the city 's residents and fell with the bounds of the law , the town of delmenhorst officially enlarged the downtown renovation area .
the hotel , located just minutes from the main train station , now falls within space intended for redevelopment . redrawing the lines automatically gave the town a preemptive right to purchase the building at price defined by a neutral third party . hotel owner günter mergel threw a new loophole into the process when he announced that he plans to give the hotel to the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .
it has been imposed in order to defeat terrorism and to protect our public and that is what the three ministers have as our highest priority , " reid said . britain has said it is currently holding 24 people in custody in connection with the alleged plot .
the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened . " the french interior minister recalled that " a heightened threat " of terrorist attack remained in france " even if at the moment we speak , there is no known link with what could have happened in britain . " in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement last month . in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany is believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wal-mart 's germany ceo david wild , who is from england , said in a recent newspaper interview .

but can they stop a desperate hotel owner from jumping through legal loopholes to give it away ? a financially hard-up hotel owner in delmenhorst announced late tuesday he may give away his 100-room facility as a gift to neo-nazi jürgen rieger . rieger , a lawyer who has defended prominent ex-nazis and is active in the neo-nazi scene , was planning to purchase the hotel for 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- and turn it into a conference center for right-extremist gatherings and events . he has encountered fierce resistance from the residents of the small northern german town of 80,000 people , who have not only staged protests but also raised more than 730,000 euros in an effort to buy back the hotel themselves . the case , however , is a legal maze . city adds hotel to redevelopme n t area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger has been a speaker at rallies in remembrance of hitler 's deputy rudolf hess after desperately searching for a solution that was satisfactory to the city 's residents and fell with the bounds of the law , the town of delmenhorst officially enlarged the downtown renovation area .
the hotel , located just minutes from the main train station , now falls within space intended for redevelopment . redrawing the lines automatically gave the town a preemptive right to purchase the building at price defined by a neutral third party . hotel owner günter mergel threw a new loophole into the process when he announced that he plans to give the hotel to the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization .
rieger oversees the organization , which was founded by and named after a wealthy ex-nazi from bremen . giving away the hotel , in the legal sense , would effectively " annul the city 's right to buy first , " said the owner of the hotel , which has stood empty for 14 months . a gift with a price tag naturally , mergel 's proposed gift comes with strings attached .
according to news reports , the foundation would take over his hefty debts and pay the gift tax on the building .
here 's the catch : it would also purchase the hotel 's inventory for a convenient 3.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disputed hotel in delmenhorst mergel defended this option as a way to avoid drawn-out negotiations with the town , which he accused of consistently not responding to complaints of noise disturbance surrounding his centrally located building , reported the daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger . some suspect , however , that the hotel owner expects the deal will bring in a great deal more cash than if he gave in to protestors ' wishes and sold to delmenhorst directly . the town of delmenhorst is currently looking into the legal ramifications if mergel does decide to give rieger and his neo-nazi foundation the hotel as a gift , which is not yet a certainty .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .
i do n't see any innocents under the sun .
please , stop the polemics : we must try to build a new european way of life .
some forces do n't like and do n't want a strong , really independent european union .
every day , someone blows on the fire of our errors of the past decades and centuries .

new coach joachim löw said before the friendly match against sweden that his team would carry on with the attacking style , and they did so on wednesday , winning 3-0 in gelsenkirchen .
like in their round of 16 victory on june 24 , a two-goal barrage in the first ten minutes decided the match before the players were even really warmed up .
fuelled by the good vibes from the world cup , germany lay on top after only 3 and a half minutes , when bernd schneider scored from seven meters out after a skillful cross from tim borowski .
certainly reason to be happy for bernd schneider .
but afterwards it was time for the man with the golden boot - miroslav klose .
the top goalscorer at the world cup , klose struck in the 8th minute after adroitly avoiding two defenders and sliding the ball under unlucky swedish keeper rami shabaan .
it was deja vu in gelsenkirchen .
germany were up 2-0 early .
the swedes offered little resistance either defensively or up front , and just before the interval , klose sealed the contest with his most potent weapon , a header against which shabaan had no chance .
euphoria still in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 82 million fans still clearly behind the " new " team in most post-match interviews , the german players spoke of how they felt the euphoria that was omnipresent during the world cup , and it was unmistakable at the arena auf schalke .
in the first half , it carried the team that played with elan and poise .
in the second half , manuel friedrich and malik fathi debuted with the national squad .
head coach joachim löw ’ s team had it easy against sweden and the coach noticed just how much confidence his team is playing with .
other action on wednesday the qualifications to the european cup will shape the next few months .
germany faces their first opponent , ireland , on september 2 .
the irish took a drubbing at the hands of holland , losing 4-0 on wednesday .
also of interest , defending euro champions greece were thrashed by england , also by a score of 4-0 .
and world cup winners , italy , lost 2-0 to croatia , but without a single player from the championships in june and july . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2006 city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one town is trying everything to prevent neo-nazis from taking over a local hotel the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .
but can they stop a desperate hotel owner from jumping through legal loopholes to give it away ? a financially hard-up hotel owner in delmenhorst announced late tuesday he may give away his 100-room facility as a gift to neo-nazi jürgen rieger . rieger , a lawyer who has defended prominent ex-nazis and is active in the neo-nazi scene , was planning to purchase the hotel for 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- and turn it into a conference center for right-extremist gatherings and events . he has encountered fierce resistance from the residents of the small northern german town of 80,000 people , who have not only staged protests but also raised more than 730,000 euros in an effort to buy back the hotel themselves . the case , however , is a legal maze . city adds hotel to redevelopme n t area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger has been a speaker at rallies in remembrance of hitler 's deputy rudolf hess after desperately searching for a solution that was satisfactory to the city 's residents and fell with the bounds of the law , the town of delmenhorst officially enlarged the downtown renovation area .
the hotel , located just minutes from the main train station , now falls within space intended for redevelopment . redrawing the lines automatically gave the town a preemptive right to purchase the building at price defined by a neutral third party . hotel owner günter mergel threw a new loophole into the process when he announced that he plans to give the hotel to the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization .
rieger oversees the organization , which was founded by and named after a wealthy ex-nazi from bremen . giving away the hotel , in the legal sense , would effectively " annul the city 's right to buy first , " said the owner of the hotel , which has stood empty for 14 months . a gift with a price tag naturally , mergel 's proposed gift comes with strings attached .
according to news reports , the foundation would take over his hefty debts and pay the gift tax on the building .
here 's the catch : it would also purchase the hotel 's inventory for a convenient 3.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disputed hotel in delmenhorst mergel defended this option as a way to avoid drawn-out negotiations with the town , which he accused of consistently not responding to complaints of noise disturbance surrounding his centrally located building , reported the daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger . some suspect , however , that the hotel owner expects the deal will bring in a great deal more cash than if he gave in to protestors ' wishes and sold to delmenhorst directly . the town of delmenhorst is currently looking into the legal ramifications if mergel does decide to give rieger and his neo-nazi foundation the hotel as a gift , which is not yet a certainty .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .
it has been imposed in order to defeat terrorism and to protect our public and that is what the three ministers have as our highest priority , " reid said . britain has said it is currently holding 24 people in custody in connection with the alleged plot .
the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened . " the french interior minister recalled that " a heightened threat " of terrorist attack remained in france " even if at the moment we speak , there is no known link with what could have happened in britain . " in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement last month . in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany is believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wal-mart 's germany ceo david wild , who is from england , said in a recent newspaper interview .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " first ear n i n gs decli n e i n a decade the earnings decline was wal-mart 's first since early 1996 , which itself was the company 's first profit fall since it started trading as a public company in 1970 . the retailer also announced in the past quarter that it was selling its 16 stores in south korea , but it did not mention any material impact from this in its earnings statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart was disappointed with its us sales too " these changes allow us to continue to focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact on wal-mart 's growth and our roi -lrb- return on investment -rrb- strategy , " company chief executive lee scott said .
" we are , however , quite honestly disappointed in the sales performance of wal-mart us .
some of the same issues affecting our customers , such as higher utility costs and gas -lrb- gasoline -rrb- prices , are impacting corporations like wal-mart as well . " despite the hefty charge in germany , wal-mart stuck to its earnings targets for the 2006-2007 fiscal year . it predicted it would earn $ 2.88-2.95 per share over the 12 months , against wall street 's forecast of $ 2.92 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest retailer wal-mart closes up shop in germany retailing giant wal-mart is bidding auf wiedersehen to germany .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .
" miroslav klose and lukas podolski will start against sweden , " löw said at a press conference on sunday .
" it was a partnership that worked well at the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw sticks with germany 's world cup strike force klose scored five goals at the world cup while the 21-year-old podolski scored three times . sweden should need no firing up for the match with their 2-0 defeat in the world cup still fresh in their memory .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened .

" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .

it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .

11 .
over the years , it 's been cautiously beefed up to include laws making it easier to deport those preaching jihad as well as giving intelligence agencies access to telephone and bank data . the german parliament recently extended the legislation by another five years . " variety of useless tools " but , experts are n't so sure about the effectiveness of many of the measures . " we have a variety of tools in our toolbox to tackle terrorism , but they 're mostly completely useless , " jansen said , pointing to the current debate on a country-wide anti-terror register , meant to speed up and simplify the exchange of information between germany 's myriad security agencies . " it 's a good proposal , but it comes way too late , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of three defendants accused of being members of al qaeda in a german courtroom in may 2006 a counterterrorism center set up in 2004 , meant to improve cooperation between the security services , has also come in for flak . " it may sound like a central crisis center in the case of a terrorist attack , but it 's merely meant to exchange information , " jansen said .
" besides , at least 37 different federal agencies have to coordinate there before they can be even prepared if an emergency crops up . " concerns over civil liberties , nazi past german courts and prosecutors too have come under fire in the past for their perceived failure to put dangerous extremists behind bars following mild sentences and acquittals served in a string of terrorist trials . vocal protest by defenders of civil liberties and data protection and the country 's mindfulness of nazi-era abuses by security forces have also placed restrictions on measures such as allowing police to trawl electronic databases to find possible terror suspects and act preemptively against such individuals . " the police have to be given the possibility to investigate forcefully and in the long-term , " bernhard witthaut , the police union 's deputy chairman , told reuters .
" only then can we be successful in the fight against terror . " some say that what is needed is a complete overhaul of the security services . " we still deal with terrorism with security structures dating from the cold war and from fighting leftwing terrorism in the 1970s , " jansen said .
" we have to recognize that the situation has changed since then and that we 're dealing with a new threat . " getting to the root of the problem others point out that germany also needs to focus on measures to prevent radicalization among its 3.2-million-strong muslim community . " you ca n't only counter terrorism by installing 10,000 more video cameras , " said udo ulfkotte , a terrorism expert .
" we need to get to the root of the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say measures are needed to prevent radicalization among young muslims in may this year , the german government said it wanted to step up an education program in schools to prevent young people from drifting into extremist movements . " just as we take great care to teach young people in germany why we do n't want to have future nazis , we have to explain why we do n't want future radical islamists , " ulfkotte said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe on high alert after british terror scare the thwarting of a plot in britain to blow up aircraft in mid-flight has underlined the need for europe to stay both tough and vigilant when it comes to fighting terrorism , according to security experts in germany .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .

new coach joachim löw said before the friendly match against sweden that his team would carry on with the attacking style , and they did so on wednesday , winning 3-0 in gelsenkirchen .
like in their round of 16 victory on june 24 , a two-goal barrage in the first ten minutes decided the match before the players were even really warmed up .
fuelled by the good vibes from the world cup , germany lay on top after only 3 and a half minutes , when bernd schneider scored from seven meters out after a skillful cross from tim borowski .
certainly reason to be happy for bernd schneider .
but afterwards it was time for the man with the golden boot - miroslav klose .
the top goalscorer at the world cup , klose struck in the 8th minute after adroitly avoiding two defenders and sliding the ball under unlucky swedish keeper rami shabaan .
it was deja vu in gelsenkirchen .
germany were up 2-0 early .
the swedes offered little resistance either defensively or up front , and just before the interval , klose sealed the contest with his most potent weapon , a header against which shabaan had no chance .
euphoria still in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 82 million fans still clearly behind the " new " team in most post-match interviews , the german players spoke of how they felt the euphoria that was omnipresent during the world cup , and it was unmistakable at the arena auf schalke .
in the first half , it carried the team that played with elan and poise .
in the second half , manuel friedrich and malik fathi debuted with the national squad .
head coach joachim löw ’ s team had it easy against sweden and the coach noticed just how much confidence his team is playing with .
other action on wednesday the qualifications to the european cup will shape the next few months .
germany faces their first opponent , ireland , on september 2 .
the irish took a drubbing at the hands of holland , losing 4-0 on wednesday .
also of interest , defending euro champions greece were thrashed by england , also by a score of 4-0 .
and world cup winners , italy , lost 2-0 to croatia , but without a single player from the championships in june and july . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .
it has been imposed in order to defeat terrorism and to protect our public and that is what the three ministers have as our highest priority , " reid said . britain has said it is currently holding 24 people in custody in connection with the alleged plot .
the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened . " the french interior minister recalled that " a heightened threat " of terrorist attack remained in france " even if at the moment we speak , there is no known link with what could have happened in britain . " in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

new coach joachim löw said before the friendly match against sweden that his team would carry on with the attacking style , and they did so on wednesday , winning 3-0 in gelsenkirchen .
like in their round of 16 victory on june 24 , a two-goal barrage in the first ten minutes decided the match before the players were even really warmed up .
fuelled by the good vibes from the world cup , germany lay on top after only 3 and a half minutes , when bernd schneider scored from seven meters out after a skillful cross from tim borowski .
certainly reason to be happy for bernd schneider .
but afterwards it was time for the man with the golden boot - miroslav klose .
the top goalscorer at the world cup , klose struck in the 8th minute after adroitly avoiding two defenders and sliding the ball under unlucky swedish keeper rami shabaan .
it was deja vu in gelsenkirchen .
germany were up 2-0 early .
the swedes offered little resistance either defensively or up front , and just before the interval , klose sealed the contest with his most potent weapon , a header against which shabaan had no chance .
euphoria still in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 82 million fans still clearly behind the " new " team in most post-match interviews , the german players spoke of how they felt the euphoria that was omnipresent during the world cup , and it was unmistakable at the arena auf schalke .
in the first half , it carried the team that played with elan and poise .
in the second half , manuel friedrich and malik fathi debuted with the national squad .
head coach joachim löw ’ s team had it easy against sweden and the coach noticed just how much confidence his team is playing with .
other action on wednesday the qualifications to the european cup will shape the next few months .
germany faces their first opponent , ireland , on september 2 .
the irish took a drubbing at the hands of holland , losing 4-0 on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2006 experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany drew the most logical lesson from the british incident- raising airport security the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .
security experts say there are serious deficits . like most jittery european capitals , berlin rushed to beef up security last week after britain said it had thwarted bomb attacks on transatlantic airliners . the sense of panic has given way to a debate on security , fueled by reports that one of the arrested suspects in london had a link to hamburg , where three of the sept .
11 , 2001 suicide bombers had lived . though politicians are split on boosting existing counter-terrorism legislation , there is agreement across the board that germany is well-equipped to deal with terrorism . " huge deficits " the view is at sharp odds to assessments by security experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's beefed up security in the wake of the madrid bombings in 2004 " germany has huge deficits , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" almost five years after the sept .
11 attacks , not much is left of the anti-terrorism package , germany still has n't signed on to the eu-wide arrest warrant system and the surveillance of residences and communication systems has become increasingly difficult . " germany began putting together its counter-terrorism package in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 .
over the years , it 's been cautiously beefed up to include laws making it easier to deport those preaching jihad as well as giving intelligence agencies access to telephone and bank data . the german parliament recently extended the legislation by another five years . " variety of useless tools " but , experts are n't so sure about the effectiveness of many of the measures . " we have a variety of tools in our toolbox to tackle terrorism , but they 're mostly completely useless , " jansen said , pointing to the current debate on a country-wide anti-terror register , meant to speed up and simplify the exchange of information between germany 's myriad security agencies . " it 's a good proposal , but it comes way too late , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of three defendants accused of being members of al qaeda in a german courtroom in may 2006 a counterterrorism center set up in 2004 , meant to improve cooperation between the security services , has also come in for flak . " it may sound like a central crisis center in the case of a terrorist attack , but it 's merely meant to exchange information , " jansen said .
" besides , at least 37 different federal agencies have to coordinate there before they can be even prepared if an emergency crops up . " concerns over civil liberties , nazi past german courts and prosecutors too have come under fire in the past for their perceived failure to put dangerous extremists behind bars following mild sentences and acquittals served in a string of terrorist trials . vocal protest by defenders of civil liberties and data protection and the country 's mindfulness of nazi-era abuses by security forces have also placed restrictions on measures such as allowing police to trawl electronic databases to find possible terror suspects and act preemptively against such individuals . " the police have to be given the possibility to investigate forcefully and in the long-term , " bernhard witthaut , the police union 's deputy chairman , told reuters .
" only then can we be successful in the fight against terror . " some say that what is needed is a complete overhaul of the security services . " we still deal with terrorism with security structures dating from the cold war and from fighting leftwing terrorism in the 1970s , " jansen said .

new coach joachim löw said before the friendly match against sweden that his team would carry on with the attacking style , and they did so on wednesday , winning 3-0 in gelsenkirchen .
like in their round of 16 victory on june 24 , a two-goal barrage in the first ten minutes decided the match before the players were even really warmed up .
fuelled by the good vibes from the world cup , germany lay on top after only 3 and a half minutes , when bernd schneider scored from seven meters out after a skillful cross from tim borowski .
certainly reason to be happy for bernd schneider .
but afterwards it was time for the man with the golden boot - miroslav klose .
the top goalscorer at the world cup , klose struck in the 8th minute after adroitly avoiding two defenders and sliding the ball under unlucky swedish keeper rami shabaan .
it was deja vu in gelsenkirchen .
germany were up 2-0 early .
the swedes offered little resistance either defensively or up front , and just before the interval , klose sealed the contest with his most potent weapon , a header against which shabaan had no chance .
euphoria still in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 82 million fans still clearly behind the " new " team in most post-match interviews , the german players spoke of how they felt the euphoria that was omnipresent during the world cup , and it was unmistakable at the arena auf schalke .
in the first half , it carried the team that played with elan and poise .
in the second half , manuel friedrich and malik fathi debuted with the national squad .
head coach joachim löw ’ s team had it easy against sweden and the coach noticed just how much confidence his team is playing with .
other action on wednesday the qualifications to the european cup will shape the next few months .
germany faces their first opponent , ireland , on september 2 .
the irish took a drubbing at the hands of holland , losing 4-0 on wednesday .
also of interest , defending euro champions greece were thrashed by england , also by a score of 4-0 .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .
controversy over a mock crucifixion during the concert has dogged the tour so far , and the german regulators will be watching in an attempt to determine whether the scene could be construed as insulting religious beliefs . nailed on a " disco cross " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madonna pole-dancing in a skin-tight catsuit : a less provocative scene from her current show during the offensive section , madonna is hoisted onto what can be loosely termed a " disco cross " while wearing a crown of thorns .
the mock crucifixion has caused outrage in many of the countries in which the singer has performed during the tour to date . the vatican is especially upset .
cardinal ersilio tonino , speaking with the approval of the pope , recently called the concert " a blasphemous challenge to the faith " and a " profanation of the cross " after madonna had played rome .
he also called for madonna , who was raised as a catholic , to be excommunicated . madonna in blasphemy row - again " it is disrespectful , in bad taste and provocative , " added father manfredo leone from rome 's santa maria liberatrice church .
" being raised on a cross with a crown of thorns like a modern christ is absurd .
doing it in the cradle of christianity comes close to blasphemy . " the scene has also offended jewish and muslim leaders . " it is an idea in the worst possible taste and she would be better to return home , " suggested mario scajola , head of the italian muslim league , after the rome show . russia 's orthodox church accused madonna of exploiting christian symbols for her own ends and called for a boycott of her first-ever concert in moscow , when she played there earlier this month .

" the context of madonna 's performance on the crucifix is neither negative nor disrespectful toward the church , " she said . the german authorities will make up their own minds on the crucifixion matter this weekend and also on whether the giant screen , which flashes images ranging from the pope , osama bin laden , us president george w. bush , chinese leader mao zedong to italian fascist dictator benito mussolini , is in bad taste . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politician 's blasphemy plan gets cool reception bavaria 's conservative premier stoiber recently proposed tightening germany 's blasphemy laws .

but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .

security experts say there are serious deficits . like most jittery european capitals , berlin rushed to beef up security last week after britain said it had thwarted bomb attacks on transatlantic airliners . the sense of panic has given way to a debate on security , fueled by reports that one of the arrested suspects in london had a link to hamburg , where three of the sept .
11 , 2001 suicide bombers had lived . though politicians are split on boosting existing counter-terrorism legislation , there is agreement across the board that germany is well-equipped to deal with terrorism . " huge deficits " the view is at sharp odds to assessments by security experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's beefed up security in the wake of the madrid bombings in 2004 " germany has huge deficits , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" almost five years after the sept .
11 attacks , not much is left of the anti-terrorism package , germany still has n't signed on to the eu-wide arrest warrant system and the surveillance of residences and communication systems has become increasingly difficult . " germany began putting together its counter-terrorism package in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 .
over the years , it 's been cautiously beefed up to include laws making it easier to deport those preaching jihad as well as giving intelligence agencies access to telephone and bank data . the german parliament recently extended the legislation by another five years . " variety of useless tools " but , experts are n't so sure about the effectiveness of many of the measures . " we have a variety of tools in our toolbox to tackle terrorism , but they 're mostly completely useless , " jansen said , pointing to the current debate on a country-wide anti-terror register , meant to speed up and simplify the exchange of information between germany 's myriad security agencies . " it 's a good proposal , but it comes way too late , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of three defendants accused of being members of al qaeda in a german courtroom in may 2006 a counterterrorism center set up in 2004 , meant to improve cooperation between the security services , has also come in for flak . " it may sound like a central crisis center in the case of a terrorist attack , but it 's merely meant to exchange information , " jansen said .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .
i do n't see any innocents under the sun .
please , stop the polemics : we must try to build a new european way of life .
some forces do n't like and do n't want a strong , really independent european union .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .
it has been imposed in order to defeat terrorism and to protect our public and that is what the three ministers have as our highest priority , " reid said . britain has said it is currently holding 24 people in custody in connection with the alleged plot .
the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened . " the french interior minister recalled that " a heightened threat " of terrorist attack remained in france " even if at the moment we speak , there is no known link with what could have happened in britain . " in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement last month . in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany is believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wal-mart 's germany ceo david wild , who is from england , said in a recent newspaper interview .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " first ear n i n gs decli n e i n a decade the earnings decline was wal-mart 's first since early 1996 , which itself was the company 's first profit fall since it started trading as a public company in 1970 . the retailer also announced in the past quarter that it was selling its 16 stores in south korea , but it did not mention any material impact from this in its earnings statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart was disappointed with its us sales too " these changes allow us to continue to focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact on wal-mart 's growth and our roi -lrb- return on investment -rrb- strategy , " company chief executive lee scott said .
" we are , however , quite honestly disappointed in the sales performance of wal-mart us .
some of the same issues affecting our customers , such as higher utility costs and gas -lrb- gasoline -rrb- prices , are impacting corporations like wal-mart as well . " despite the hefty charge in germany , wal-mart stuck to its earnings targets for the 2006-2007 fiscal year . it predicted it would earn $ 2.88-2.95 per share over the 12 months , against wall street 's forecast of $ 2.92 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest retailer wal-mart closes up shop in germany retailing giant wal-mart is bidding auf wiedersehen to germany .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .

" " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign .

per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .

but can they stop a desperate hotel owner from jumping through legal loopholes to give it away ? a financially hard-up hotel owner in delmenhorst announced late tuesday he may give away his 100-room facility as a gift to neo-nazi jürgen rieger . rieger , a lawyer who has defended prominent ex-nazis and is active in the neo-nazi scene , was planning to purchase the hotel for 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- and turn it into a conference center for right-extremist gatherings and events . he has encountered fierce resistance from the residents of the small northern german town of 80,000 people , who have not only staged protests but also raised more than 730,000 euros in an effort to buy back the hotel themselves . the case , however , is a legal maze . city adds hotel to redevelopme n t area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger has been a speaker at rallies in remembrance of hitler 's deputy rudolf hess after desperately searching for a solution that was satisfactory to the city 's residents and fell with the bounds of the law , the town of delmenhorst officially enlarged the downtown renovation area .
the hotel , located just minutes from the main train station , now falls within space intended for redevelopment . redrawing the lines automatically gave the town a preemptive right to purchase the building at price defined by a neutral third party . hotel owner günter mergel threw a new loophole into the process when he announced that he plans to give the hotel to the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization .
rieger oversees the organization , which was founded by and named after a wealthy ex-nazi from bremen . giving away the hotel , in the legal sense , would effectively " annul the city 's right to buy first , " said the owner of the hotel , which has stood empty for 14 months . a gift with a price tag naturally , mergel 's proposed gift comes with strings attached .
according to news reports , the foundation would take over his hefty debts and pay the gift tax on the building .
here 's the catch : it would also purchase the hotel 's inventory for a convenient 3.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disputed hotel in delmenhorst mergel defended this option as a way to avoid drawn-out negotiations with the town , which he accused of consistently not responding to complaints of noise disturbance surrounding his centrally located building , reported the daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger . some suspect , however , that the hotel owner expects the deal will bring in a great deal more cash than if he gave in to protestors ' wishes and sold to delmenhorst directly . the town of delmenhorst is currently looking into the legal ramifications if mergel does decide to give rieger and his neo-nazi foundation the hotel as a gift , which is not yet a certainty .

thanks to the combination of mass-released endorphins and global warming , germany is no longer believed to be a boring country of obsessive-compulsive busy-bees , but rather a northern mediterranean paradise of party animals and politicians who spend most of their time jumping up and down in soccer stadiums . unfortunately , we 're only now beginning to learn about the other side of the medal .
the world cup lasted four weeks , but the hot weather persisted even longer - with disastrous consequences for germany 's sex life . apparently , germans simply do n't get hot for love when it 's sizzling hot outside .
they just do n't have the brazilian stamina for that kind of thing .
which is exactly why germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , beate uhse , announced disappointing results for the first half of 2005 . unfulfilled desires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hot weather has been bad for business " because the summer has been so hot , we got to feel the consumers ' disinclination to buy , " said management spokeman otto christian lindemann on monday . the company revenues fell by 138.5 million euros -lrb- $ 176.5 million -rrb- - almost five percent - when compared to the same period in 2005 .
" our expectations remain , therefore , unfulfilled . " after weeks of frustrated financial and erotic expectations , however , germany experienced a significant temperature drop in august .
it is only to be hoped that the saharan temperatures did not leave a permanent mark on the german psyche . therefore , dear german friends , it 's time to stand up for your weather preferences and say an even louder " no " to global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.08.2006 experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany drew the most logical lesson from the british incident- raising airport security the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .
security experts say there are serious deficits . like most jittery european capitals , berlin rushed to beef up security last week after britain said it had thwarted bomb attacks on transatlantic airliners . the sense of panic has given way to a debate on security , fueled by reports that one of the arrested suspects in london had a link to hamburg , where three of the sept .
11 , 2001 suicide bombers had lived . though politicians are split on boosting existing counter-terrorism legislation , there is agreement across the board that germany is well-equipped to deal with terrorism . " huge deficits " the view is at sharp odds to assessments by security experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's beefed up security in the wake of the madrid bombings in 2004 " germany has huge deficits , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" almost five years after the sept .
11 attacks , not much is left of the anti-terrorism package , germany still has n't signed on to the eu-wide arrest warrant system and the surveillance of residences and communication systems has become increasingly difficult . " germany began putting together its counter-terrorism package in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 .
over the years , it 's been cautiously beefed up to include laws making it easier to deport those preaching jihad as well as giving intelligence agencies access to telephone and bank data . the german parliament recently extended the legislation by another five years . " variety of useless tools " but , experts are n't so sure about the effectiveness of many of the measures . " we have a variety of tools in our toolbox to tackle terrorism , but they 're mostly completely useless , " jansen said , pointing to the current debate on a country-wide anti-terror register , meant to speed up and simplify the exchange of information between germany 's myriad security agencies . " it 's a good proposal , but it comes way too late , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of three defendants accused of being members of al qaeda in a german courtroom in may 2006 a counterterrorism center set up in 2004 , meant to improve cooperation between the security services , has also come in for flak . " it may sound like a central crisis center in the case of a terrorist attack , but it 's merely meant to exchange information , " jansen said .
" besides , at least 37 different federal agencies have to coordinate there before they can be even prepared if an emergency crops up .

security experts say there are serious deficits . like most jittery european capitals , berlin rushed to beef up security last week after britain said it had thwarted bomb attacks on transatlantic airliners . the sense of panic has given way to a debate on security , fueled by reports that one of the arrested suspects in london had a link to hamburg , where three of the sept .
11 , 2001 suicide bombers had lived . though politicians are split on boosting existing counter-terrorism legislation , there is agreement across the board that germany is well-equipped to deal with terrorism . " huge deficits " the view is at sharp odds to assessments by security experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's beefed up security in the wake of the madrid bombings in 2004 " germany has huge deficits , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" almost five years after the sept .
11 attacks , not much is left of the anti-terrorism package , germany still has n't signed on to the eu-wide arrest warrant system and the surveillance of residences and communication systems has become increasingly difficult . " germany began putting together its counter-terrorism package in the wake of the attacks of sept .
11 .
over the years , it 's been cautiously beefed up to include laws making it easier to deport those preaching jihad as well as giving intelligence agencies access to telephone and bank data . the german parliament recently extended the legislation by another five years . " variety of useless tools " but , experts are n't so sure about the effectiveness of many of the measures . " we have a variety of tools in our toolbox to tackle terrorism , but they 're mostly completely useless , " jansen said , pointing to the current debate on a country-wide anti-terror register , meant to speed up and simplify the exchange of information between germany 's myriad security agencies . " it 's a good proposal , but it comes way too late , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of three defendants accused of being members of al qaeda in a german courtroom in may 2006 a counterterrorism center set up in 2004 , meant to improve cooperation between the security services , has also come in for flak . " it may sound like a central crisis center in the case of a terrorist attack , but it 's merely meant to exchange information , " jansen said .
" besides , at least 37 different federal agencies have to coordinate there before they can be even prepared if an emergency crops up . " concerns over civil liberties , nazi past german courts and prosecutors too have come under fire in the past for their perceived failure to put dangerous extremists behind bars following mild sentences and acquittals served in a string of terrorist trials . vocal protest by defenders of civil liberties and data protection and the country 's mindfulness of nazi-era abuses by security forces have also placed restrictions on measures such as allowing police to trawl electronic databases to find possible terror suspects and act preemptively against such individuals . " the police have to be given the possibility to investigate forcefully and in the long-term , " bernhard witthaut , the police union 's deputy chairman , told reuters .
" only then can we be successful in the fight against terror . " some say that what is needed is a complete overhaul of the security services . " we still deal with terrorism with security structures dating from the cold war and from fighting leftwing terrorism in the 1970s , " jansen said .
" we have to recognize that the situation has changed since then and that we 're dealing with a new threat . " getting to the root of the problem others point out that germany also needs to focus on measures to prevent radicalization among its 3.2-million-strong muslim community . " you ca n't only counter terrorism by installing 10,000 more video cameras , " said udo ulfkotte , a terrorism expert .
" we need to get to the root of the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say measures are needed to prevent radicalization among young muslims in may this year , the german government said it wanted to step up an education program in schools to prevent young people from drifting into extremist movements . " just as we take great care to teach young people in germany why we do n't want to have future nazis , we have to explain why we do n't want future radical islamists , " ulfkotte said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe on high alert after british terror scare the thwarting of a plot in britain to blow up aircraft in mid-flight has underlined the need for europe to stay both tough and vigilant when it comes to fighting terrorism , according to security experts in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.08.2006 new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jögi löw keeps faith with his young stars and the master plan for germany 's future joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden . it was probably the most perfect ten minutes of the 2006 world cup .
with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .
" miroslav klose and lukas podolski will start against sweden , " löw said at a press conference on sunday .
" it was a partnership that worked well at the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw sticks with germany 's world cup strike force klose scored five goals at the world cup while the 21-year-old podolski scored three times . sweden should need no firing up for the match with their 2-0 defeat in the world cup still fresh in their memory .

" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement last month . in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany is believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wal-mart 's germany ceo david wild , who is from england , said in a recent newspaper interview .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " first ear n i n gs decli n e i n a decade the earnings decline was wal-mart 's first since early 1996 , which itself was the company 's first profit fall since it started trading as a public company in 1970 . the retailer also announced in the past quarter that it was selling its 16 stores in south korea , but it did not mention any material impact from this in its earnings statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart was disappointed with its us sales too " these changes allow us to continue to focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact on wal-mart 's growth and our roi -lrb- return on investment -rrb- strategy , " company chief executive lee scott said .
" we are , however , quite honestly disappointed in the sales performance of wal-mart us .
some of the same issues affecting our customers , such as higher utility costs and gas -lrb- gasoline -rrb- prices , are impacting corporations like wal-mart as well . " despite the hefty charge in germany , wal-mart stuck to its earnings targets for the 2006-2007 fiscal year . it predicted it would earn $ 2.88-2.95 per share over the 12 months , against wall street 's forecast of $ 2.92 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest retailer wal-mart closes up shop in germany retailing giant wal-mart is bidding auf wiedersehen to germany .

new coach joachim löw said before the friendly match against sweden that his team would carry on with the attacking style , and they did so on wednesday , winning 3-0 in gelsenkirchen .
like in their round of 16 victory on june 24 , a two-goal barrage in the first ten minutes decided the match before the players were even really warmed up .

certainly reason to be happy for bernd schneider .
but afterwards it was time for the man with the golden boot - miroslav klose .
the top goalscorer at the world cup , klose struck in the 8th minute after adroitly avoiding two defenders and sliding the ball under unlucky swedish keeper rami shabaan .
it was deja vu in gelsenkirchen .
germany were up 2-0 early .
the swedes offered little resistance either defensively or up front , and just before the interval , klose sealed the contest with his most potent weapon , a header against which shabaan had no chance .
euphoria still in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 82 million fans still clearly behind the " new " team in most post-match interviews , the german players spoke of how they felt the euphoria that was omnipresent during the world cup , and it was unmistakable at the arena auf schalke .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .
controversy over a mock crucifixion during the concert has dogged the tour so far , and the german regulators will be watching in an attempt to determine whether the scene could be construed as insulting religious beliefs . nailed on a " disco cross " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madonna pole-dancing in a skin-tight catsuit : a less provocative scene from her current show during the offensive section , madonna is hoisted onto what can be loosely termed a " disco cross " while wearing a crown of thorns .
the mock crucifixion has caused outrage in many of the countries in which the singer has performed during the tour to date . the vatican is especially upset .
cardinal ersilio tonino , speaking with the approval of the pope , recently called the concert " a blasphemous challenge to the faith " and a " profanation of the cross " after madonna had played rome .
he also called for madonna , who was raised as a catholic , to be excommunicated . madonna in blasphemy row - again " it is disrespectful , in bad taste and provocative , " added father manfredo leone from rome 's santa maria liberatrice church .
" being raised on a cross with a crown of thorns like a modern christ is absurd .
doing it in the cradle of christianity comes close to blasphemy . " the scene has also offended jewish and muslim leaders . " it is an idea in the worst possible taste and she would be better to return home , " suggested mario scajola , head of the italian muslim league , after the rome show . russia 's orthodox church accused madonna of exploiting christian symbols for her own ends and called for a boycott of her first-ever concert in moscow , when she played there earlier this month . " the us singer madonna exploits christian symbols - the cross , rosary beads and the crucifix - and tries to equate human passions , including her own personal passions , with something sacred , " the spokesman for the patriarch of moscow said in a statement . not disrespectful to church ... but world leaders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few moms can pull this off the singer 's spokeswoman , liz rosenberg , issued a statement in defense of the singer , denying that the star 's show was insulting .
" the context of madonna 's performance on the crucifix is neither negative nor disrespectful toward the church , " she said . the german authorities will make up their own minds on the crucifixion matter this weekend and also on whether the giant screen , which flashes images ranging from the pope , osama bin laden , us president george w. bush , chinese leader mao zedong to italian fascist dictator benito mussolini , is in bad taste . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politician 's blasphemy plan gets cool reception bavaria 's conservative premier stoiber recently proposed tightening germany 's blasphemy laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.08.2006 new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jögi löw keeps faith with his young stars and the master plan for germany 's future joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden . it was probably the most perfect ten minutes of the 2006 world cup .
with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign .

new coach joachim löw said before the friendly match against sweden that his team would carry on with the attacking style , and they did so on wednesday , winning 3-0 in gelsenkirchen .
like in their round of 16 victory on june 24 , a two-goal barrage in the first ten minutes decided the match before the players were even really warmed up .
fuelled by the good vibes from the world cup , germany lay on top after only 3 and a half minutes , when bernd schneider scored from seven meters out after a skillful cross from tim borowski .
certainly reason to be happy for bernd schneider .
but afterwards it was time for the man with the golden boot - miroslav klose .
the top goalscorer at the world cup , klose struck in the 8th minute after adroitly avoiding two defenders and sliding the ball under unlucky swedish keeper rami shabaan .
it was deja vu in gelsenkirchen .
germany were up 2-0 early .
the swedes offered little resistance either defensively or up front , and just before the interval , klose sealed the contest with his most potent weapon , a header against which shabaan had no chance .
euphoria still in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 82 million fans still clearly behind the " new " team in most post-match interviews , the german players spoke of how they felt the euphoria that was omnipresent during the world cup , and it was unmistakable at the arena auf schalke .
in the first half , it carried the team that played with elan and poise .
in the second half , manuel friedrich and malik fathi debuted with the national squad .
head coach joachim löw ’ s team had it easy against sweden and the coach noticed just how much confidence his team is playing with .
other action on wednesday the qualifications to the european cup will shape the next few months .
germany faces their first opponent , ireland , on september 2 .
the irish took a drubbing at the hands of holland , losing 4-0 on wednesday .
also of interest , defending euro champions greece were thrashed by england , also by a score of 4-0 .
and world cup winners , italy , lost 2-0 to croatia , but without a single player from the championships in june and july . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

thanks to the combination of mass-released endorphins and global warming , germany is no longer believed to be a boring country of obsessive-compulsive busy-bees , but rather a northern mediterranean paradise of party animals and politicians who spend most of their time jumping up and down in soccer stadiums . unfortunately , we 're only now beginning to learn about the other side of the medal .
the world cup lasted four weeks , but the hot weather persisted even longer - with disastrous consequences for germany 's sex life . apparently , germans simply do n't get hot for love when it 's sizzling hot outside .
they just do n't have the brazilian stamina for that kind of thing .
which is exactly why germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , beate uhse , announced disappointing results for the first half of 2005 . unfulfilled desires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hot weather has been bad for business " because the summer has been so hot , we got to feel the consumers ' disinclination to buy , " said management spokeman otto christian lindemann on monday . the company revenues fell by 138.5 million euros -lrb- $ 176.5 million -rrb- - almost five percent - when compared to the same period in 2005 .
" our expectations remain , therefore , unfulfilled . " after weeks of frustrated financial and erotic expectations , however , germany experienced a significant temperature drop in august .
it is only to be hoped that the saharan temperatures did not leave a permanent mark on the german psyche . therefore , dear german friends , it 's time to stand up for your weather preferences and say an even louder " no " to global warming .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .
" miroslav klose and lukas podolski will start against sweden , " löw said at a press conference on sunday .
" it was a partnership that worked well at the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw sticks with germany 's world cup strike force klose scored five goals at the world cup while the 21-year-old podolski scored three times . sweden should need no firing up for the match with their 2-0 defeat in the world cup still fresh in their memory .
like germany they are also warming up for the euro 2008 qualifiers with their first match against latvia on september 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann holds the door open for löw for two years , joachim löw has silently stood in the shadows of a more effervescent jürgen klinsmann .
now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 16.08.2006 how to measure an expellee 's suffering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : destroyed homes were a reality across europe after world war ii dw-world.de readers responded to a controversial berlin exhibition dealing with the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .
i do n't see any innocents under the sun .
please , stop the polemics : we must try to build a new european way of life .
some forces do n't like and do n't want a strong , really independent european union .
every day , someone blows on the fire of our errors of the past decades and centuries .
do you remember the latin motto " divide et impera ? "
please , european citizens , do n't fall again in the traps of the past ! - marco complied by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish press review : ' exhibit hurtful to polish-german relations ' the polish press generally responded with indignation , tempered with some degree of understanding , to the controversial berlin exhibit on people expelled from their homes after world war ii .

" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement last month . in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany is believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wal-mart 's germany ceo david wild , who is from england , said in a recent newspaper interview .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " first ear n i n gs decli n e i n a decade the earnings decline was wal-mart 's first since early 1996 , which itself was the company 's first profit fall since it started trading as a public company in 1970 . the retailer also announced in the past quarter that it was selling its 16 stores in south korea , but it did not mention any material impact from this in its earnings statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart was disappointed with its us sales too " these changes allow us to continue to focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact on wal-mart 's growth and our roi -lrb- return on investment -rrb- strategy , " company chief executive lee scott said .
" we are , however , quite honestly disappointed in the sales performance of wal-mart us .
some of the same issues affecting our customers , such as higher utility costs and gas -lrb- gasoline -rrb- prices , are impacting corporations like wal-mart as well . " despite the hefty charge in germany , wal-mart stuck to its earnings targets for the 2006-2007 fiscal year . it predicted it would earn $ 2.88-2.95 per share over the 12 months , against wall street 's forecast of $ 2.92 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest retailer wal-mart closes up shop in germany retailing giant wal-mart is bidding auf wiedersehen to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.08.2006 new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jögi löw keeps faith with his young stars and the master plan for germany 's future joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden . it was probably the most perfect ten minutes of the 2006 world cup .
with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .

thanks to the combination of mass-released endorphins and global warming , germany is no longer believed to be a boring country of obsessive-compulsive busy-bees , but rather a northern mediterranean paradise of party animals and politicians who spend most of their time jumping up and down in soccer stadiums . unfortunately , we 're only now beginning to learn about the other side of the medal .
the world cup lasted four weeks , but the hot weather persisted even longer - with disastrous consequences for germany 's sex life . apparently , germans simply do n't get hot for love when it 's sizzling hot outside .
they just do n't have the brazilian stamina for that kind of thing .
which is exactly why germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , beate uhse , announced disappointing results for the first half of 2005 . unfulfilled desires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hot weather has been bad for business " because the summer has been so hot , we got to feel the consumers ' disinclination to buy , " said management spokeman otto christian lindemann on monday . the company revenues fell by 138.5 million euros -lrb- $ 176.5 million -rrb- - almost five percent - when compared to the same period in 2005 .
" our expectations remain , therefore , unfulfilled . " after weeks of frustrated financial and erotic expectations , however , germany experienced a significant temperature drop in august .
it is only to be hoped that the saharan temperatures did not leave a permanent mark on the german psyche . therefore , dear german friends , it 's time to stand up for your weather preferences and say an even louder " no " to global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 16.08.2006 how to measure an expellee 's suffering großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : destroyed homes were a reality across europe after world war ii dw-world.de readers responded to a controversial berlin exhibition dealing with the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?

the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.08.2006 new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jögi löw keeps faith with his young stars and the master plan for germany 's future joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden . it was probably the most perfect ten minutes of the 2006 world cup .
with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .
" miroslav klose and lukas podolski will start against sweden , " löw said at a press conference on sunday .
" it was a partnership that worked well at the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw sticks with germany 's world cup strike force klose scored five goals at the world cup while the 21-year-old podolski scored three times . sweden should need no firing up for the match with their 2-0 defeat in the world cup still fresh in their memory .

they listed germany 's priorities as helping to implement the resolution , to broker lasting peace in the middle east and to rebuild lebanon in the wake of the month-long israeli offensive against hezbollah militia .
germany wants to help " the coalition agrees that germany wants to make a contribution to solving the political problems in the middle east , " they said in a joint statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , müntefering and co , seem to be in agreement the meeting consisted of merkel , who leads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , social democratic party leader kurt beck and deputy chancellor franz müntefering , also a social democrat . government spokesman thomas steg said earlier that germany wanted to know more about the mandate of the un force before committing itself to contributing soldiers . " many questions are still open .
germany is prepared to make a contribution if there is a clear definition .
it depends on certain factors and these factors are still unclear , " he said .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .
i do n't see any innocents under the sun .
please , stop the polemics : we must try to build a new european way of life .
some forces do n't like and do n't want a strong , really independent european union .
every day , someone blows on the fire of our errors of the past decades and centuries .
do you remember the latin motto " divide et impera ? "
please , european citizens , do n't fall again in the traps of the past ! - marco complied by dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish press review : ' exhibit hurtful to polish-german relations ' the polish press generally responded with indignation , tempered with some degree of understanding , to the controversial berlin exhibit on people expelled from their homes after world war ii .

" as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement last month . in addition to proving ineffectual in fighting off cut-throat competition from local discount retailers aldi and lidl , wal-mart 's disastrous performance in germany is believed to have been a combination of pressuring german executives to enforce american-style management practices and a failure to fully understand the german market . if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wal-mart 's germany ceo david wild , who is from england , said in a recent newspaper interview .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " first ear n i n gs decli n e i n a decade the earnings decline was wal-mart 's first since early 1996 , which itself was the company 's first profit fall since it started trading as a public company in 1970 . the retailer also announced in the past quarter that it was selling its 16 stores in south korea , but it did not mention any material impact from this in its earnings statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart was disappointed with its us sales too " these changes allow us to continue to focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact on wal-mart 's growth and our roi -lrb- return on investment -rrb- strategy , " company chief executive lee scott said .
" we are , however , quite honestly disappointed in the sales performance of wal-mart us .
some of the same issues affecting our customers , such as higher utility costs and gas -lrb- gasoline -rrb- prices , are impacting corporations like wal-mart as well . " despite the hefty charge in germany , wal-mart stuck to its earnings targets for the 2006-2007 fiscal year . it predicted it would earn $ 2.88-2.95 per share over the 12 months , against wall street 's forecast of $ 2.92 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest retailer wal-mart closes up shop in germany retailing giant wal-mart is bidding auf wiedersehen to germany .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .
per mertesacker and robert huth are two other regulars unavailable for the friendly in gelsenkirchen . löw has called up hertha berlin 's german under-21 defender malik fathi and msv mainz defender manuel friedrich to plug the gap in the back four . but the main concern is ballack 's fitness after it was revealed that the injury he sustained in cardiff at the weekend was a recurring problem .
löw now just hopes his skipper is back fit in time for the ireland match , declaring : " we hope ballack is back as soon as possible and perhaps he can play again at the weekend . " world cup strikers get the nod but he can call upon the strike partnership of lukas podolski and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose for the sweden match .
" miroslav klose and lukas podolski will start against sweden , " löw said at a press conference on sunday .
" it was a partnership that worked well at the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw sticks with germany 's world cup strike force klose scored five goals at the world cup while the 21-year-old podolski scored three times . sweden should need no firing up for the match with their 2-0 defeat in the world cup still fresh in their memory .
like germany they are also warming up for the euro 2008 qualifiers with their first match against latvia on september 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann holds the door open for löw for two years , joachim löw has silently stood in the shadows of a more effervescent jürgen klinsmann .
now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's .

" the police have to be given the possibility to investigate forcefully and in the long-term , " bernhard witthaut , the police union 's deputy chairman , told reuters .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .
how can it be hurtful to polish-german relations ?
these are historical facts which can not be erased .
part of my family was expelled and in doing so , were very badly treated by the polish administration , so much though that my aunt died of a heart-attack .
this exhibit is important german history ! - dieter reimers i hope that they mention why germans had to be expelled from those lands .
do they mention millions of poles moved from ukraine , belarus , and lithuania because the border had been moved to west ?
germany started the war and they , and millions of others , paid the price .
it is shame to raise the issue of " victims " when you are the reason for all that unhappy time and those tragedies .
my mother lost whole family in the war .
she lived in the dachau and then a slave worker in germany for three years .
is ms. steinbach aware about those dramas or does she not care ?
germans should respect those who became victims of their action , not play the victims of others . - wally kowalski if an exhibition of photographs and similar historical facts is " rewriting history , " then that is a clear indicator that history , as it is written now , is currently not representing the truth and does need to be re-written . - martin wahl , canada . i think it 's great that this subject is finally getting some light .
for too long those that participated in the expulsion of the eastern european germans have worked hard to keep the facts swept under the rug or outright deny that they ever happened .
i also think it is time that the german government stop avoiding the issue and start representing all of its citizens .
one should not fear being branded an extremist simply for standing up for basic human rights .
the true lessons of history and war will never be learned until we fully examine and accept all that has happened . - joseph klein the story is full of horrors .
all people are guilty .
i do n't see any innocents under the sun .
please , stop the polemics : we must try to build a new european way of life .
some forces do n't like and do n't want a strong , really independent european union .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that is necessary to create a permanent exhibition and memorial of german expellees .
the suffering of millions of jews , poles , czechs and other europeans during the world war ii should not be underestimated , but , on the other hand , the european public should be informed also about the suffering of the german civilians .
unfortunately , many people do n't know the fact that tens of thousands of german civilians were killed by the english and american bombardments of dresden , leipzig , hamburg and other cities .
i think that the suffering of civilians is similar in many cases , and the fact that nazi germany is responsible for many atrocities during world war ii should not be accepted as an excuse for crimes committed against the german civilian population . - levent inanc a critical issue indeed .
how many centuries back in history does one go to prove whether the lands were german or polish ?
also , how many germans , in 1945 , knew what the nazis had done outside germany , and why poles might react in the way they did in 1945 ?
how relevant was the nazi reaction to the warsaw uprising in 1944 , and the numerous nazi slave labor and extermination camps in the same territories ?
how often were poles treated as " inferiors " during nazi occupation ?
the question in some cases is about individuals suffering for the inhumanity and injustice of politicians and other social powerbrokers .
it seems to me that the corporate supporters of the nazi party should compensate the displaced germans who were expelled from poland , as they both aided the nazis to abuse and / or kill thousands of poles , and provided the justification for the expulsions of germans from east prussia and silesia in 1945 .
if not for the corporate supporters of the nazi party , the problem might never have existed .
to be fair , those in positions of social power , responsible for the entire fiasco , starting in 1939 , should make any reparations requested by the expellees , particularly those pro-nazi corporations still flourishing today in germany . - blake finley congratulations to erika steinbach and wilfried rogasch for showing this exhibit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.08.2006 new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jögi löw keeps faith with his young stars and the master plan for germany 's future joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden . it was probably the most perfect ten minutes of the 2006 world cup .
with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .
it is unlikely that klinsmann would have anointed his successor so gladly if he thought that löw would rip up the plan they had formulated together and start anew . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann believes his vision is in safe hands löw is not exactly wet-behind-the-ears either .
a former coach at vfb stuttgart and austria vienna before taking on his role as klinsmann 's number two , he is a coach in the same mould as his predecessor and as such , there should be little or no deviation from the master plan the two of them concocted . euro 2008 qualifiers loom large however , the sweden friendly gives löw his first taste of what it 's like to have sole control of the team .
the pressure is on for the result to be a good one what with germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers beginning on september 2 .
germany will expect and löw will have to deliver . germany failed to win a single match at euro 2000 and euro 2004 but that has not stopped löw thinking positive for the 2008 edition in austria and switzerland . " we failed in our goal to win the world cup so we want to bring the euro 2008 title back to germany , " said löw , whose young team will face the republic of ireland in stuttgart in the first game of a long haul towards those finals .
" we ca n't bask in the world cup euphoria forever but we can take confidence from the fact that we can compete with the top teams .
this young team is not at the end of its development . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's heroes have a new target in sight even so , the coach is not expecting much from his side , many of whom have only recently returned to training after their world cup exploits .
" you have to be realistic at this stage of the season .
we know full well the players are not on top form . " " for this reason , i consider this match against sweden as merely a training exercise before the beginning of our european championships 2008 qualification campaign . " new coach facing injury headache löw is already facing his first test as national coach as his selection choices have been reduced by a spate of injuries , denying him the opportunity to face sweden with a full strength team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's new no.13 captain michael ballack is sidelined with a hip injury sustained in chelsea 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool on sunday while borussia dortmund duo christoph metzelder and sebastian kehl will also miss out with knee injuries .

with a quarter-final place up for grabs , germany ripped into sweden from the starting whistle of their round of 16 match and blew the scandinavians away with power , pace and precision . lukas podolski provided the finishing flourishes with two goals but it was the passion in the play from the outset which set the swedes up for the killer blow . jürgen klinsmann was in charge that day but when germany face sweden again on wednesday night , it will be his assistant , the new national coach joachim löw , who will be charged with instilling that passion in his young charges once more . löw 's debut as national coach in the friendly with sweden in gelsenkirchen has been trumpeted by some as the beginning of a new era .
while this may be true in the fact that he is not jürgen klinsmann , löw was an integral part of the set-up which took germany to a credible third place in the world cup just five weeks ago .

other interested parties , such as german prosecutors , will be there , too - for business , not pleasure . madonna 's " confessions " tour rolls into germany this weekend and while any performance by the original " material girl " going through her back catalogue of global hits is enough to attract widespread attention , her current sojourn through the stadiums of the world is prompting more than the average . the mother-of-two - who celebrates her 49th birthday wednesday - has never shied away from controversy and provocation ; after all , which other artist has continued to be hugely popular in spite of stunts such as her scandalously erotic sex book or the scenes of her smooching with a black jesus in the " like a prayer " video .
but her latest world tour may have actually reached the limits of good taste - and then crossed them . that 's what prosecutors in germany are intending to find out when madonna comes to town to play düsseldorf on sunday .
controversy over a mock crucifixion during the concert has dogged the tour so far , and the german regulators will be watching in an attempt to determine whether the scene could be construed as insulting religious beliefs . nailed on a " disco cross " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madonna pole-dancing in a skin-tight catsuit : a less provocative scene from her current show during the offensive section , madonna is hoisted onto what can be loosely termed a " disco cross " while wearing a crown of thorns .
the mock crucifixion has caused outrage in many of the countries in which the singer has performed during the tour to date . the vatican is especially upset .
cardinal ersilio tonino , speaking with the approval of the pope , recently called the concert " a blasphemous challenge to the faith " and a " profanation of the cross " after madonna had played rome .
he also called for madonna , who was raised as a catholic , to be excommunicated . madonna in blasphemy row - again " it is disrespectful , in bad taste and provocative , " added father manfredo leone from rome 's santa maria liberatrice church .
" being raised on a cross with a crown of thorns like a modern christ is absurd .
doing it in the cradle of christianity comes close to blasphemy . " the scene has also offended jewish and muslim leaders . " it is an idea in the worst possible taste and she would be better to return home , " suggested mario scajola , head of the italian muslim league , after the rome show . russia 's orthodox church accused madonna of exploiting christian symbols for her own ends and called for a boycott of her first-ever concert in moscow , when she played there earlier this month . " the us singer madonna exploits christian symbols - the cross , rosary beads and the crucifix - and tries to equate human passions , including her own personal passions , with something sacred , " the spokesman for the patriarch of moscow said in a statement . not disrespectful to church ... but world leaders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few moms can pull this off the singer 's spokeswoman , liz rosenberg , issued a statement in defense of the singer , denying that the star 's show was insulting .
" the context of madonna 's performance on the crucifix is neither negative nor disrespectful toward the church , " she said . the german authorities will make up their own minds on the crucifixion matter this weekend and also on whether the giant screen , which flashes images ranging from the pope , osama bin laden , us president george w. bush , chinese leader mao zedong to italian fascist dictator benito mussolini , is in bad taste . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politician 's blasphemy plan gets cool reception bavaria 's conservative premier stoiber recently proposed tightening germany 's blasphemy laws .

germany 's interior minister called for stricter rules on carry-on luggage . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble on wednesday called for an eu-wide ban on liquids in carry-on luggage on commercial air flights after a meeting of eu interior ministers in london . " based on what we know , we should actually prohibit the carrying of liquids in hand luggage , " schäuble said .
" they involve risks that we have n't been able to rule out so far with sufficient certainty . " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports last week that terrorists in britain were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . schäuble also appealed for a level of control and security that could be accepted as a permanent measure , without giving off the impression " that we are first reacting very hastily and then pretending that nothing has happened . " a unified policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's home secretary briefed his european counterparts on the uk terror investigation british interior minister john reid , who hosted the talks at the home office , urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union . " it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . the home secretary expressed regret over the flight disruptions caused by the tight security imposed since britain announced it had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners . " i want to thank my european colleagues but also the many visitors to this country who have put up with the inconvenience of the last few days , " reid said .
" it 's not possible to fight terrorism without inconvenience .
it 's deeply regretful if someone loses their baggage .
it 's far more regretful if they lose their life . " " it 's terrible if somebody is delayed , but a delay is more acceptable than death , " said the minister , flanked by schäuble and france 's interior minister , nicolas sarkozy . fighting terrorism is a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased security measures have led to flight delays and cancellations in the uk " the inconvenience has not been imposed for the sake of imposing it .
it has been imposed in order to defeat terrorism and to protect our public and that is what the three ministers have as our highest priority , " reid said . britain has said it is currently holding 24 people in custody in connection with the alleged plot .
the spotlight has turned on osama bin laden 's al qaeda group since britain on thursday swooped on suspects in pre-dawn raids . the british authorities investigating the case have since released one person and arrested another while pakistan says it could extradite rashid rauf , a british al qaeda suspect , to britain . the arrest of rauf and another briton earlier this month helped foil the alleged plot , pakistani officials say .
the white house , however , has stopped short of blaming al qaeda , saying only that the alleged plot " looks like something al qaeda would do . " a heightened threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicholas sarkozy sarkozy told reporters in london that there is " a pile of elements that make one think that the nebulous al qaeda is not far removed from what could have happened . " the french interior minister recalled that " a heightened threat " of terrorist attack remained in france " even if at the moment we speak , there is no known link with what could have happened in britain . " in addition to schäuble and sarkozy , also present were the interior ministers of finland , portugal and slovenia as well as the european commission vice president franco frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries . the home office said the meeting would " brief eu colleagues on the emerging threat and current operation , accelerate eu action where necessary , and re-affirm the eu 's commitment to counter-terrorism work .

us researchers compared 56 children with autism with 56 who did not have the condition .
those with autism were found to have more problems with complex tasks , such as tying their shoelaces , suggesting many areas of the brain were affected .
a uk autism expert said the child neuropsychology study showed how pervasive the condition was .
the social difficulties have received a great deal of research attention but this new study reminds us that the causes of autism have more pervasive effects professor simon baron cohen , autism research centre people with autism are traditionally identified as having problems interacting with others and with both verbal and non-verbal communication .
they can also display repetitive behaviours and have very focused interests .
but this study suggests autism can affect sensory perception , movement and memory because it prevents different parts of the brain working together to achieve complex tasks .
shoelaces ' difficult ' the children with autism all had the ability to speak , read and write .
all those studied by the team from the collaborative program of excellence in autism were aged eight to 15 .
while children with autism performed as well as , and sometimes better than , the other children in basic tests , they all had trouble with complex tasks .
so in the visual and spatial skills tests , children with autism were very good at finding small objects in a busy picture , such as finding the character waldo in the " where 's waldo " picture books series .
but when they were asked to tell the difference between similar-looking people , they found it very difficult .
and while children with autism tended to be very good at spelling and grammar , they found it much harder to understand complex figures of speech , such as idioms - where the meaning of the phrase is not the same as the actual words suggest .
for example , they would not understand " he kicked the bucket " as meaning someone had died and were likely to actually hop if told to " hop it " .
children with autism also had problems with their handwriting .
' faulty ' wiring nancy minshew , a specialist in psychiatry and neurology at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine , who led the research , said : " these findings show that you can not compartmentalise autism .
it 's much more complex .
she said researchers investigating autism needed to look for causes that affect multiple brain areas , rather than simply looking at areas related to communication and repetitive behaviours or obsessive interests .
dr minshew added : " our paper strongly suggests that autism is not primarily a disorder of social interaction but a global disorder affecting how the brain processes the information it receives - especially when the information becomes complicated . "
the team has previously found , through looking at brain scans , that people with autism have abnormalities in the neurological wiring through which brain areas communicate .
she said these abnormalities were the most likely explanation for why the children with autism in the current study had problems with complex tasks but did well in tasks that only required one region of the brain .
professor simon baron cohen , head of the autism research centre in cambridge , said : " this new study is important in highlighting atypical functioning in both social and non-social domains , by people with autism spectrum conditions .
" previously the social difficulties have received a great deal of research attention .
" but this new study reminds us that the causes of autism have more pervasive effects . "

while children with autism performed as well as , and sometimes better than , the other children in basic tests , they all had trouble with complex tasks .
so in the visual and spatial skills tests , children with autism were very good at finding small objects in a busy picture , such as finding the character waldo in the " where 's waldo " picture books series .
but when they were asked to tell the difference between similar-looking people , they found it very difficult .
and while children with autism tended to be very good at spelling and grammar , they found it much harder to understand complex figures of speech , such as idioms - where the meaning of the phrase is not the same as the actual words suggest .
for example , they would not understand " he kicked the bucket " as meaning someone had died and were likely to actually hop if told to " hop it " .
children with autism also had problems with their handwriting .
' faulty ' wiring nancy minshew , a specialist in psychiatry and neurology at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine , who led the research , said : " these findings show that you can not compartmentalise autism .
it 's much more complex .
she said researchers investigating autism needed to look for causes that affect multiple brain areas , rather than simply looking at areas related to communication and repetitive behaviours or obsessive interests .
dr minshew added : " our paper strongly suggests that autism is not primarily a disorder of social interaction but a global disorder affecting how the brain processes the information it receives - especially when the information becomes complicated . "
the team has previously found , through looking at brain scans , that people with autism have abnormalities in the neurological wiring through which brain areas communicate .
she said these abnormalities were the most likely explanation for why the children with autism in the current study had problems with complex tasks but did well in tasks that only required one region of the brain .
professor simon baron cohen , head of the autism research centre in cambridge , said : " this new study is important in highlighting atypical functioning in both social and non-social domains , by people with autism spectrum conditions .

us researchers compared 56 children with autism with 56 who did not have the condition .
those with autism were found to have more problems with complex tasks , such as tying their shoelaces , suggesting many areas of the brain were affected .
a uk autism expert said the child neuropsychology study showed how pervasive the condition was .
the social difficulties have received a great deal of research attention but this new study reminds us that the causes of autism have more pervasive effects professor simon baron cohen , autism research centre people with autism are traditionally identified as having problems interacting with others and with both verbal and non-verbal communication .
they can also display repetitive behaviours and have very focused interests .
but this study suggests autism can affect sensory perception , movement and memory because it prevents different parts of the brain working together to achieve complex tasks .

they have overtaken london as the most expensive places to live , once income is taken into account , the yougov poll for an insurance firm claims .
the study found people in the welsh capital commit an average 97 % of their monthly earnings to paying the bills .
for edinburgh , the figure was 93 % , while london was ninth at 73 % , after cities including leeds and southampton .
the study for insurance firm combined insurance used the annual survey of hours and earnings by the office of national statistics to compare people 's income with the outgoings of 2,000 people questioned .
cardiff topped the bill as the most expensive city , with those questioned saying they had to spend almost £ 1,059 per month on essential living costs .
almost £ 160 of a gross monthly salary of £ 1,088 went on servicing debts such as credit cards .
the cost of living 1 .

newcastle - 83 % 7 .

manchester - 75 % 9 .
london - 73 % monthly earnings in edinburgh averaged £ 142 more , but essential costs , such as utility bills , debt servicing , mortgage and food and travel expenses accounted for 93 % of it .
however , although londoners pay out most each month - £ 1,338 - their average monthly income of £ 1,809 puts their relative cost of living behind leeds , southampton , birmingham , newcastle , glasgow and manchester .
commuters nigel brittle , of combined insurance , said : " these findings call into question the long-held belief that london is the uk cost capital with an exorbitant cost of living .
" when monthly income is taken into account , and all monthly commitments are totted up - not just mortgages - it 's clear there are residents in other parts of the uk that are living closer to the financial edge . "
brian morgan , a regional economist at cardiff business school , queried the accuracy of the income figures for cardiff but said people in both it and edinburgh faced extra costs for living in capital cities .
he put the average income for the greater cardiff area at around £ 19,000 , claiming the city had a greater proportion of commuters from outside than london , with the neighbouring vale of glamorgan one of the highest income areas in wales .
he said : " cardiff and edinburgh are both seats of government and both have huge public sector departments .
" edinburgh has an even bigger financial services sector and with the oil offshore a much higher number of corporate headquarters .
it has seen an even more rapid increase in house price inflation than wales . "

they have overtaken london as the most expensive places to live , once income is taken into account , the yougov poll for an insurance firm claims .
the study found people in the welsh capital commit an average 97 % of their monthly earnings to paying the bills .
for edinburgh , the figure was 93 % , while london was ninth at 73 % , after cities including leeds and southampton .
the study for insurance firm combined insurance used the annual survey of hours and earnings by the office of national statistics to compare people 's income with the outgoings of 2,000 people questioned .
cardiff topped the bill as the most expensive city , with those questioned saying they had to spend almost £ 1,059 per month on essential living costs .
almost £ 160 of a gross monthly salary of £ 1,088 went on servicing debts such as credit cards .
the cost of living 1 .
cardiff - 97 % of earnings committed to outgoings 2 .
edinburgh - 93 % 3 .
leeds - 88 % 4 .
southampton - 87 % 5 .
birmingham - 85 % 6 .
newcastle - 83 % 7 .
glasgow - 80 % 8 .
manchester - 75 % 9 .
london - 73 % monthly earnings in edinburgh averaged £ 142 more , but essential costs , such as utility bills , debt servicing , mortgage and food and travel expenses accounted for 93 % of it .
however , although londoners pay out most each month - £ 1,338 - their average monthly income of £ 1,809 puts their relative cost of living behind leeds , southampton , birmingham , newcastle , glasgow and manchester .
commuters nigel brittle , of combined insurance , said : " these findings call into question the long-held belief that london is the uk cost capital with an exorbitant cost of living .
capital cities like edinburgh can have their price for residents " when monthly income is taken into account , and all monthly commitments are totted up - not just mortgages - it 's clear there are residents in other parts of the uk that are living closer to the financial edge . "
brian morgan , a regional economist at cardiff business school , queried the accuracy of the income figures for cardiff but said people in both it and edinburgh faced extra costs for living in capital cities .
he put the average income for the greater cardiff area at around £ 19,000 , claiming the city had a greater proportion of commuters from outside than london , with the neighbouring vale of glamorgan one of the highest income areas in wales .
he said : " cardiff and edinburgh are both seats of government and both have huge public sector departments .
" edinburgh has an even bigger financial services sector and with the oil offshore a much higher number of corporate headquarters .
it has seen an even more rapid increase in house price inflation than wales . "

official figures suggest the number of children being diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome has not changed dramatically over the last 10 years .
this represents only the severest cases , who are deformed at birth .
but some doctors think the extent of the problem may be masked by a common misdiagnosis of attention disorders .
behavioural problems paediatricians said they were diagnosing increasing numbers of children with learning difficulties and hyperactivity as a result of their mother 's drinking .
they say the true scale of the problem may be obscured by a common misdiagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , prescriptions for which have risen dramatically in recent years .

"
dr adrian margerison , a community paediatrician at borders general hospital , said that he had two cases of fas in 1984 , but now he has 10 .
he said : " i would have to say that all the 10 patients have varying degrees of attention deficit and at least half are quite hyperactive .
" there is undoubtedly a chance this is more common than we think . "
dr john mcclure , consultant paediatrician at crosshouse hospital in ayrshire , said that he had 30 children with degrees of fas .
he called for greater warnings to be issued with alcoholic drinks .

official figures suggest the number of children being diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome has not changed dramatically over the last 10 years .
this represents only the severest cases , who are deformed at birth .
but some doctors think the extent of the problem may be masked by a common misdiagnosis of attention disorders .
behavioural problems paediatricians said they were diagnosing increasing numbers of children with learning difficulties and hyperactivity as a result of their mother 's drinking .

and that starts a rollercoaster of emotions for pupils and their teachers .
for many teenagers gcse and a-level days are literally life-changing .
if they get the results they need , it 's off to university or college , and perhaps leaving home or starting work for the first time .
and if christmas is the busiest time of the year for vicars , then for us education correspondents , it 's those two weeks in august .
we broadcast live from a host school every year starting from when the staff receive the results in the early morning post , right through to that nail-biting moment of truth for the students .
taking the bbc into school is a huge operation .
all the main news outlets want to hear from us , from radio wales , to radio five , from wales today to news 24 , and of course they all want to see and hear that magic moment live - when the students are given those results .
if broadcasting that moment live sounds terrifying , well it is !
and not just for the students but also for the person holding the mic .
the good news is that we 've never had a student receive really bad news live on air - but plenty have looked as if they are about to faint or cry as they open the envelope .
i 'm not going to give the game away , but remember that the teachers see all the results before the students ... but those grades still come as a huge surprise to them and us .
an extra supply of tissues is an absolute must .
comprehensive picture for their teachers it 's the culmination of years of work .
as a reporter it 's great to see the realisation dawn on the faces of those young people .
for those students who do n't do quite so well , it could mean the end of a dream - or at least that dream being put on hold as they retake exams or rethink their future plans .
it 's then that you see the staff swing into action , helping the a-level students as they try to find an alternative university place through the clearing system , or counselling the gcse students as they try to decide what to do next .
of course one of our biggest audiences wo n't be watching the tv coverage , or listening on the radio , they 'll be reading about the results on our news website .
writing the story for readers is now as important as broadcasting it .
we 'll be providing a comprehensive picture about the results in wales and how they compare with previous years .
we 'll also hear directly from a-level and gcse students who 'll be writing about their own experiences before and after they get their results .

and that starts a rollercoaster of emotions for pupils and their teachers .
for many teenagers gcse and a-level days are literally life-changing .
if they get the results they need , it 's off to university or college , and perhaps leaving home or starting work for the first time .
and if christmas is the busiest time of the year for vicars , then for us education correspondents , it 's those two weeks in august .
we broadcast live from a host school every year starting from when the staff receive the results in the early morning post , right through to that nail-biting moment of truth for the students .
taking the bbc into school is a huge operation .
all the main news outlets want to hear from us , from radio wales , to radio five , from wales today to news 24 , and of course they all want to see and hear that magic moment live - when the students are given those results .
if broadcasting that moment live sounds terrifying , well it is !
and not just for the students but also for the person holding the mic .
the good news is that we 've never had a student receive really bad news live on air - but plenty have looked as if they are about to faint or cry as they open the envelope .
i 'm not going to give the game away , but remember that the teachers see all the results before the students ... but those grades still come as a huge surprise to them and us .
an extra supply of tissues is an absolute must .
comprehensive picture for their teachers it 's the culmination of years of work .
as a reporter it 's great to see the realisation dawn on the faces of those young people .
for those students who do n't do quite so well , it could mean the end of a dream - or at least that dream being put on hold as they retake exams or rethink their future plans .
it 's then that you see the staff swing into action , helping the a-level students as they try to find an alternative university place through the clearing system , or counselling the gcse students as they try to decide what to do next .
of course one of our biggest audiences wo n't be watching the tv coverage , or listening on the radio , they 'll be reading about the results on our news website .
writing the story for readers is now as important as broadcasting it .
we 'll be providing a comprehensive picture about the results in wales and how they compare with previous years .
we 'll also hear directly from a-level and gcse students who 'll be writing about their own experiences before and after they get their results .

an endorsement by astronomers meeting in prague would require school and university textbooks to be rewritten .
the proposal recognises eight classical planets , three planets belonging to a new category called " plutons " and the largest asteroid ceres .
pluto remains a planet , but becomes the basis for the new pluton category .
the plan has been drawn up by the international astronomical union -lrb- iau -rrb- with the aim of settling the question of what does and does not count as a planet .
some 2,500 astronomers gathered at the iau general assembly in prague will vote on the plan next thursday .
new era " for the first time in more than 75 years , we will be able to discover new planets in our solar system .
this is a fascinating prospect , " said richard binzel , a member of the iau planet definition committee which put together the proposal .
but the solution was not popular with all experts .
robin catchpole , from the institute of astronomy , cambridge , told the bbc : " the public are very clear about what they understand by ' planets ' .
those are the big , dominant bodies in the solar system that we 're all familiar with , the eight - or nine if you include pluto .
" i think including more is going to add confusion to the public , but not really be particularly useful for astronomers . "
pluto was discovered in 1930 by us astronomer clyde tombaugh more details experts have been divided over whether pluto - further away and considerably smaller than the eight other planets in our solar system - deserves the title .
since the early 1990s , astronomers have found several other objects of comparable size to pluto in an outer region of the solar system called the kuiper belt .
some astronomers believe pluto belongs with this population of small , icy " trans-neptunians " , not with the objects we call planets .
for the first time in more than 75 years , we will be able to discover new planets in our solar system richard binzel , iau send us your comments allowances could once be made for pluto on account of its size .
at just 2,360km -lrb- 1,467 miles -rrb- across , pluto is significantly smaller than the other planets .
but until recently , it was still the biggest known object in the kuiper belt .
that changed with the discovery of 2003 ub313 by professor mike brown and colleagues at the california institute of technology -lrb- caltech -rrb- .
after being measured with the hubble space telescope , it was shown to be some 3,000km -lrb- 1,864 miles -rrb- in diameter , making it larger than the ninth planet .
kicked upstairs ?
the iau draft resolution recognises eight " classical " planets - mercury , venus , earth , mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune - three " plutons " - pluto , charon and ub313 - and the asteroid ceres .
charon is currently described as a moon of pluto , but because of its size some experts consider it a twin planet .
2003 ub313 : bigger than pluto professor owen gingerich , who chairs the iau planet definition committee , said : " in a sense we 're demoting pluto by taking it off the list of classical planets .
but we 're promoting it by making it the prototype of this new category of plutons . "
dr andrew coates of the mullard space science laboratory in dorking said : " something had to be done about the definition .
it does change the textbooks somewhat , but it also demonstrates that this is a vibrant area of research .
" the surprise is ceres , because most people thought of it as an asteroid . "
ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter , and like a planet is spherical in shape .
" this a step backward , " said alan boss , an astrophysicist at the carnegie institution in washington dc .
" it 's a demotion of the word planet . "
the carnegie researcher , who believes there are only eight true planets , said the term would lose its prestige under the proposed definition because anything round of a certain size could join the club .
" folks are n't going to have to worry about learning the planets anymore because it 's a list that does n't mean anything , " he said .
seeking endorsement the basis for this re-evaluation is a new scientific definition of a planet which uses gravity as the determining factor .
according to this definition , two conditions must be satisfied for an object to qualify as a planet : the object must be in orbit around a star , but must not itself be a star it must have enough mass for the body 's own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape on whether he was confident the resolution would be passed , professor gingerich told the bbc news website : " it will be a very awkward situation if they do n't .

that 's a good cross-section of astronomers .
" i 'm sure it will be controversial to those with a stake in some other solution , but i hope we will get an overwhelming endorsement . "
more objects are likely to be announced as planets in the future .
the iau has a " watchlist " of at least a dozen other potential candidates that could become planets once more is known about their sizes and orbits .
these include the distant objects sedna , orcus , quaoar and 2003 el61 and the asteroids vesta , pallas and hygiea .
the iau spent two years debating the matter among its membership .
a seven-member committee was set up to consider the findings and produce a draft proposal .
the body has been responsible for the naming of planets and moons since 1919 .

te arikinui dame te atairangikaahu died on tuesday at the age of 75 , after a reign of more than 40 years .
according to maori protocol , the lavish ceremonies will culminate in her burial on the sacred mountain of taupiri .
she was the longest serving head of the kingitanga movement - the royal line , which started almost 150 years ago .
the movement was started in an effort to stem the loss of native lands to the flood of white settlers arriving in new zealand .
' quiet dignity ' dame te ata , as she was popularly known , died in her ancestral home in the north island town of ngaruawahia late on tuesday .
hundreds of mourners have already congregated in the area to pay their respects .
nanaia mahuta , family spokeswoman for dame te ata , told new zealand media that dame te ata was " tireless in terms of ensuring there was a good relationships throughout all peoples of new zealand . "
new zealand prime minister helen clark said : " a mighty kauri -lrb- tree -rrb- has fallen . "
dame te ata was the longest serving head of the kingitanga movement , gaining the title of queen the day her father was buried in 1966 .
though the position is largely ceremonial , she enjoyed huge respect among both maori and other new zealanders - and was often consulted by senior politicians .
she was also recognised abroad as a cultural ambassador for the maori people - and met many diplomatic and royal visitors .
her successor is expected to be named during the week of mourning .
if tradition is followed , one of her seven children will inherit the post .
in a rare interview , given in march 2003 , she hinted that one of her sons would be chosen .
" my feeling at the moment is that the people are ready for a male heir to take over , " she said .
the maori people make up about 15 % of new zealand 's four million people .

dell is to recall 4.1 million of its notebook computer batteries because of the problem .
sony said it did not know how much the problem would cost but that it had " taken steps to address the situation ... to dell 's satisfaction " .
the computer maker said it would continue using sony as a supplier .
most of the lithium-ion batteries are in computers sold in the us .
however , more than one million are thought to be elsewhere .
dell says it knows of six instances since december when the batteries , made by sony , overheated or caught fire .
different concerns the problem batteries were made by sony energy devices based in fukushima , north of tokyo , and were placed in laptops shipped between april 2004 and july 2006 .
batteries used in sony 's own laptops do not cause the same concerns because the problems only develop when used with specific types of computer , a sony spokesman said .
in wednesday trading , sony shares fell as much as 2 % at one point before recovering , closing 1.2 % down on the day at 5,150 yen -lrb- $ 44 ; £ 23.45 -rrb- .
morgan stanley estimated that if sony had to pay all the expenses of the recall , it could reach 50 billion yen .
the consumer products safety commission -lrb- cpsc -rrb- , the us body responsible for consumer safety , says it is the biggest recall of electrical products in its history .
a cpsc spokesman said users of affected laptops should only run the machines on a power cord .
alex gurzen , the vice-president of dell 's product group , told the bbc the firm wanted to " put customer safety first despite this being a small handful of incidents " .

knowles was not due to record and release the follow-up to her massively successful solo debut dangerously in love , which earned five grammys and 11m sales , until next year .
but shortly after finishing filming dreamgirls earlier this year , she abandoned a holiday to enter the recording studio .
" i could n't help it .
i just had to go in the studio , i had so many ideas in my head , " she tells the bbc news website .
" it ended up being 22 songs recorded in two weeks , and i did three songs a day and i was in the zone . "
frustrated dreamgirls is based on a 1981 broadway musical about a 60s and 70s girl group , with knowles playing one of the members of the dreamettes , said to be loosely based on the supremes .
" i tried to really become this character , " she says . "
i sang with more emotion than on any of my other records " " i did n't allow myself any time to go in the studio or make personal appearances because i did n't want to get myself confused with deena , who was the character i was playing . "
with no outlet for her musical creativity during the six-month shoot she " felt really bottled up " , she admits .
the burst of creativity that followed the end of filming was also a response to the frustrations of her character , who " forgot completely who she was and lived her dreams through her husband " , says knowles .
" everything that she kind of put up with i felt like i put up with for those six months , and i had so much to say . "
secret recordings knowles took the unusual step of not telling her music label or management that she was recording , to avoid any expectations surrounding the unscheduled sessions .
" it was definitely liberating - i felt really free , " she says .
" it did n't feel like i was trying to make an album , i just had fun . "
but she adds : " i 'm in a very calm place in my life but if you heard the record you might think that i was not , because it 's very aggressive .
" i am saying all the things that i wish my character would have said . "
while this means the songs are not directly about her own experiences , the former destiny 's child star believes they are the most powerful of her career .
" i am speaking for every woman .
it 's a celebration of a woman being really strong and knowing what she wants , and what she 's worth and not putting up with things that she does n't need to put up with .
" i sang a lot , i belted a lot , i growled a lot - i sang with more emotion than on any of my other records . "
birthday girl in keeping with the album 's celebratory feel , a worldwide release date was set to coincide with knowles ' birthday on 4 september , and is appropriately entitled b 'day .
the singer , who will be 25 , is due to tour on the back of the album from next april .
in the meantime , dreamgirls ' arrival in cinemas worldwide from december could mark knowles ' emergence as a credible actress .
" it just was everything that you dream of in a character , " says knowles , whose best-known film work has been in the comedies austin powers in goldmember and the pink panther .
" i am able to be funny , i am able to be manipulative , and a little evil , and really sincere and sensitive , and there are really dramatic scenes where i am emotional - i get to do all these things and show that i 'm an actor .
" i wanted to prove to myself that if i 'm given the opportunity and if i spend as much time and am as focused about acting as i am singing then i can do it .
" i would have done it for free , " she adds .
