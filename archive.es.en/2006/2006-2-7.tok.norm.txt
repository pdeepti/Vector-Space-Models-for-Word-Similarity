statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .
" and it helps their image , both inside and outside the firm .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

31 the german government has no news so far of two german hostages in iraq after a friday-night deadline set by their captors expired .
berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .
but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .
the chairman of the islamic council in germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in a newspaper on monday that it was regrettable that religion was being abused once again and all of islam brought into disrepute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in the hostages ' hometown of leipzig have expressed their solidarity nadeem elyas , former head of the central council of muslims in germany recalled germany 's fierce opposition to the iraq war saying the two german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . that organization 's new leader , ayyub axel köhler , has said the group is ready to offer assistance to secure the hostages ' release . " we may have possibilities that others do not have .
we are ready to help , " he said , adding that he was surprised that berlin had no been able to make progress in the case .
" it is astonishing that the german government , with all its staff and its crisis unit which has done such excellent work , has not been able to achieve that . " worries about effects of caricatures german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has praised all efforts that are being made but adds that it is unknown whether the hostages are even still alive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier has had little news to report on the crisis " germany as a whole is deeply concerned , including of course the government , " he said .
" we 've been trying to establish contact with the kidnappers for many days , but our efforts have failed so far .
that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried .

they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2006 german translators take their case for better pay to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translating is hard work - and poorly paid , too they are the starvelings of literature : translators .
but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .

however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus .

in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases .

six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .

this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .

secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark europe -pipe- 07.02.2006 europe no stranger to blasphemy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone likes depictions of jesus by austrian cartoonist gerhard haderer violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .
but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen . " you have to ask yourself what kind of statement you 're making once the satirical elements have been stripped away , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark osama al-habahbeh has been in the thick of the controversy over the cartoons published in danish newspaper " jyllands-posten " that have enraged muslims worldwide - both as a reporter and as a danish muslim .

but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen . " you have to ask yourself what kind of statement you 're making once the satirical elements have been stripped away , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark osama al-habahbeh has been in the thick of the controversy over the cartoons published in danish newspaper " jyllands-posten " that have enraged muslims worldwide - both as a reporter and as a danish muslim .

asian muslims also spoke out as tensions simmered there . hundreds of demonstrators attacked two european embassies in iran and the regime halted trade with denmark , amid continued protests over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . governments and international bodies , including those of some islamic asian nations , called for calm and compromise .
and from brussels to tokyo to moscow to washington , non-muslim leaders sought an elusive balance between mollifying muslims outraged by irreverent caricatures of islam 's prophet , and upholding the principles of free speech . in the public arena , however , passions remained dangerously inflamed , with worldwide demonstrations against the cartoons causing at least five deaths and dozens of injuries and arrests . white house condemns ' hate speech ' the white house said it understood islamic anger but added that muslims must also condemn anti-semitic and anti-christian " hate speech . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian demonstrators torched the danish embassy in damascus " we understand fully why people , why muslims , find the cartoons offensive , " spokesman scott mcclellan said , while upholding " the right of people to express their views , and freedom of speech in society .

demonstrators threw hand grenades at the offices of a norwegian reconstruction team in the city of maymana , deputy governor sayed ahmad sayed said . protests also raged in algeria and nigeria , and a danish aid group was forced to halt activities in the stricken darfur region of sudan . syria rejected denmark 's accusations it had not done enough to protect its embassy in damascus , a minister saying that police had tried to shield it with their " bodies and blood . " denmark has been the chief target of muslim fury as it was a danish newspaper that first printed the 12 caricatures of mohammed , last september .
since then they have appeared in newspapers in many western countries , though not those of britain and the us . iran calls for ' holocaust cartoons ' in the violence in tehran , after first smashing and torching the facade of the embassy of austria -lrb- currently european union president -rrb- , a group of some 400 student members of the islamic hard-line basij militia moved on to denmark 's diplomatic compound and attempted a full-scale assault . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kuwait , danish products are already off many shelves iranian commerce minister masoud mir-kazemi announced a total ban on danish imports as well as any other business dealings with the country " until further notice .

they did n't think things through .
they have been irresponsible as they know this kind of action can lead to ill-feelings , " he was quoted as saying by the official bernama news agency . west calls for calm elsewhere in the world , charge and countercharge continued with many european governments condemning the violence and expressing sympathy with denmark .
voices on both sides urged calm . the european council of religious leaders , which groups representatives of all europe 's religions , condemned both the publication of the cartoon and the ensuing violence in the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslim protestors rallied in front of the danish embassy monday in brussels , the european commission denounced the latest wave of violence and called for calm on all sides .

the russian government condemned the arab attacks on diplomatic missions but voiced sympathy for muslims offended by the controversial cartoons . in new zealand , prime minister helen clark criticized the decision by several media outlets to publish the cartoons , saying it has put the country 's people at risk . three new zealand newspapers and two television channels have reproduced the cartoons .
clark said the country 's newspapers had the right to publish what they wanted , but called their decision to reproduce the caricatures " ill-judged " and " gratuitous .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .

this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .

" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .

31 the german government has no news so far of two german hostages in iraq after a friday-night deadline set by their captors expired .
berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .
but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .
the chairman of the islamic council in germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in a newspaper on monday that it was regrettable that religion was being abused once again and all of islam brought into disrepute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in the hostages ' hometown of leipzig have expressed their solidarity nadeem elyas , former head of the central council of muslims in germany recalled germany 's fierce opposition to the iraq war saying the two german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . that organization 's new leader , ayyub axel köhler , has said the group is ready to offer assistance to secure the hostages ' release . " we may have possibilities that others do not have .
we are ready to help , " he said , adding that he was surprised that berlin had no been able to make progress in the case .
" it is astonishing that the german government , with all its staff and its crisis unit which has done such excellent work , has not been able to achieve that . " worries about effects of caricatures german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has praised all efforts that are being made but adds that it is unknown whether the hostages are even still alive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier has had little news to report on the crisis " germany as a whole is deeply concerned , including of course the government , " he said .
" we 've been trying to establish contact with the kidnappers for many days , but our efforts have failed so far .
that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .
but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .
the chairman of the islamic council in germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in a newspaper on monday that it was regrettable that religion was being abused once again and all of islam brought into disrepute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in the hostages ' hometown of leipzig have expressed their solidarity nadeem elyas , former head of the central council of muslims in germany recalled germany 's fierce opposition to the iraq war saying the two german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . that organization 's new leader , ayyub axel köhler , has said the group is ready to offer assistance to secure the hostages ' release . " we may have possibilities that others do not have .
we are ready to help , " he said , adding that he was surprised that berlin had no been able to make progress in the case .
" it is astonishing that the german government , with all its staff and its crisis unit which has done such excellent work , has not been able to achieve that . " worries about effects of caricatures german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has praised all efforts that are being made but adds that it is unknown whether the hostages are even still alive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier has had little news to report on the crisis " germany as a whole is deeply concerned , including of course the government , " he said .
" we 've been trying to establish contact with the kidnappers for many days , but our efforts have failed so far .
that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

a male nurse , nicknamed the " angel of death , " went on trial for murder over the deaths of 29 patients . twenty-seven-year old stephan letter went on trial tuesday over the deaths of 29 mostly elderly patients in what may have been the worst killing spree in postwar german history . the defendant - nicknamed the " angel of death " by the german press - admitted when he was arrested in july 2004 to killing 12 patients in his care by lethal injection at a clinic in the town of sonthofen , in the bavarian alps . ' saving ' the dying he told police the killings had been acts of mercy to " save " dying people from their suffering .
investigators subsequently dug up 42 graves of people who died at the clinic in sonthofen for autopsies , in some cases against the fierce resistance of their loved ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cemetery workers exhumed bodies for evidence in the case the nurse was then charged with 16 counts of murder , 12 of manslaughter and one count of killing on demand .
if convicted , letter could face life in prison . the deaths began in february 2003 , less than a month after the nurse started working there , and all the patients died during letter 's 17 months at the sonthofen clinic .
the majority were 75 years of age or older , though the youngest was only 40 . the deaths of the patients raised no suspicion at the time , but the police were called in because medication had disappeared from the clinic .
stephan l. was finally arrested when they found medicine at his home which the state prosecutor in the southern city of kempten , where the trial is taking place , said was enough to kill 10 people . ' indiscriminate , aimless ' acts the prosecution said that stephan l. had maliciously ended the lives even of patients who were recovering and in some cases stole their belongings . " he acted relatively indiscriminately and aimlessly , " said wilhelm seitz , a lawyer who is representing relatives of 11 of the dead as co-plaintiffs in the case , speaking to the associated press news service . " not all of the patients were seriously ill , and he had had no contact at all with some of them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2006 german translators take their case for better pay to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translating is hard work - and poorly paid , too they are the starvelings of literature : translators .
but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

" however a court case brought against the paper that printed the danish cartoons by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out , with the judges considering that the issue of freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . norway has a public order law dating from the 1930s which in principle outlaws blasphemy on pain of up to six months in jail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.02.2006 convicted terror suspect released from german prison großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq -lrb- left -rrb- was released from prison tuesday evening a morroccan national convicted of aiding a terrorist organization in connection with the sept .
11 attacks has been released from prison pending his appeal . mounir el-motassadeq was sentenced to seven years in prison by a hamburg court last august .
he was convicted of belonging to a terrorist cell that included three sept .
11 hijackers .
but on tuesday , following a decision by germany 's federal constitutional court , motassadeq walked out of the hamburg prison and got into his lawyer 's car .
he smiled but made no comment .
a statement from the federal court said that hamburg judges had been wrong to order motassadeq returned to custody while appeals from both his defense lawyers and prosecutors are still pending .
in 2003 , the 31-year-old moroccan was first sentenced to 15 years in prison as the first person anywhere to be convicted in connection with the sept .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .
" and it helps their image , both inside and outside the firm .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .
" and it helps their image , both inside and outside the firm .

but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen .

a male nurse , nicknamed the " angel of death , " went on trial for murder over the deaths of 29 patients . twenty-seven-year old stephan letter went on trial tuesday over the deaths of 29 mostly elderly patients in what may have been the worst killing spree in postwar german history . the defendant - nicknamed the " angel of death " by the german press - admitted when he was arrested in july 2004 to killing 12 patients in his care by lethal injection at a clinic in the town of sonthofen , in the bavarian alps . ' saving ' the dying he told police the killings had been acts of mercy to " save " dying people from their suffering .
investigators subsequently dug up 42 graves of people who died at the clinic in sonthofen for autopsies , in some cases against the fierce resistance of their loved ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cemetery workers exhumed bodies for evidence in the case the nurse was then charged with 16 counts of murder , 12 of manslaughter and one count of killing on demand .
if convicted , letter could face life in prison . the deaths began in february 2003 , less than a month after the nurse started working there , and all the patients died during letter 's 17 months at the sonthofen clinic .
the majority were 75 years of age or older , though the youngest was only 40 . the deaths of the patients raised no suspicion at the time , but the police were called in because medication had disappeared from the clinic .
stephan l. was finally arrested when they found medicine at his home which the state prosecutor in the southern city of kempten , where the trial is taking place , said was enough to kill 10 people . ' indiscriminate , aimless ' acts the prosecution said that stephan l. had maliciously ended the lives even of patients who were recovering and in some cases stole their belongings . " he acted relatively indiscriminately and aimlessly , " said wilhelm seitz , a lawyer who is representing relatives of 11 of the dead as co-plaintiffs in the case , speaking to the associated press news service . " not all of the patients were seriously ill , and he had had no contact at all with some of them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2006 europe 's blasphemy laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art involving crucifixes has been prosecuted in some european countries some muslim leaders have urged europe to use blasphemy laws against newspapers that publish cartoons containing representations of the prophet mohammed .
here 's a look at the differing laws in european countries . in bangladesh , minister for industry matiur rahman nizami was quoted in the press as telling the european union that if christianity and jesus christ were protected by blasphemy laws , then there was no justification for those laws not being used to protect the rights of muslims . in lebanon .
sheikh hassan nasrallah , the head of the radical hezbollah movement , on friday called on european parliaments to pass laws " prohibiting the media from attacking god and the prophets . " here 's a brief overview of laws on blasphemy and incitation to religious hatred in european countries : de n mark , where the mohammed cartoons were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however a court case brought against the paper that printed the danish cartoons by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out , with the judges considering that the issue of freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . norway has a public order law dating from the 1930s which in principle outlaws blasphemy on pain of up to six months in jail .
but it is never used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salman rushdie in britai n there is an old , little-used law against blasphemy , and a new law that outlaws incitation to religious hatred .
however the former explicitly applies only to the anglican church , as muslim leaders discovered when they tried to use it against the writer salman rushdie for his novel " the satanic verses " , published in 2000 .
the terms of reference of the new law on religious hatred have been kept deliberately narrow , to take in only acts or words explicitly aimed at sparking violence . germa n y has an anti-blasphemy law dating from 1871 , but it has been little used in recent decades .
it was however successfully used in 1994 to ban a musical comedy that ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs . fra n ce outlawed blasphemy at the time of its revolution in the late 18th century ; the law has never been reinstated . neither spai n nor portugal have anti-blasphemy laws , although both have little-used legislation on religious hatred . italy has a law against " outrage to a religion , " which has recently been used against the journalist oriana fallaci over her outspoken statements and writings on islam .
that case , which adds a charge of " incitation to inter-religious hatred , " is still pending . the netherla n ds has a law proscribing what is called " scornful blasphemy , " and providing for up three months in jail and a fine of 70 euros -lrb- $ 85 -rrb- the last major case brought under the law was in 1968 against a writer who wrote a poem about having sex with god .
the case was eventually thrown out of court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian cartoonist gerhard haderer 's depictions of jesus have been criticized austria n law prohibits the ridiculing of a religion , on pain of up to six months in jail .
but no attempt was made to use it last year when a book of cartoons was published depicting the christian prophet jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie . pola n d , an overwhelmingly catholic country , has a legal provision against publicly offending a person 's religious feelings , with up to two years in prison .
artist dorota nieznalska , is currently being sued under the law for a sculpture in which male genitals were shown attached to a christian crucifix . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jesus comic enrages greeks a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .

31 the german government has no news so far of two german hostages in iraq after a friday-night deadline set by their captors expired .
berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .
but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .
the chairman of the islamic council in germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in a newspaper on monday that it was regrettable that religion was being abused once again and all of islam brought into disrepute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in the hostages ' hometown of leipzig have expressed their solidarity nadeem elyas , former head of the central council of muslims in germany recalled germany 's fierce opposition to the iraq war saying the two german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . that organization 's new leader , ayyub axel köhler , has said the group is ready to offer assistance to secure the hostages ' release . " we may have possibilities that others do not have .
we are ready to help , " he said , adding that he was surprised that berlin had no been able to make progress in the case .
" it is astonishing that the german government , with all its staff and its crisis unit which has done such excellent work , has not been able to achieve that . " worries about effects of caricatures german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has praised all efforts that are being made but adds that it is unknown whether the hostages are even still alive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier has had little news to report on the crisis " germany as a whole is deeply concerned , including of course the government , " he said .
" we 've been trying to establish contact with the kidnappers for many days , but our efforts have failed so far .
that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .

berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .
but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .
the chairman of the islamic council in germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in a newspaper on monday that it was regrettable that religion was being abused once again and all of islam brought into disrepute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in the hostages ' hometown of leipzig have expressed their solidarity nadeem elyas , former head of the central council of muslims in germany recalled germany 's fierce opposition to the iraq war saying the two german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . that organization 's new leader , ayyub axel köhler , has said the group is ready to offer assistance to secure the hostages ' release . " we may have possibilities that others do not have .
we are ready to help , " he said , adding that he was surprised that berlin had no been able to make progress in the case .
" it is astonishing that the german government , with all its staff and its crisis unit which has done such excellent work , has not been able to achieve that . " worries about effects of caricatures german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has praised all efforts that are being made but adds that it is unknown whether the hostages are even still alive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier has had little news to report on the crisis " germany as a whole is deeply concerned , including of course the government , " he said .
" we 've been trying to establish contact with the kidnappers for many days , but our efforts have failed so far .
that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2006 german translators take their case for better pay to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translating is hard work - and poorly paid , too they are the starvelings of literature : translators .
but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

here 's a look at the differing laws in european countries . in bangladesh , minister for industry matiur rahman nizami was quoted in the press as telling the european union that if christianity and jesus christ were protected by blasphemy laws , then there was no justification for those laws not being used to protect the rights of muslims . in lebanon .
sheikh hassan nasrallah , the head of the radical hezbollah movement , on friday called on european parliaments to pass laws " prohibiting the media from attacking god and the prophets . " here 's a brief overview of laws on blasphemy and incitation to religious hatred in european countries : de n mark , where the mohammed cartoons were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however a court case brought against the paper that printed the danish cartoons by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out , with the judges considering that the issue of freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . norway has a public order law dating from the 1930s which in principle outlaws blasphemy on pain of up to six months in jail .
but it is never used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salman rushdie in britai n there is an old , little-used law against blasphemy , and a new law that outlaws incitation to religious hatred .
however the former explicitly applies only to the anglican church , as muslim leaders discovered when they tried to use it against the writer salman rushdie for his novel " the satanic verses " , published in 2000 .
the terms of reference of the new law on religious hatred have been kept deliberately narrow , to take in only acts or words explicitly aimed at sparking violence . germa n y has an anti-blasphemy law dating from 1871 , but it has been little used in recent decades .
it was however successfully used in 1994 to ban a musical comedy that ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs . fra n ce outlawed blasphemy at the time of its revolution in the late 18th century ; the law has never been reinstated . neither spai n nor portugal have anti-blasphemy laws , although both have little-used legislation on religious hatred . italy has a law against " outrage to a religion , " which has recently been used against the journalist oriana fallaci over her outspoken statements and writings on islam .
that case , which adds a charge of " incitation to inter-religious hatred , " is still pending . the netherla n ds has a law proscribing what is called " scornful blasphemy , " and providing for up three months in jail and a fine of 70 euros -lrb- $ 85 -rrb- the last major case brought under the law was in 1968 against a writer who wrote a poem about having sex with god .
the case was eventually thrown out of court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian cartoonist gerhard haderer 's depictions of jesus have been criticized austria n law prohibits the ridiculing of a religion , on pain of up to six months in jail .
but no attempt was made to use it last year when a book of cartoons was published depicting the christian prophet jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie . pola n d , an overwhelmingly catholic country , has a legal provision against publicly offending a person 's religious feelings , with up to two years in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany eu takes slow road to gender equity work-life balance gets boost in germany changing the rules of the men-only game news -pipe- 07.02.2006 " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which one will make it to the top ?
statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .
" and it helps their image , both inside and outside the firm .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark europe -pipe- 07.02.2006 europe no stranger to blasphemy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone likes depictions of jesus by austrian cartoonist gerhard haderer violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .
but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen . " you have to ask yourself what kind of statement you 're making once the satirical elements have been stripped away , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark osama al-habahbeh has been in the thick of the controversy over the cartoons published in danish newspaper " jyllands-posten " that have enraged muslims worldwide - both as a reporter and as a danish muslim .

six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .

in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run .

but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .

a male nurse , nicknamed the " angel of death , " went on trial for murder over the deaths of 29 patients . twenty-seven-year old stephan letter went on trial tuesday over the deaths of 29 mostly elderly patients in what may have been the worst killing spree in postwar german history . the defendant - nicknamed the " angel of death " by the german press - admitted when he was arrested in july 2004 to killing 12 patients in his care by lethal injection at a clinic in the town of sonthofen , in the bavarian alps . ' saving ' the dying he told police the killings had been acts of mercy to " save " dying people from their suffering .

the majority were 75 years of age or older , though the youngest was only 40 . the deaths of the patients raised no suspicion at the time , but the police were called in because medication had disappeared from the clinic .

' indiscriminate , aimless ' acts the prosecution said that stephan l. had maliciously ended the lives even of patients who were recovering and in some cases stole their belongings . " he acted relatively indiscriminately and aimlessly , " said wilhelm seitz , a lawyer who is representing relatives of 11 of the dead as co-plaintiffs in the case , speaking to the associated press news service . " not all of the patients were seriously ill , and he had had no contact at all with some of them .

berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .
but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .

that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity business -pipe- 07.02.2006 background : german antidiscrimination law still in the works großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justitia may watch over the law , but women still lack protection against discrimination germany has been working on an antidiscrimination law , as required by the european union .
it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .

but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2006 german translators take their case for better pay to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translating is hard work - and poorly paid , too they are the starvelings of literature : translators .
but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2006 german translators take their case for better pay to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translating is hard work - and poorly paid , too they are the starvelings of literature : translators .
but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .

but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark europe -pipe- 07.02.2006 europe no stranger to blasphemy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone likes depictions of jesus by austrian cartoonist gerhard haderer violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .
but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen .

a male nurse , nicknamed the " angel of death , " went on trial for murder over the deaths of 29 patients . twenty-seven-year old stephan letter went on trial tuesday over the deaths of 29 mostly elderly patients in what may have been the worst killing spree in postwar german history . the defendant - nicknamed the " angel of death " by the german press - admitted when he was arrested in july 2004 to killing 12 patients in his care by lethal injection at a clinic in the town of sonthofen , in the bavarian alps . ' saving ' the dying he told police the killings had been acts of mercy to " save " dying people from their suffering .
investigators subsequently dug up 42 graves of people who died at the clinic in sonthofen for autopsies , in some cases against the fierce resistance of their loved ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cemetery workers exhumed bodies for evidence in the case the nurse was then charged with 16 counts of murder , 12 of manslaughter and one count of killing on demand .
if convicted , letter could face life in prison . the deaths began in february 2003 , less than a month after the nurse started working there , and all the patients died during letter 's 17 months at the sonthofen clinic .
the majority were 75 years of age or older , though the youngest was only 40 . the deaths of the patients raised no suspicion at the time , but the police were called in because medication had disappeared from the clinic .
stephan l. was finally arrested when they found medicine at his home which the state prosecutor in the southern city of kempten , where the trial is taking place , said was enough to kill 10 people . ' indiscriminate , aimless ' acts the prosecution said that stephan l. had maliciously ended the lives even of patients who were recovering and in some cases stole their belongings . " he acted relatively indiscriminately and aimlessly , " said wilhelm seitz , a lawyer who is representing relatives of 11 of the dead as co-plaintiffs in the case , speaking to the associated press news service .

a male nurse , nicknamed the " angel of death , " went on trial for murder over the deaths of 29 patients . twenty-seven-year old stephan letter went on trial tuesday over the deaths of 29 mostly elderly patients in what may have been the worst killing spree in postwar german history . the defendant - nicknamed the " angel of death " by the german press - admitted when he was arrested in july 2004 to killing 12 patients in his care by lethal injection at a clinic in the town of sonthofen , in the bavarian alps . ' saving ' the dying he told police the killings had been acts of mercy to " save " dying people from their suffering .

the majority were 75 years of age or older , though the youngest was only 40 . the deaths of the patients raised no suspicion at the time , but the police were called in because medication had disappeared from the clinic .

berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .

" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .

that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .

that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .

the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2006 german translators take their case for better pay to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translating is hard work - and poorly paid , too they are the starvelings of literature : translators .
but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2006 europe 's blasphemy laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art involving crucifixes has been prosecuted in some european countries some muslim leaders have urged europe to use blasphemy laws against newspapers that publish cartoons containing representations of the prophet mohammed .
here 's a look at the differing laws in european countries . in bangladesh , minister for industry matiur rahman nizami was quoted in the press as telling the european union that if christianity and jesus christ were protected by blasphemy laws , then there was no justification for those laws not being used to protect the rights of muslims . in lebanon .
sheikh hassan nasrallah , the head of the radical hezbollah movement , on friday called on european parliaments to pass laws " prohibiting the media from attacking god and the prophets . " here 's a brief overview of laws on blasphemy and incitation to religious hatred in european countries : de n mark , where the mohammed cartoons were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however a court case brought against the paper that printed the danish cartoons by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out , with the judges considering that the issue of freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . norway has a public order law dating from the 1930s which in principle outlaws blasphemy on pain of up to six months in jail .
but it is never used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salman rushdie in britai n there is an old , little-used law against blasphemy , and a new law that outlaws incitation to religious hatred .
however the former explicitly applies only to the anglican church , as muslim leaders discovered when they tried to use it against the writer salman rushdie for his novel " the satanic verses " , published in 2000 .
the terms of reference of the new law on religious hatred have been kept deliberately narrow , to take in only acts or words explicitly aimed at sparking violence . germa n y has an anti-blasphemy law dating from 1871 , but it has been little used in recent decades .
it was however successfully used in 1994 to ban a musical comedy that ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs . fra n ce outlawed blasphemy at the time of its revolution in the late 18th century ; the law has never been reinstated . neither spai n nor portugal have anti-blasphemy laws , although both have little-used legislation on religious hatred . italy has a law against " outrage to a religion , " which has recently been used against the journalist oriana fallaci over her outspoken statements and writings on islam .
that case , which adds a charge of " incitation to inter-religious hatred , " is still pending . the netherla n ds has a law proscribing what is called " scornful blasphemy , " and providing for up three months in jail and a fine of 70 euros -lrb- $ 85 -rrb- the last major case brought under the law was in 1968 against a writer who wrote a poem about having sex with god .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .

asian muslims also spoke out as tensions simmered there . hundreds of demonstrators attacked two european embassies in iran and the regime halted trade with denmark , amid continued protests over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . governments and international bodies , including those of some islamic asian nations , called for calm and compromise .
and from brussels to tokyo to moscow to washington , non-muslim leaders sought an elusive balance between mollifying muslims outraged by irreverent caricatures of islam 's prophet , and upholding the principles of free speech . in the public arena , however , passions remained dangerously inflamed , with worldwide demonstrations against the cartoons causing at least five deaths and dozens of injuries and arrests . white house condemns ' hate speech ' the white house said it understood islamic anger but added that muslims must also condemn anti-semitic and anti-christian " hate speech . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian demonstrators torched the danish embassy in damascus " we understand fully why people , why muslims , find the cartoons offensive , " spokesman scott mcclellan said , while upholding " the right of people to express their views , and freedom of speech in society . " after a weekend that saw denmark 's embassies torched in lebanon and syria , fury over the images continued to spread , with protests held across afghanistan as well as in egypt , indian-held kashmir , indonesia , iran , lebanon , the palestinian territories and thailand . afghan protester killed one afghan was killed and five others wounded early tuesday when protesters attacked the offices of norwegian nato troops in western afghanistan .
demonstrators threw hand grenades at the offices of a norwegian reconstruction team in the city of maymana , deputy governor sayed ahmad sayed said . protests also raged in algeria and nigeria , and a danish aid group was forced to halt activities in the stricken darfur region of sudan . syria rejected denmark 's accusations it had not done enough to protect its embassy in damascus , a minister saying that police had tried to shield it with their " bodies and blood . " denmark has been the chief target of muslim fury as it was a danish newspaper that first printed the 12 caricatures of mohammed , last september .
since then they have appeared in newspapers in many western countries , though not those of britain and the us . iran calls for ' holocaust cartoons ' in the violence in tehran , after first smashing and torching the facade of the embassy of austria -lrb- currently european union president -rrb- , a group of some 400 student members of the islamic hard-line basij militia moved on to denmark 's diplomatic compound and attempted a full-scale assault . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kuwait , danish products are already off many shelves iranian commerce minister masoud mir-kazemi announced a total ban on danish imports as well as any other business dealings with the country " until further notice . " meanwhile , iran 's largest selling newspaper announced it would hold a contest for cartoons of the holocaust . " the western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression , so let 's see if they mean what they say and also print these holocaust cartoons , " the graphics editor at the hamshahri newspaper , farid mortazavi , told afp . denmark warns nationals in indonesia on tuesday , denmark warned its nationals in indonesia to leave the country amid fears that protests there could turn violent .
indonesia is the world 's most populous muslim nation . the advisory came as protests appeared to taper off in indonesia , with about 50 protestors from ahlul bait , an islamic cultural center , holding a brief rally outside the embassy in jakarta . malaysia 's moderate stance reflecting the moderate style of islam practiced in malaysia , that country 's prime minister , abdullah ahmad badawi - who had earlier condemned the controversial images - spoke out against a boycott of danish products .
he also criticized a local newspaper in eastern sarawak state that reprinted the cartoons over the weekend as " insensitive and irresponsible . " " i am surprised ...
they did n't think things through .
they have been irresponsible as they know this kind of action can lead to ill-feelings , " he was quoted as saying by the official bernama news agency . west calls for calm elsewhere in the world , charge and countercharge continued with many european governments condemning the violence and expressing sympathy with denmark .

here 's a look at the differing laws in european countries . in bangladesh , minister for industry matiur rahman nizami was quoted in the press as telling the european union that if christianity and jesus christ were protected by blasphemy laws , then there was no justification for those laws not being used to protect the rights of muslims . in lebanon .
sheikh hassan nasrallah , the head of the radical hezbollah movement , on friday called on european parliaments to pass laws " prohibiting the media from attacking god and the prophets .

now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence .

nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem .

but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .
that means importing less schlock from abroad and exporting good literature from germany in order to boost revenues . christine harjes -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2006 german translators take their case for better pay to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translating is hard work - and poorly paid , too they are the starvelings of literature : translators .
but now they are fighting back after a recent court case said translators should get a percentage of book sales .
the dispute has the publishing industry worried . " whoever says he can live off translating is either lying or doing an unprofessional job , " germany 's best-known literary translator , harry rowohlt , once quoted a former editor of the suhrkamp publishing house , walter boehlich . rowohlt should know : he 's translated works like " winnie the pooh , " frank mccourt 's bestselling autobiography " angel 's ashes , " kurt vonnegut 's " timequake " and over a hundred other , mostly american books .
despite the impressive resumé , rowohlt said he could not live off his translating . " it 's my main occupation , " he said .
" but if i did n't travel around giving book readings or playing a homeless person on -lrb- the tv show -rrb- lindenstrasse , i could n't afford to be a translator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translator harry rowohlt , in his other life as a down-on-his-luck character on tv burkhart kroeber , who translates italian author umberto eco , shared concrete figures on how much , or little , translators make .
they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .
in addition , he sometimes gets a share of the net sales price , but it is minimal and only applies after certain larger printing runs . his is no entry-level wage ; he has been in the business for 30 years . triple the wage gerlinde schermer-rauwolf of the association of german-language translators -lrb- vdü -rrb- , which is part of the ver.di trade union , is demanding a tripling of that wage .
it does n't have to happen overnight , she said .
but she wants a substantial increase in the foreseeable future . according to her , translators ' income should be based on three pillars .
first , the per-page rate should be increased .
second , a general royalty system for each copy of the translated work should be introduced and third , a system of subsidiary rights should be applied , from which the translator would benefit when the book appears in paperback form or as an audio-book . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : translators want a bigger share in books ' profits in 2002 , the federal government set down in an amended copyright law provisions to give fair remuneration to several different groups of artists , including translators . " fairness , " however , was never exactly defined , because at the time , the publishers promised to accommodate translators .
but that has yet to happen , according to kroeber . " publishing houses have not taken one step towards solving this problem since the new copyright law has taken effect , " he said .
" they 've refused everything . " go n e to court in order that their claims do not expire due to statues of limitation , several translators have gone to court .
in a few of the twelve cases brought to judges , the first decisions have been handed down . judges approved the current annual per-page rate of 18 euros , but regarding net royalties , the court gave translators an additional two percent and a full 25 percent regarding proceeds from subsidiary rights . the decisions are a victory for translators , but they do not sit well with publishers . fewer tra n slatio n s as a result ? " the reaction is that publishers are refraining from translating , " said christian sprang , legal counsel at the german book trade association .
" we 've seen that since the copyright law went into effect in 2002 , the number of translated titles have gone down from 9,000 to 5,500 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be fewer translated books in the stacks if translators get paid more ?
sprang sees the conflict around translators ' fees in market terms .
no translator is forced to do a translation if the per-page rate is too low for his or her taste , he said .
on the other hand , outrageously high fees for well-known authors are appropriate , he said . " there is only one dan brown , one john grisham and one joanne rowling in this world , " he said .
" but just in germany there are several thousand translators who can translate these works .
supply and demand determine the price . " if harry rowohlt had his way , publishers would release more high-quality literature .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .

asian muslims also spoke out as tensions simmered there . hundreds of demonstrators attacked two european embassies in iran and the regime halted trade with denmark , amid continued protests over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . governments and international bodies , including those of some islamic asian nations , called for calm and compromise .
and from brussels to tokyo to moscow to washington , non-muslim leaders sought an elusive balance between mollifying muslims outraged by irreverent caricatures of islam 's prophet , and upholding the principles of free speech . in the public arena , however , passions remained dangerously inflamed , with worldwide demonstrations against the cartoons causing at least five deaths and dozens of injuries and arrests . white house condemns ' hate speech ' the white house said it understood islamic anger but added that muslims must also condemn anti-semitic and anti-christian " hate speech . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian demonstrators torched the danish embassy in damascus " we understand fully why people , why muslims , find the cartoons offensive , " spokesman scott mcclellan said , while upholding " the right of people to express their views , and freedom of speech in society . " after a weekend that saw denmark 's embassies torched in lebanon and syria , fury over the images continued to spread , with protests held across afghanistan as well as in egypt , indian-held kashmir , indonesia , iran , lebanon , the palestinian territories and thailand . afghan protester killed one afghan was killed and five others wounded early tuesday when protesters attacked the offices of norwegian nato troops in western afghanistan .
demonstrators threw hand grenades at the offices of a norwegian reconstruction team in the city of maymana , deputy governor sayed ahmad sayed said . protests also raged in algeria and nigeria , and a danish aid group was forced to halt activities in the stricken darfur region of sudan . syria rejected denmark 's accusations it had not done enough to protect its embassy in damascus , a minister saying that police had tried to shield it with their " bodies and blood . " denmark has been the chief target of muslim fury as it was a danish newspaper that first printed the 12 caricatures of mohammed , last september .
since then they have appeared in newspapers in many western countries , though not those of britain and the us . iran calls for ' holocaust cartoons ' in the violence in tehran , after first smashing and torching the facade of the embassy of austria -lrb- currently european union president -rrb- , a group of some 400 student members of the islamic hard-line basij militia moved on to denmark 's diplomatic compound and attempted a full-scale assault . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kuwait , danish products are already off many shelves iranian commerce minister masoud mir-kazemi announced a total ban on danish imports as well as any other business dealings with the country " until further notice . " meanwhile , iran 's largest selling newspaper announced it would hold a contest for cartoons of the holocaust . " the western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression , so let 's see if they mean what they say and also print these holocaust cartoons , " the graphics editor at the hamshahri newspaper , farid mortazavi , told afp . denmark warns nationals in indonesia on tuesday , denmark warned its nationals in indonesia to leave the country amid fears that protests there could turn violent .
indonesia is the world 's most populous muslim nation . the advisory came as protests appeared to taper off in indonesia , with about 50 protestors from ahlul bait , an islamic cultural center , holding a brief rally outside the embassy in jakarta . malaysia 's moderate stance reflecting the moderate style of islam practiced in malaysia , that country 's prime minister , abdullah ahmad badawi - who had earlier condemned the controversial images - spoke out against a boycott of danish products .

they did n't think things through .
they have been irresponsible as they know this kind of action can lead to ill-feelings , " he was quoted as saying by the official bernama news agency . west calls for calm elsewhere in the world , charge and countercharge continued with many european governments condemning the violence and expressing sympathy with denmark .
voices on both sides urged calm . the european council of religious leaders , which groups representatives of all europe 's religions , condemned both the publication of the cartoon and the ensuing violence in the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslim protestors rallied in front of the danish embassy monday in brussels , the european commission denounced the latest wave of violence and called for calm on all sides .

the russian government condemned the arab attacks on diplomatic missions but voiced sympathy for muslims offended by the controversial cartoons . in new zealand , prime minister helen clark criticized the decision by several media outlets to publish the cartoons , saying it has put the country 's people at risk . three new zealand newspapers and two television channels have reproduced the cartoons .
clark said the country 's newspapers had the right to publish what they wanted , but called their decision to reproduce the caricatures " ill-judged " and " gratuitous .

asian muslims also spoke out as tensions simmered there . hundreds of demonstrators attacked two european embassies in iran and the regime halted trade with denmark , amid continued protests over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . governments and international bodies , including those of some islamic asian nations , called for calm and compromise .
and from brussels to tokyo to moscow to washington , non-muslim leaders sought an elusive balance between mollifying muslims outraged by irreverent caricatures of islam 's prophet , and upholding the principles of free speech . in the public arena , however , passions remained dangerously inflamed , with worldwide demonstrations against the cartoons causing at least five deaths and dozens of injuries and arrests . white house condemns ' hate speech ' the white house said it understood islamic anger but added that muslims must also condemn anti-semitic and anti-christian " hate speech . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian demonstrators torched the danish embassy in damascus " we understand fully why people , why muslims , find the cartoons offensive , " spokesman scott mcclellan said , while upholding " the right of people to express their views , and freedom of speech in society . " after a weekend that saw denmark 's embassies torched in lebanon and syria , fury over the images continued to spread , with protests held across afghanistan as well as in egypt , indian-held kashmir , indonesia , iran , lebanon , the palestinian territories and thailand . afghan protester killed one afghan was killed and five others wounded early tuesday when protesters attacked the offices of norwegian nato troops in western afghanistan .
demonstrators threw hand grenades at the offices of a norwegian reconstruction team in the city of maymana , deputy governor sayed ahmad sayed said . protests also raged in algeria and nigeria , and a danish aid group was forced to halt activities in the stricken darfur region of sudan . syria rejected denmark 's accusations it had not done enough to protect its embassy in damascus , a minister saying that police had tried to shield it with their " bodies and blood . " denmark has been the chief target of muslim fury as it was a danish newspaper that first printed the 12 caricatures of mohammed , last september .
since then they have appeared in newspapers in many western countries , though not those of britain and the us . iran calls for ' holocaust cartoons ' in the violence in tehran , after first smashing and torching the facade of the embassy of austria -lrb- currently european union president -rrb- , a group of some 400 student members of the islamic hard-line basij militia moved on to denmark 's diplomatic compound and attempted a full-scale assault . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kuwait , danish products are already off many shelves iranian commerce minister masoud mir-kazemi announced a total ban on danish imports as well as any other business dealings with the country " until further notice . " meanwhile , iran 's largest selling newspaper announced it would hold a contest for cartoons of the holocaust . " the western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression , so let 's see if they mean what they say and also print these holocaust cartoons , " the graphics editor at the hamshahri newspaper , farid mortazavi , told afp . denmark warns nationals in indonesia on tuesday , denmark warned its nationals in indonesia to leave the country amid fears that protests there could turn violent .
indonesia is the world 's most populous muslim nation . the advisory came as protests appeared to taper off in indonesia , with about 50 protestors from ahlul bait , an islamic cultural center , holding a brief rally outside the embassy in jakarta . malaysia 's moderate stance reflecting the moderate style of islam practiced in malaysia , that country 's prime minister , abdullah ahmad badawi - who had earlier condemned the controversial images - spoke out against a boycott of danish products .
he also criticized a local newspaper in eastern sarawak state that reprinted the cartoons over the weekend as " insensitive and irresponsible . " " i am surprised ...
they did n't think things through .
they have been irresponsible as they know this kind of action can lead to ill-feelings , " he was quoted as saying by the official bernama news agency . west calls for calm elsewhere in the world , charge and countercharge continued with many european governments condemning the violence and expressing sympathy with denmark .
voices on both sides urged calm . the european council of religious leaders , which groups representatives of all europe 's religions , condemned both the publication of the cartoon and the ensuing violence in the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslim protestors rallied in front of the danish embassy monday in brussels , the european commission denounced the latest wave of violence and called for calm on all sides .
the head of the vatican body responsible for inter-faith relations called for restraint among christians and muslims . row spreads to russia , new zealand russia , which had been largely untouched by the cartoons controversy until now , was drawing into the fray when leading chechen politician ramyan kadyrov announced a ban on danish aid organizations in chechnya .
the russian government condemned the arab attacks on diplomatic missions but voiced sympathy for muslims offended by the controversial cartoons . in new zealand , prime minister helen clark criticized the decision by several media outlets to publish the cartoons , saying it has put the country 's people at risk . three new zealand newspapers and two television channels have reproduced the cartoons .
clark said the country 's newspapers had the right to publish what they wanted , but called their decision to reproduce the caricatures " ill-judged " and " gratuitous . " danish newspaper jyllands-posten , which first published the cartoons , is talking to danish muslim representatives about a joint declaration , the ritzau news agency reported , to help calm worldwide tensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict germany intends to reach out to the arab world to defuse the violent unrest over the publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammed , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday .

the dispute has the publishing industry worried .

they are paid between 14 and 22 euros -lrb- $ 16.8 to $ 26.5 -rrb- per page .
kroeber himself manages no more than 100 pages per month , which brings him between 1,400 and 2,200 euros gross .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .

it has failed to pass one , however - the proposal got hung up in debate over implementation details . the parties involved could n't agree how far beyond basic eu requirements the law should go .
the current government may soon face sanctions from the european court of justice . but when people debate the antidiscrimination law , they are mainly talking about discrimination on the basis of race , religion or disability , not gender , said ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies . basic german law does , already , provide for gender equality . " it is clear on a legal level that sex discrimination is not permissible , " she said .
" the problem is on a cultural level . " for one thing , structures that could be helpful in supporting equality are often weak . " we do n't have class action lawsuits -lrb- in germany , -rrb- that may make a difference .
we do n't have a federal commission that supports people -lrb- like the equal employment opportunity commission in the us , or the uk 's equal opportunities commission . -rrb-
it may happen , but not yet . " volu n tary cha n ge if there is no threat of a lawsuit to scare german firms into good behavior , what will ? a look across the channel at britain could , possibly , shed light on the future of gender discrimination suits in continental europe .
britain lifted the cap on awards in discrimination claims in 1993 , sparking a leap in litigation .
that grew greater still after the burden of proof in a discrimination case was shifted to the employer in 2001 . when germany does eventually pass an antidiscrimination law , it could affect the litigation landscape .
at present , however , german firms seem content to put gender-equality measures into effect to the extent that they are useful to the bottom line and company morale .
pressure seems mostly to come in the form of campaigns to improve the lot of women in the workplace , not fear of punishment . since 1996 , the association total equality has given out annual awards to companies and organizations that show a long-term commitment to equal opportunity in their personnel policy .
so far , it has given its seal of approval to more than 100 institutions . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the detail of discrimination whilst germany is still locked in debate over the introduction of a new anti-discrimination law , other countries have already stitched eu guidelines on discriminatory practices into the fabric of their judicial systems .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier has had little news to report on the crisis " germany as a whole is deeply concerned , including of course the government , " he said .
" we 've been trying to establish contact with the kidnappers for many days , but our efforts have failed so far .
that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

asian muslims also spoke out as tensions simmered there . hundreds of demonstrators attacked two european embassies in iran and the regime halted trade with denmark , amid continued protests over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . governments and international bodies , including those of some islamic asian nations , called for calm and compromise .
and from brussels to tokyo to moscow to washington , non-muslim leaders sought an elusive balance between mollifying muslims outraged by irreverent caricatures of islam 's prophet , and upholding the principles of free speech . in the public arena , however , passions remained dangerously inflamed , with worldwide demonstrations against the cartoons causing at least five deaths and dozens of injuries and arrests . white house condemns ' hate speech ' the white house said it understood islamic anger but added that muslims must also condemn anti-semitic and anti-christian " hate speech . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian demonstrators torched the danish embassy in damascus " we understand fully why people , why muslims , find the cartoons offensive , " spokesman scott mcclellan said , while upholding " the right of people to express their views , and freedom of speech in society . " after a weekend that saw denmark 's embassies torched in lebanon and syria , fury over the images continued to spread , with protests held across afghanistan as well as in egypt , indian-held kashmir , indonesia , iran , lebanon , the palestinian territories and thailand . afghan protester killed one afghan was killed and five others wounded early tuesday when protesters attacked the offices of norwegian nato troops in western afghanistan .
demonstrators threw hand grenades at the offices of a norwegian reconstruction team in the city of maymana , deputy governor sayed ahmad sayed said . protests also raged in algeria and nigeria , and a danish aid group was forced to halt activities in the stricken darfur region of sudan . syria rejected denmark 's accusations it had not done enough to protect its embassy in damascus , a minister saying that police had tried to shield it with their " bodies and blood . " denmark has been the chief target of muslim fury as it was a danish newspaper that first printed the 12 caricatures of mohammed , last september .
since then they have appeared in newspapers in many western countries , though not those of britain and the us . iran calls for ' holocaust cartoons ' in the violence in tehran , after first smashing and torching the facade of the embassy of austria -lrb- currently european union president -rrb- , a group of some 400 student members of the islamic hard-line basij militia moved on to denmark 's diplomatic compound and attempted a full-scale assault . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kuwait , danish products are already off many shelves iranian commerce minister masoud mir-kazemi announced a total ban on danish imports as well as any other business dealings with the country " until further notice . " meanwhile , iran 's largest selling newspaper announced it would hold a contest for cartoons of the holocaust . " the western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression , so let 's see if they mean what they say and also print these holocaust cartoons , " the graphics editor at the hamshahri newspaper , farid mortazavi , told afp . denmark warns nationals in indonesia on tuesday , denmark warned its nationals in indonesia to leave the country amid fears that protests there could turn violent .
indonesia is the world 's most populous muslim nation . the advisory came as protests appeared to taper off in indonesia , with about 50 protestors from ahlul bait , an islamic cultural center , holding a brief rally outside the embassy in jakarta . malaysia 's moderate stance reflecting the moderate style of islam practiced in malaysia , that country 's prime minister , abdullah ahmad badawi - who had earlier condemned the controversial images - spoke out against a boycott of danish products .
he also criticized a local newspaper in eastern sarawak state that reprinted the cartoons over the weekend as " insensitive and irresponsible . " " i am surprised ...
they did n't think things through .
they have been irresponsible as they know this kind of action can lead to ill-feelings , " he was quoted as saying by the official bernama news agency . west calls for calm elsewhere in the world , charge and countercharge continued with many european governments condemning the violence and expressing sympathy with denmark .
voices on both sides urged calm . the european council of religious leaders , which groups representatives of all europe 's religions , condemned both the publication of the cartoon and the ensuing violence in the muslim world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian muslim protestors rallied in front of the danish embassy monday in brussels , the european commission denounced the latest wave of violence and called for calm on all sides .
the head of the vatican body responsible for inter-faith relations called for restraint among christians and muslims . row spreads to russia , new zealand russia , which had been largely untouched by the cartoons controversy until now , was drawing into the fray when leading chechen politician ramyan kadyrov announced a ban on danish aid organizations in chechnya .
the russian government condemned the arab attacks on diplomatic missions but voiced sympathy for muslims offended by the controversial cartoons . in new zealand , prime minister helen clark criticized the decision by several media outlets to publish the cartoons , saying it has put the country 's people at risk . three new zealand newspapers and two television channels have reproduced the cartoons .
clark said the country 's newspapers had the right to publish what they wanted , but called their decision to reproduce the caricatures " ill-judged " and " gratuitous . " danish newspaper jyllands-posten , which first published the cartoons , is talking to danish muslim representatives about a joint declaration , the ritzau news agency reported , to help calm worldwide tensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict germany intends to reach out to the arab world to defuse the violent unrest over the publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammed , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday .

asian muslims also spoke out as tensions simmered there . hundreds of demonstrators attacked two european embassies in iran and the regime halted trade with denmark , amid continued protests over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed . governments and international bodies , including those of some islamic asian nations , called for calm and compromise .
and from brussels to tokyo to moscow to washington , non-muslim leaders sought an elusive balance between mollifying muslims outraged by irreverent caricatures of islam 's prophet , and upholding the principles of free speech . in the public arena , however , passions remained dangerously inflamed , with worldwide demonstrations against the cartoons causing at least five deaths and dozens of injuries and arrests . white house condemns ' hate speech ' the white house said it understood islamic anger but added that muslims must also condemn anti-semitic and anti-christian " hate speech . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian demonstrators torched the danish embassy in damascus " we understand fully why people , why muslims , find the cartoons offensive , " spokesman scott mcclellan said , while upholding " the right of people to express their views , and freedom of speech in society . " after a weekend that saw denmark 's embassies torched in lebanon and syria , fury over the images continued to spread , with protests held across afghanistan as well as in egypt , indian-held kashmir , indonesia , iran , lebanon , the palestinian territories and thailand . afghan protester killed one afghan was killed and five others wounded early tuesday when protesters attacked the offices of norwegian nato troops in western afghanistan .
demonstrators threw hand grenades at the offices of a norwegian reconstruction team in the city of maymana , deputy governor sayed ahmad sayed said . protests also raged in algeria and nigeria , and a danish aid group was forced to halt activities in the stricken darfur region of sudan . syria rejected denmark 's accusations it had not done enough to protect its embassy in damascus , a minister saying that police had tried to shield it with their " bodies and blood . " denmark has been the chief target of muslim fury as it was a danish newspaper that first printed the 12 caricatures of mohammed , last september .
since then they have appeared in newspapers in many western countries , though not those of britain and the us . iran calls for ' holocaust cartoons ' in the violence in tehran , after first smashing and torching the facade of the embassy of austria -lrb- currently european union president -rrb- , a group of some 400 student members of the islamic hard-line basij militia moved on to denmark 's diplomatic compound and attempted a full-scale assault . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in kuwait , danish products are already off many shelves iranian commerce minister masoud mir-kazemi announced a total ban on danish imports as well as any other business dealings with the country " until further notice .

" the western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression , so let 's see if they mean what they say and also print these holocaust cartoons , " the graphics editor at the hamshahri newspaper , farid mortazavi , told afp . denmark warns nationals in indonesia on tuesday , denmark warned its nationals in indonesia to leave the country amid fears that protests there could turn violent .

but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen .

but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen . " you have to ask yourself what kind of statement you 're making once the satirical elements have been stripped away , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark osama al-habahbeh has been in the thick of the controversy over the cartoons published in danish newspaper " jyllands-posten " that have enraged muslims worldwide - both as a reporter and as a danish muslim .

berlin is still trying to establish contact with the kidnappers . government sources in berlin said on monday that a special crisis team is continuing efforts to establish contact with the kidnappers who 've been holding the two german engineers captive since jan .
24 . in a videotape broadcast last week by qatar 's al-jazeera television network the hostage takers said they were from a group calling itself " followers of unity and prophetic tradition " and made demands towards the german government , including closing the german embassy in baghdad , ending all collaboration with the new iraqi government and withdrawing german companies operating in iraq . in the videotape , the kidnappers gave germany 72 hours to act on their demands . the two hostages , rene bräunlich , 31 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , work for a german gas equipment installation company and were snatched near the baiji oil refinery compound by armed men in military uniforms . as in the case of the abduction of german archeologist susanne osthoff about a month ago , chancellor angela merkel refused to give in to the demands underlining that germany would not be blackmailed .
but leading german politicians , including president horst köhler , have renewed their pleas for the release of the hostages . " i 'm gravely concerned about the fate of the two germans , " köhler said .
" we can only hope now that they will come back safely . " german muslims offer help germany 's largest islamic groups have joined in public appeals for the lives of the hostages .
the chairman of the islamic council in germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in a newspaper on monday that it was regrettable that religion was being abused once again and all of islam brought into disrepute .

" we may have possibilities that others do not have .
we are ready to help , " he said , adding that he was surprised that berlin had no been able to make progress in the case .

" we 've been trying to establish contact with the kidnappers for many days , but our efforts have failed so far .
that is why we can only appeal to the hostage-takers once again to release the hostages or at least get in contact with german authorities . " steinmeier also expressed fears that anti-european protests in the arab world over caricatures of the prophet mohammed , originally published in a danish newspaper , could worsen the situation of the hostages . in addition , experts say the kidnappers could belong to the al qaeda network of militant islamists , which would make it less likely that a ransom payment would secure the hostages ' release . susanne osthoff , who was kidnapped in iraq in november , was released 24 days later amid reports that a ransom had been paid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed .

a male nurse , nicknamed the " angel of death , " went on trial for murder over the deaths of 29 patients . twenty-seven-year old stephan letter went on trial tuesday over the deaths of 29 mostly elderly patients in what may have been the worst killing spree in postwar german history . the defendant - nicknamed the " angel of death " by the german press - admitted when he was arrested in july 2004 to killing 12 patients in his care by lethal injection at a clinic in the town of sonthofen , in the bavarian alps .

a male nurse , nicknamed the " angel of death , " went on trial for murder over the deaths of 29 patients . twenty-seven-year old stephan letter went on trial tuesday over the deaths of 29 mostly elderly patients in what may have been the worst killing spree in postwar german history . the defendant - nicknamed the " angel of death " by the german press - admitted when he was arrested in july 2004 to killing 12 patients in his care by lethal injection at a clinic in the town of sonthofen , in the bavarian alps . ' saving ' the dying he told police the killings had been acts of mercy to " save " dying people from their suffering .
investigators subsequently dug up 42 graves of people who died at the clinic in sonthofen for autopsies , in some cases against the fierce resistance of their loved ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cemetery workers exhumed bodies for evidence in the case the nurse was then charged with 16 counts of murder , 12 of manslaughter and one count of killing on demand .
if convicted , letter could face life in prison . the deaths began in february 2003 , less than a month after the nurse started working there , and all the patients died during letter 's 17 months at the sonthofen clinic .
the majority were 75 years of age or older , though the youngest was only 40 . the deaths of the patients raised no suspicion at the time , but the police were called in because medication had disappeared from the clinic .
stephan l. was finally arrested when they found medicine at his home which the state prosecutor in the southern city of kempten , where the trial is taking place , said was enough to kill 10 people . ' indiscriminate , aimless ' acts the prosecution said that stephan l. had maliciously ended the lives even of patients who were recovering and in some cases stole their belongings . " he acted relatively indiscriminately and aimlessly , " said wilhelm seitz , a lawyer who is representing relatives of 11 of the dead as co-plaintiffs in the case , speaking to the associated press news service . " not all of the patients were seriously ill , and he had had no contact at all with some of them .

statistics say he will sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .
six women are suing a us unit of dresdner bank for $ 1.4 billion . in january , a group of six female executives filed a gender-discrimination suit against the us subsidiary of a german investment bank , dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- drkw -rrb- .
the high-powered women claim they were " systematically " turned down for promotions , got less pay for doing the same work as their male counterparts , and were denied access to key deals - in short , they were unable to break through a " glass ceiling " at their workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head office of drkw germany , in frankfurt the women are asking for $ 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.16 billion -rrb- in damages in the class-action suit , reflecting the high-paying nature of investment banking .
but while gender-discrimination lawsuits may be commonplace in the us , and are a rapidly growing phenomenon in britain , in germany they are rare .
this is the case despite statistics showing working women in germany get as raw a deal as they do elsewhere - maybe even worse . yet it is unlikely german employers will be faced with a slew of high-priced antidiscrimination suits any time soon .
according to ute sacksofsky , a legal scholar at the university of frankfurt who specializes in constitutional law and gender studies , there are a number of reasons for this . discrimi n atio n n ot a n outrage first , compensation damages paid out in germany tend to be much lower than in the united states , so there is less financial motivation to bring a law suit , sacksofsky said .
secondly , germany does n't have a jury system , where jurors decide the amount of damages that get paid out .
rather , damages are awarded based on an existing civil code and a judge decides the amount to be paid . " the law says payment has to be ' commensurate ' with the damage done and this is almost always much lower in germany than in the united states , " sacksofsky said . that goes for all kinds of tort cases , not just discrimination , she added . a less tangible , but perhaps equally powerful , factor is that " sex discrimination culturally is still not generally viewed as something outrageous , " sacksofsky said .
" many people have the feeling that it is the absolute right of the employer to choose who they want to promote , that they should have that autonomy .
it goes back to our concept of vertragsfreiheit , or contractual freedom . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plaintiffs say maternity leave was an issue a final reason may be that , with so little support for sex-discrimination suits , " people might feel such an action would terminate their chances on the job market , " she added . in addition to complaints about unequal pay and lack of promotion , the drkw suit includes descriptions of sexual advances , belittling comments about maternity leave , and the plaintiffs ' claim that meetings would sometimes end with a visit to a strip club , effectively preventing the women from taking part .
the company has said many of the claims were irrelevant to a sex-discrimination case , and were simply stated to damage the image of the firm . statistics back up ' leaky pipeli n e ' whether or not such anecdotes are true , it is not hard to come by statistics that support the existence of a glass ceiling .
there is an average pay gap of 16 percent between men and women across the eu , according to statistics agency eurostat .
and a 2004 study done for stern magazine showed an average gender-pay gap of 24 percent in germany - worse than in any other european country . meanwhile , the well-known " leaky pipeline " effect - where large percentages of women start out at the lower echelons of a business , but somehow drip out of sight before making it to the top - is evident throughout business in germany and europe , as well as the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are starting to break through in politics in drkw 's capital-markets division , women hold 60 percent of all administrative jobs , but they make up only 20 percent of vice presidents , 13 percent of directors , and 2 percent of managing directors , lawyers on the case told ma n ager magazin . model compa n ies beate winterer of the organization total equality said there is no question that there is a glass ceiling in germany .
" look at the number of women in leading positions in german companies , " she said .
but , she noted , " germans are not as likely to take things to court . " according to winterer , total equality was created as a means of rewarding those companies that do give women a better chance .
in deciding who to present with a certificate , the group looks at things like whether a company offers mentoring programs for women , flexible work hours , and what the company does to help women manage work and family . according to winterer , companies do not implement such measures to be nice , but because it helps them compete in the long run . " they recognize that there are highly qualified women , and they have to give them a chance to get to the top , " she said .

but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands . burning european embassies , incensed mobs , boycotts of western goods and a tight security ring around journalists fearing for their lives - the events of the past week are certainly not what danish paper jyllands-posten envisaged when it printed 12 cartoons satirizing the prophet mohammed last september .
now european newsrooms are grappling with the issue of press freedom and how far they can go in its name . " it 's the burning question of the day , " said robert shaw , information and human rights officer at the brussels-based european federation of journalists .
" the media needs to openly discuss the effects of the affair and also key things , like the importance of not compromising on editorial independence . " yet the matter appears to be more than an open-and-shut case about press freedom . as violent protests by muslims spark disbelief in europe and politicians agonize over a " clash of cultures and values , " others point out that it 's not the first time europe has faced a " blasphemy " controversy .
nothing new " these things have an old tradition .
it 's really not a new story , " said götz von olenhusen , a freiburg-based expert on media law . von olenhusen pointed to one of the most famous cases , in the 1920s , involving three graphics by famous german artist george grosz . one of them showed jesus on the cross with a gas mask and army boots and the slogan " hold your tongue and continue serving . "
the trial lasted three years and grosz appealed twice until he was finally acquitted . the media law expert pointed out that even in recent years , the authors of satirical works on christianity and the church have ended up in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is how we 'll become european champion , " says one titanic cover about soccer the german satirical magazine titanic has been dragged to court eight times in 15 years by church groups - four times for denigrating the pope , thrice for ridiculing religion and once because a bishop felt personally insulted .
however , none of the suits ended in favor of the church groups . anti-blasphemy law largely used by christians but german regional courts have successfully used an anti-blasphemy law dating back to 1871 in a few less prominent cases . one involved a drawing of jesus on the cross in the form of a mouse trap and another of the crucified jesus with the words " masochism is curable . "
a musical play by the cabaret group " 3 tornados " which ridiculed the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception by portraying crucified pigs was also banned . the anti-blasphemy law says that anyone who publicly or through written works " insults the religious beliefs of another in such a way that it disturbs public peace " can be fined or face a prison sentence of up to three years . though the law is not confined to the christian religion , experts point out that it 's been largely christians who have invoked it . germany " very liberal " on artistic freedom at the same time experts stress that , in germany , cases of blasphemy are largely played out in public debate rather than ending up in court . on a european level , germany also has very liberal laws when it comes to freedom of expression and art , von olenhusen added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haderer was sentenced in greece to jail time for " the life of jesus " austrian caricaturist michael haderer , for instance , was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison in greece for his comic book " the life of jesus . "
the work showed jesus as a marijuana-smoking hippie .
in austria too , the tough anti-blasphemy law prohibits ridiculing religion and punishes the offense with six-month jail terms . experts also remain certain that the controversy over the mohammed caricatures could n't be deemed blasphemous in germany . michael schmuck , a media law expert in berlin , pointed out that instances of blasphemy found in satirical works are covered by the german constitution 's article on artistic freedom and are practically unassailable in most cases . " when it comes to artistic freedom , the courts usually admit only a personal injury towards a living religious person , such as the pope , and not just generally insulting a religion , as is the case in the mohammed caricatures , since the prophet is n't a living person , " schmuck explained . " also the person who created the works must deliberately intend to disrupt the public peace , " schmuck said .
" that can hardly be said of the danish caricaturists who were merely trying to draw attention to a social problem . " denmark itself , where the mohammed drawings were first published , has a law providing for fines and up to four months in jail for anyone who " publicly offends or insults a religion that is recognized in the country . " however , a court case brought against jyllands-posten by 11 muslim groups last october was thrown out ; the judges said freedom of expression was more important than the ban on blasphemy . " a question of good taste " in light of the controversy over the mohammed cartoons , experts agree that the only question for the media is one of ethics and sticking voluntarily to self-imposed press codes . " at the end of the day , it 's a question of good taste whether to publish such caricatures or not , " said von olenhusen . " you have to ask yourself what kind of statement you 're making once the satirical elements have been stripped away , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark osama al-habahbeh has been in the thick of the controversy over the cartoons published in danish newspaper " jyllands-posten " that have enraged muslims worldwide - both as a reporter and as a danish muslim .

" it 's as close to the garden of eden as you 're going to find on earth , " said bruce beehler , co-leader of the group .
the team recorded new butterflies , frogs , and a series of remarkable plants that included five new palms and a giant rhododendron flower .
the survey also found a honeyeater bird that was previously unknown to science . "
it 's beautiful , untouched , unpopulated forest ; there 's no evidence of human impact or presence " dr bruce beehler , conservation international the research group - from the us , indonesia and australia - trekked through an area in the mist-shrouded foja mountains , located just north of the vast mamberamo basin of north-western -lrb- indonesian -rrb- new guinea .
the researchers spent nearly a month in the locality , detailing the wildlife and plant life from the lower hills to near the summit of the foja range , which reaches more than 2,000m in elevation .
" it 's beautiful , untouched , unpopulated forest ; there 's no evidence of human impact or presence up in these mountains , " dr beehler told the bbc news website .
" we were dropped in by helicopter .
there 's not a trail anywhere ; it was really hard to get around . "
he said that even two local indigenous groups , the kwerba and papasena people , customary landowners of the forest who accompanied the scientists , were astonished at the area 's isolation .
" the men from the local villages came with us and they made it clear that no one they knew had been anywhere near this area - not even their ancestors , " mr beehler said .
unafraid of humans one of the team 's most remarkable discoveries was a honeyeater bird with a bright orange patch on its face - the first new bird species to be sighted on the island of new guinea in more than 60 years .
the researchers also solved a major ornithological mystery - the location of the homeland of berlepsch 's six-wired bird of paradise .
first described in the late 19th century through specimens collected by indigenous hunters from an unknown location on new guinea , the species had been the focus of several subsequent expeditions that failed to find it .
on only the second day of the team 's expedition , the amazed scientists watched as a male berlepsch 's bird of paradise performed a mating dance for an attending female in the field camp .
it was the first time a live male of the species had been observed by western scientists , and proved that the foja mountains was the species ' true home .
" this bird had been filed away and forgotten ; it had been lost .
to rediscover it was , for me , in some ways , more exciting than finding the honeyeater .
i spent 20 years working on birds of paradise ; they 're pretty darn sexy beasts , " dr beehler enthused .
the team also recorded a golden-mantled tree kangaroo , which was previously thought to have been hunted to near-extinction .
mr beehler said some of the creatures the team came into contact with were remarkably unafraid of humans .
two long-beaked echidnas , primitive egg-laying mammals , even allowed scientists to pick them up and bring them back to their camp to be studied , he added .
the december 2005 expedition was organised by the us-based organisation conservation international , together with the indonesian institute of sciences .
the team says it did not have nearly enough time during its expedition to survey the area completely and intends to return later in the year .
the locality lies within a protected zone and dr beehler believes its future is secure in the short term .
" the key investment is the local communities .
their knowledge , appreciation and oral traditions are so important .
they are the forest stewards who will look after these assets , " dr beehler told the bbc .

" it 's as close to the garden of eden as you 're going to find on earth , " said bruce beehler , co-leader of the group .
the team recorded new butterflies , frogs , and a series of remarkable plants that included five new palms and a giant rhododendron flower .
the survey also found a honeyeater bird that was previously unknown to science .
it 's beautiful , untouched , unpopulated forest ; there 's no evidence of human impact or presence dr bruce beehler , conservation international the research group - from the us , indonesia and australia - trekked through an area in the mist-shrouded foja mountains , located just north of the vast mamberamo basin of north-western -lrb- indonesian -rrb- new guinea .
the researchers spent nearly a month in the locality , detailing the wildlife and plant life from the lower hills to near the summit of the foja range , which reaches more than 2,000m in elevation .
" it 's beautiful , untouched , unpopulated forest ; there 's no evidence of human impact or presence up in these mountains , " dr beehler told the bbc news website .
foja mountains survey see more of the plants and animals found by the team in pictures " we were dropped in by helicopter .
there 's not a trail anywhere ; it was really hard to get around . "
he said that even two local indigenous groups , the kwerba and papasena people , customary landowners of the forest who accompanied the scientists , were astonished at the area 's isolation .
" the men from the local villages came with us and they made it clear that no one they knew had been anywhere near this area - not even their ancestors , " mr beehler said .
unafraid of humans one of the team 's most remarkable discoveries was a honeyeater bird with a bright orange patch on its face - the first new bird species to be sighted on the island of new guinea in more than 60 years .
the researchers also solved a major ornithological mystery - the location of the homeland of berlepsch 's six-wired bird of paradise .
first described in the late 19th century through specimens collected by indigenous hunters from an unknown location on new guinea , the species had been the focus of several subsequent expeditions that failed to find it .
on only the second day of the team 's expedition , the amazed scientists watched as a male berlepsch 's bird of paradise performed a mating dance for an attending female in the field camp .
it was the first time a live male of the species had been observed by western scientists , and proved that the foja mountains was the species ' true home .
" this bird had been filed away and forgotten ; it had been lost .
to rediscover it was , for me , in some ways , more exciting than finding the honeyeater .
i spent 20 years working on birds of paradise ; they 're pretty darn sexy beasts , " dr beehler enthused .
the team also recorded a golden-mantled tree kangaroo , which was previously thought to have been hunted to near-extinction .
the area seems to be very important for its frogs enlarge image mr beehler said some of the creatures the team came into contact with were remarkably unafraid of humans .
two long-beaked echidnas , primitive egg-laying mammals , even allowed scientists to pick them up and bring them back to their camp to be studied , he added .
the december 2005 expedition was organised by the us-based organisation conservation international , together with the indonesian institute of sciences .
the team says it did not have nearly enough time during its expedition to survey the area completely and intends to return later in the year .
the locality lies within a protected zone and dr beehler believes its future is secure in the short term .
" the key investment is the local communities .
their knowledge , appreciation and oral traditions are so important .
they are the forest stewards who will look after these assets , " dr beehler told the bbc .

two men were jailed in december for being part of a gang who " bought " a lithuanian woman in london and forced her to work as a prostitute in cardiff .
police said afterwards that they were examining more cases where women had been forced into the sex industry .
bbc wales ' week in week out programme has uncovered further examples of foreign women forced into prostitution .
the programme talks to one eastern european woman who describes how she came to the uk after being promised a job in a pub .
but after arriving in britain , she said she was " bought " for £ 4,500 , then beaten , raped and forced to sell herself for sex .
the woman , who has not been identified , told week in week out : " i was shocked when he beat me .
" they told me you are going to work but because i started shaking and was so scared they said leave her for three days to relax her because she is going to scare the customers . "
the woman ran away from the gang , but has continued to work as a prostitute in cardiff .
outreach workers who provide advice and medical help to prostitutes in the cardiff area said the extent of people trafficking to the city was beginning to emerge .
consultant clinical psychologist richard pates , who set up an outreach programme for prostitutes in cardiff said : " we think of the abolition of slavery more than 150 years ago , and yet this is what these women are ending up as being , they are ending up as being slaves . "
' hidden profession ' dr pates said that of more than 50 prostitutes his outreach colleagues saw every week , about 40 % were foreign and many admitted to being trafficked .
he said : " it 's very hard to quantify the numbers , because it is obviously a hidden trade , it 's a hidden profession .
" but if i asked our outreach worker to take you out today , she would have no trouble in introducing you to 20 women that would probably have been trafficked , so it is not difficult to find women if you know where you are looking .
" it is a real problem in this city and in wales . "
police working to combat sex trafficking told the programme that organised gangs were making " millions " of pounds from prostitution .
giles york , assistant chief constable of south wales police , said : " i have covert operations running , testing the stereotypical places to see if there is prostitution happening there , to see if there are people being exploited there .
" i also have post-prosecution cases running where we are taking away the assets from those organised criminals who have benefited from this criminality .
" and this is significant money , we are talking of money up to the millions that these people are able to bank and exploit when they have a whole network of brothels working to them . "
the week in week out investigation follows a court case in december last year where gjergj mungiovi-cuka , 19 , was found guilty of being part of a gang who paid £ 5,000 for a lithuanian woman and forced her to work as a prostitute in cardiff .
he was sentenced to four years ' custody at cardiff crown court , while his accomplice , akil likcani , received six years after admitting trafficking and controlling a prostitute .
a third gang member - known as benny - remains at large .
the woman , who was 20 at the time , had been forced to work in three cardiff brothels .
judge phillip richards told the two men : " both of you were involved in an evil trade which has been described as the 21st century 's slavery . "
week in week out is broadcast at 2235 gmt on bbc1 wales on tuesday and at 2130 gmt on bbc2w on wednesday .

police said afterwards that they were examining more cases where women had been forced into the sex industry .
bbc wales ' week in week out programme has uncovered further examples of foreign women forced into prostitution .
the programme talks to one eastern european woman who describes how she came to the uk after being promised a job in a pub .
but after arriving in britain , she said she was " bought " for £ 4,500 , then beaten , raped and forced to sell herself for sex .
giles york said prosecutions were under way the woman , who has not been identified , told week in week out : " i was shocked when he beat me .
" they told me you are going to work but because i started shaking and was so scared they said leave her for three days to relax her because she is going to scare the customers . "
the woman ran away from the gang , but has continued to work as a prostitute in cardiff .
outreach workers who provide advice and medical help to prostitutes in the cardiff area said the extent of people trafficking to the city was beginning to emerge .
consultant clinical psychologist richard pates , who set up an outreach programme for prostitutes in cardiff said : " we think of the abolition of slavery more than 150 years ago , and yet this is what these women are ending up as being , they are ending up as being slaves . "
' hidden profession ' dr pates said that of more than 50 prostitutes his outreach colleagues saw every week , about 40 % were foreign and many admitted to being trafficked .
gjergj mungiovi-cuka -lrb- left -rrb- and akil likcani were jailed last year he said : " it 's very hard to quantify the numbers , because it is obviously a hidden trade , it 's a hidden profession .
" but if i asked our outreach worker to take you out today , she would have no trouble in introducing you to 20 women that would probably have been trafficked , so it is not difficult to find women if you know where you are looking .
" it is a real problem in this city and in wales . "
police working to combat sex trafficking told the programme that organised gangs were making " millions " of pounds from prostitution .
giles york , assistant chief constable of south wales police , said : " i have covert operations running , testing the stereotypical places to see if there is prostitution happening there , to see if there are people being exploited there .
" i also have post-prosecution cases running where we are taking away the assets from those organised criminals who have benefited from this criminality .
richard pates said women were ending up as ' slaves ' " and this is significant money , we are talking of money up to the millions that these people are able to bank and exploit when they have a whole network of brothels working to them . "
the week in week out investigation follows a court case in december last year where gjergj mungiovi-cuka , 19 , was found guilty of being part of a gang who paid £ 5,000 for a lithuanian woman and forced her to work as a prostitute in cardiff .
he was sentenced to four years ' custody at cardiff crown court , while his accomplice , akil likcani , received six years after admitting trafficking and controlling a prostitute .
a third gang member - known as benny - remains at large .
the woman , who was 20 at the time , had been forced to work in three cardiff brothels .
judge phillip richards told the two men : " both of you were involved in an evil trade which has been described as the 21st century 's slavery . "
week in week out is broadcast at 2235 gmt on bbc1 wales on tuesday and at 2130 gmt on bbc2w on wednesday .

bp is a corporate giant , one of a handful of uk companies with truly global clout , and a barometer of the wider health of the oil industry .
surging world crude prices have helped boost the oil firm 's fortunes , and bp has just unveiled 2005 full-year profits of $ 19.31bn -lrb- £ 11.04bn -rrb- .
that marks a heady leap from the previous year 's profits of $ 16.2bn.
but 2005 has also been a bruising year for bp .
the company was forced to deal with the fallout of a fatal fire in march at its huge texas city refinery in the us , as well as disruption later in the year to its oil production in the wake of hurricane katrina .
russian venture bp 's full-year figures failed to top those of anglo-dutch rival shell , which last week reported annual profits of $ 22.94bn - a record for a uk-listed company .
what we want to see from bp is the evidence of what they are investing in in the medium to long term matthew lanstone , senior oil analyst , goldman sachs check bp 's shares but bp remains the bigger of europe 's two leading oil producers when measured by stock market value , and is currently worth $ 239bn to shell 's $ 222bn .
bp has scored some notable successes in recent years , including its move into the massive oil fields of russia through a lucrative 2003 joint venture with russian oil company tnk .
tnk-bp currently accounts for roughly a quarter of bp 's overall production of about 4 million barrels a day .
analysts at goldman sachs estimate that the uk firm has already recouped some $ 3.6bn from a total investment of less than $ 10bn .
growth in upstream production - the amount of oil bp actually extracts from the ground - is also expected to remain strong over the coming two to three years .
future oil despite setbacks along the us gulf coast - bp warned investors last month that the damage caused by the recent devastating hurricane season would cost it more than $ 1bn in 2005 - the company still expects to benefit from its presence in the gulf of mexico .
lord browne has worked to boost bp 's presence in russia bp 's giant thunder horse and atlantis operations in the region , the former of which was damaged by hurricane dennis last year , are at last expected to start pumping oil later this year .
the company is also beginning to see oil flow from its drilling platforms in the caspian sea and in the waters off angola .
but analysts warn that , in the coming years , the picture for bp may not entirely be a rosy one .
the success of its russian interests somewhat overshadow industry projections for a dip in oil production elsewhere in the company .
' uncertainties ' investment bank goldman sachs estimates that , excluding tnk-bp , production will have fallen by 3 % in 2005 from 2004 .
bp needs to spend more on developing oil resources in order to meet the " challenge " of boosting its growth performance , says matthew lanstone , a senior oil analyst with goldman sachs .
" what we want to see from bp is the evidence of what they are investing in in the medium to long term , " he says .
bp 's exposure to the " uncertainties " of russian politics is also a point of concern , analysts at deutsche bank said in a recent research note .
bp chief executive lord browne flew to moscow in april last year for talks with president vladimir putin to " clarify " the position of foreign investors after tnk-bp was hit with a $ 936m government demand for back taxes .
moscow 's flexing of its muscles in the energy sector - which saw state-owned firm gazprom temporarily cut off gas supplies to neighbouring ukraine - as well as new rules for the foreign ownership of russian companies and export tax rises , all have implications for bp .
but while the potential pickings from russia 's vast resources remain so rich , and as long as the powers that be allow bp to profit from the oil that flows , it is unlikely that bp 's bosses will be having any immediate second thoughts about their russian venture .

surging world crude prices have helped boost the oil firm 's fortunes , and bp has just unveiled 2005 full-year profits of $ 19.31bn -lrb- £ 11.04bn -rrb- .
that marks a heady leap from the previous year 's profits of $ 16.2bn.
but 2005 has also been a bruising year for bp .
the company was forced to deal with the fallout of a fatal fire in march at its huge texas city refinery in the us , as well as disruption later in the year to its oil production in the wake of hurricane katrina .
russian venture bp 's full-year figures failed to top those of anglo-dutch rival shell , which last week reported annual profits of $ 22.94bn - a record for a uk-listed company .
what we want to see from bp is the evidence of what they are investing in in the medium to long term matthew lanstone , senior oil analyst , goldman sachs check bp 's shares but bp remains the bigger of europe 's two leading oil producers when measured by stock market value , and is currently worth $ 239bn to shell 's $ 222bn .
bp has scored some notable successes in recent years , including its move into the massive oil fields of russia through a lucrative 2003 joint venture with russian oil company tnk .
tnk-bp currently accounts for roughly a quarter of bp 's overall production of about 4 million barrels a day .
analysts at goldman sachs estimate that the uk firm has already recouped some $ 3.6bn from a total investment of less than $ 10bn .
growth in upstream production - the amount of oil bp actually extracts from the ground - is also expected to remain strong over the coming two to three years .
future oil despite setbacks along the us gulf coast - bp warned investors last month that the damage caused by the recent devastating hurricane season would cost it more than $ 1bn in 2005 - the company still expects to benefit from its presence in the gulf of mexico .
lord browne has worked to boost bp 's presence in russia bp 's giant thunder horse and atlantis operations in the region , the former of which was damaged by hurricane dennis last year , are at last expected to start pumping oil later this year .
the company is also beginning to see oil flow from its drilling platforms in the caspian sea and in the waters off angola .
but analysts warn that , in the coming years , the picture for bp may not entirely be a rosy one .
the success of its russian interests somewhat overshadow industry projections for a dip in oil production elsewhere in the company .
' uncertainties ' investment bank goldman sachs estimates that , excluding tnk-bp , production will have fallen by 3 % in 2005 from 2004 .
bp needs to spend more on developing oil resources in order to meet the " challenge " of boosting its growth performance , says matthew lanstone , a senior oil analyst with goldman sachs .
" what we want to see from bp is the evidence of what they are investing in in the medium to long term , " he says .
bp 's exposure to the " uncertainties " of russian politics is also a point of concern , analysts at deutsche bank said in a recent research note .
bp chief executive lord browne flew to moscow in april last year for talks with president vladimir putin to " clarify " the position of foreign investors after tnk-bp was hit with a $ 936m government demand for back taxes .
moscow 's flexing of its muscles in the energy sector - which saw state-owned firm gazprom temporarily cut off gas supplies to neighbouring ukraine - as well as new rules for the foreign ownership of russian companies and export tax rises , all have implications for bp .
but while the potential pickings from russia 's vast resources remain so rich , and as long as the powers that be allow bp to profit from the oil that flows , it is unlikely that bp 's bosses will be having any immediate second thoughts about their russian venture .

over the years it has often been said the great and good who dole out the academy awards are out of step with public taste .
not this year .
looking at the 2006 nominations , it 's clear the american public 's mounting indifference to costly blockbusters has been reflected by the oscar voters .
of the five films up for best picture , only one - steven spielberg 's munich - has a budget in excess of $ 14m -lrb- £ 8m -rrb- .
but a more telling statistic is the fact that you could make five brokeback mountains or 10 capotes for what it took to bring spielberg 's $ 75m -lrb- £ 42m -rrb- epic to the screen .
the studios learned to their cost last summer that spending immense sums on the likes of stealth , the island and xxx : state of the union was no guarantee of financial success .
now it has learned it does not bring them any closer to awards either , even with previous oscar winners like spielberg , peter jackson or ron howard at the helm .
the three nominations for howard 's boxing drama cinderella man represents a disappointing return on universal 's $ 88m -lrb- £ 50m -rrb- investment .
and for the $ 200m -lrb- £ 113m -rrb- it lavished on jackson 's king kong remake - his first film since the oscar-laden return of the king - it might have expected more than the four nods it received , all in minor categories .
sony has fared better with memoirs of a geisha , which cost $ 85m -lrb- £ 48m -rrb- and landed six nominations .
main nominations brokeback mountain - 8 crash - 6 good night , and good luck - 6 memoirs of a geisha - 6 capote - 5 munich - 5 walk the line - 5 pride and prejudice - 4 the constant gardener - 4 king kong - 4 click here for the nominations in full for that kind of money , however , it must surely be a disappointment that none of them is for best picture , director or actress .
compare that with paul haggis 's race-themed drama crash , which managed exactly the same tally for a tenth of the price .
with those kind of economics on its side , the independent sector can afford to crow .
and regardless who triumphs on oscar night , the real winners are the discerning filmgoers who have been treated to a surfeit of intelligent , quality cinema that is not afraid to tackle weighty and provocative themes .
if history is anything to go by , though , the studios may have the last laugh .
with none of the best picture nominees so far grossing more than $ 55m -lrb- £ 31m -rrb- , broadcaster abc is already bracing itself for a ratings disappointment .
conventional wisdom dictates that audiences are unlikely to tune in to an awards ceremony where the main contenders are movies they will probably not have seen .
and it 's a point of view borne out by the statistics .
in 1998 , the year that global blockbuster titanic swept the board , the oscar telecast attracted 55 million viewers - its biggest ever audience .
compare that with 1997 , when only 40.1 million saw the english patient crowned best picture .
the independents may well beat the majors this year .
but how many people will see them do it ?

after a disappointing 2005 for the us box office , this year 's oscar nominations shunned expensive studio product in favour of edgier , low-budget fare .
over the years it has often been said the great and good who dole out the academy awards are out of step with public taste .
not this year .
looking at the 2006 nominations , it 's clear the american public 's mounting indifference to costly blockbusters has been reflected by the oscar voters .
of the five films up for best picture , only one - steven spielberg 's munich - has a budget in excess of $ 14m -lrb- £ 8m -rrb- .
but a more telling statistic is the fact that you could make five brokeback mountains or 10 capotes for what it took to bring spielberg 's $ 75m -lrb- £ 42m -rrb- epic to the screen . ... you could get 11 crashes the studios learned to their cost last summer that spending immense sums on the likes of stealth , the island and xxx : state of the union was no guarantee of financial success .
now it has learned it does not bring them any closer to awards either , even with previous oscar winners like spielberg , peter jackson or ron howard at the helm .

on thursday , scotland 's 32 local authorities are expected to announce council tax rises averaging about 4.5 % .
cosla has claimed that the executive has been imposing increasing policy demands upon councils , which face a funding shortfall of £ 400m in 2006/07 .
however , ministers said councils have had " unprecedented " budget rises .
the hard facts are that scottish local government is under-funded cosla open letter the expected rise in the average council tax bill will come despite first minister jack mcconnell insisting that increases should be kept to 2.5 % , roughly in line with inflation .
local authority body cosla said that , without more funding from the executive , households could face hikes of up to 15 % in their bills the following year .
these combined rises would increase the current average band d bill by £ 221 to £ 1,315 in april 2007 .
the executive , which provides 80 % of local authority budgets with the rest coming from council tax , will provide £ 8.3bn core funding for 2006-7 and has proposed £ 8.5bn for 2007-8 .
cosla said the funding shortfall meant tough decisions had to be made over whether to keep bill rises down or cut local services .
capping powers councils also face a £ 560m bill to meet historic equal pay obligations to staff and millions more to avoid future legal action .
finance minister tom mccabe has questioned the financial performance of some highly-paid council officials in allowing equal pay liabilities to accumulate .
mr mccabe has hinted that he may consider using the executive 's capping powers to block very large rises in bills .
the finance minister questioned the performance of council officials however , in an open letter issued on monday night and signed by cosla president pat watters , the local authorities accused ministers of trying to deflect attention from the " primary " issue of under-funding .
it stated : " the executive calls for a mature debate and then goes on to contradict itself by speaking about six-figure salaries , outrageous financial incompetence , threats to re-organise , attacks on our staff and selects some authorities as being beacons of good practice .
" the executive should also be ashamed of themselves for consistently using the threat of re-organisation to bully us into silence .
" the hard facts are that scottish local government is under-funded , and the executive is resorting to bully boy scare tactics because it is losing the reasoned and evidenced argument . "
however the executive said councils had " enjoyed unprecedented increases in funding since devolution " , amounting to 55 % between 1999 and 2007-08 .
a spokesman said : " when the finance committee took evidence from cosla on 24 january , chief executive rory mair said councils hold £ 1bn of reserves , of which 25 % was unallocated .
" figures reported from councils show the actual figure is nearer £ 1.5bn , but if you take even the cosla figure at face value , that means councils have £ 250m which could be used to exert downward pressure on council tax rises or meet other pressures . "

after strong growth in the run-up to christmas , the brc said stores now faced the reality of a " tough market " .
total sales were 3.4 % higher in january than the year before .
but like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - rose by just 0.2 % .
the brc said it was the weakest start to the year since its survey began .
like-for-like sales in the three months to january were up by 1.1 % on the previous quarter .
call for rate cut " the squeeze on consumer spending continues unabated " kevin hawkins , brc director general the brc 's findings echoed those of a survey published last week by the cbi , which also found that the pre-christmas spending surge was not maintained into the new year .
the brc said trading fell back significantly after the clearance sales ended .
while shoppers were taking advantage of cut-price promotions , people were still unwilling to splash out on larger purchases .
" after the pre-christmas upturn , we are now back to the reality of a tough , discount-driven retail market , " said brc director general kevin hawkins .
" the message from every sector of our industry is the same .
the squeeze on consumer spending continues unabated .
the economy badly needs a cut in interest rates . "
the bank of england 's rate-setting committee meets later this week , but most analysts are expecting uk interest rates to remain on hold at 4.5 % .
despite calls for a rate cut from retailers , analysts say the bank will also be keeping its eye on the recent signs of a recovery in the housing market and possible inflationary pressures from high oil prices .

the bank of england 's rate-setting committee meets later this week , but most analysts are expecting uk interest rates to remain on hold at 4.5 % .

they have joined with venture capital firms to plough $ 22m -lrb- £ 12.6m -rrb- into fon , a three-month-old spanish start-up .
fon , which has already attracted 3,000 subscribers , aims to build a network of broadband users to share connections wirelessly when away from home .
a recent survey showed that few laptop owners use wi-fi outside their homes .
according to a survey by electronics firm toshiba , about 20 % of laptop owners did not know how to use wireless functions , while 25 % thought wireless existing " hotspots " were too expensive .
befriending isps fon hopes to use the new cash and high-level backing to fund its efforts to convince internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- of the benefits of its business plan .
it 's an awesome idea just like napster was , with all the consequences that come with it roger entner , ovum most isps ban the public sharing of wireless internet connections .
but fon founder martin varsavsky said his business model was compatible with the isps ' priorities .
" you first have to become a customer of an isp , " he told the reuters news agency .
" we befriend the isps by sharing revenue . "
action plan the company , which put its service live in november , envisages a three-tiered system of shared wi-fi use .
full members , each known as a " linus " , have full access to a global network of fon-enabled wi-fi connections .
business users were early adopters of wi-fi technology in return each linus offers their own connection for others to share .
fon users are required to install fon software onto their wireless router that demands a unique id and password from everyone trying to log onto the hotspot .
the amount of bandwidth reserved for communal connections can be limited by the primary account holder .
other tiers envisage a more casual pay-as-you-go type of access , divided between " bills " , who charge for access to their networks , and " aliens " , who pay to use them .
neither of these levels are active at the moment .
foneros unite mr varsavsky has described his ambitions in terms of a social movement .
many laptop users are put off by high hotspot prices " as ' foneros ' continue to join , and there are more and more fonero hotspots , the dream of a unified global broadband wireless signal becomes a reality , " he wrote on his website .
" the fon movement , as we call it , can achieve what 3g or evdo -lsb- a mobile internet standard -rsb- has not - a truly broadband wireless internet everywhere .
" 3g / evdo are great for coverage , but their throughput is pitiful compared to wi-fi and they are way too expensive . "
roger entner , an analyst with market research firm ovum , said the idea could be revolutionary - in terms of both its potential and its possible pitfalls .
" it 's an awesome idea just like napster was , with all the consequences that come with it , " he said .
" it 's a great idea , but you are breaking the law .
it is treating wi-fi as communal property when it is not . "
in its terms and conditions , fon says users should check with their internet provider to ensure they have permission to share a connection .
it also stresses that users should comply with all national rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content .

they have been told they are not eligible because they were officially classed as surface workers - despite spending large spells underground .
durham north mp kevan jones is raising their plight to the house of commons .
he wants urgent action to help surface workers and their families claim the compensation he says they deserve .
ex-mineworkers and their families have claimed more than £ 700m in recent years , after a scheme agreed between solicitors and the government enabled thousands of cases to be processed .
but workers who were based on the surface , rather than underground , are not covered by the scheme .
surface workers the department for trade and industry initially agreed that surface workers ' illnesses were caused by coal dust but now say there is insufficient medical evidence .
mr jones secured a parliamentary debate on the problems faced by former surface-based workers in trying to claim compensation for mining-related illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -lrb- copd -rrb- .
he said : " the department for trade and industry needs to accept that surface workers were seriously affected by dust , just as underground workers were .

sections of the m1 between leics and south yorkshire will be extended to five lanes in a £ 1.9bn project .
but the " no widening of the m1 " group said the move would generate more traffic and increase pollution levels .
the highways agency is to expand three-lane sections into four with an additional crawler lane on hills for lorries to use .
' journey reliability ' sam brown , of the opposition group , said : " you ca n't build your way out of congestion .
" it 's been proved by the government 's own transport white papers that increasing the capacity of roads does not reduce congestion .
" in fact it increases the amount of traffic - which has been proved recently by a study on the newbury bypass where traffic has increased by 50 % in the first five years of it being built . "
a public consultation exercise is to begin in the spring on the widening of the motorway by one lane between junction 21 at leicester and junction 30 at chesterfield .
tony turton , of the highways agency , said : " journey times are predicted to rise on this particular section between 50 % and 60 % by 2030 .
" this project will create additional capacity to allow that traffic to flow efficiently .
" the main aim is really to improve journey time reliability , improve roads user safety and reduce driver stress . "
construction work is scheduled to begin in 2007 .

a report recently revealed the elderly face bullying , neglect and violence . "
registration is something we have called for for a while .
it will help improve the standards of staff " gary fitzgerald , action on elder abuse care homes ' fail on drugs ' the help the aged study suggested as many as 500,000 were abused at any one time with carers as well as families and friends being responsible .
mr byrne , who has also unveiled a £ 600,000 research project to look at elderly abuse , said registration should improve safety .
" it will enable older people and their families to have complete confidence in the people who are for them , or their loved ones .
" registration is about public safety .
" it will allow us to train our care workers to look after our vulnerable people properly . "
social workers the social care workforce includes social workers , nursing home workers and home-help staff who work for 30,000 companies , councils and charities .
but to date , the only formal registration in place is for social workers .
mr byrne added : " we know there are lots of excellent care workers out there , and they are the mainstay of our society .
" their dedication should be recognised with professional registration .
" however , they are not yet a world-class workforce . "
the announcement comes as a report by the commission for social care inspection found nearly half of england 's nursing and care homes fail to meet minimum drug prescribing standards by giving the wrong medication , wrong dose or no drugs at all .

" the society estimates that even though three quarters of people in care homes have some form of dementia , only 10 % of care home staff have any training . "
and he added : " registration may also help to raise the status of social care staff .
we need a cultural shift towards placing a higher value on care work , which is currently an under paid , under trained , under valued sector . "

care services minister liam byrne has asked the general social care council to look into a way of introducing a system of registration and training .
more than 1.6m people work in social care , but only one in four - mostly social workers - have formal training .
a report recently revealed the elderly face bullying , neglect and violence .
registration is something we have called for for a while .
it will help improve the standards of staff gary fitzgerald , action on elder abuse care homes ' fail on drugs ' the help the aged study suggested as many as 500,000 were abused at any one time with carers as well as families and friends being responsible .
mr byrne , who has also unveiled a £ 600,000 research project to look at elderly abuse , said registration should improve safety .
" it will enable older people and their families to have complete confidence in the people who are for them , or their loved ones .
" registration is about public safety .
" it will allow us to train our care workers to look after our vulnerable people properly . "
social workers the social care workforce includes social workers , nursing home workers and home-help staff who work for 30,000 companies , councils and charities .
but to date , the only formal registration in place is for social workers .
mr byrne added : " we know there are lots of excellent care workers out there , and they are the mainstay of our society .
" their dedication should be recognised with professional registration .
" however , they are not yet a world-class workforce . "
the announcement comes as a report by the commission for social care inspection found nearly half of england 's nursing and care homes fail to meet minimum drug prescribing standards by giving the wrong medication , wrong dose or no drugs at all .
gary fitzgerald , chief executive of action on elder abuse , said registration would help improved prescribing , but added the benefits went much further than that .
" registration is something we have called for for a while .
it will help improve the standards of staff and , hopefully , will help change the attitude and approach to elderly people . "
but he said the registration scheme had to be introduced with a " stronger and more robust " inspection system .
clive evers , director of information and education at the alzheimer 's society , said the registration could benefit people with alzheimer 's .
" despite the specialist skills required to care for a person with dementia , only a very small proportion of care staff currently receive adequate training .
" the society estimates that even though three quarters of people in care homes have some form of dementia , only 10 % of care home staff have any training . "
and he added : " registration may also help to raise the status of social care staff .
we need a cultural shift towards placing a higher value on care work , which is currently an under paid , under trained , under valued sector . "

the monument blocks the view of scrolling illuminated messages - some of them about human rights - displayed on the building by american diplomats .
it consists of 138 black flags with a white star .
havana says it symbolises the people who have died as the result of violent acts against cuba since its 1959 revolution - more than 3,400 of them .
vigil the monument was unveiled during a ceremony organised by the government to honour victims of what it considers us-sponsored violence against cuba .
" they are white stars over a black background , representing the light of a people that are in pain and mourning for their children and families , " said professor carlos alberto cremata , standing next to president castro .
mr cremata is the son of the co-pilot of a cuban airliner which was bombed in 1976 , killing all 73 people aboard .
after the flags were raised , cubans began a 24-hour vigil in front of the us mission , holding posters with the faces of the dead .
the us mission in havana began displaying the electronic messages in january .
president castro described the scrolling messages as a gross provocation , and soon turned what had once been the car park of the building into a major construction site .
huge cranes were brought in and teams of builders worked there non-stop .
but no-one would say what was being built - not even president castro - until the monument was unveiled on monday .
the propaganda war between the us and cuba is nothing new - but correspondents say this is an escalation .
already cuba has put up scores of posters in the capital caricaturing president bush as both a fascist and a vampire .
the two countries have not had diplomatic links for 45 years .

the monument blocks the view of scrolling illuminated messages - some of them about human rights - displayed on the building by american diplomats .
it consists of 138 black flags with a white star .
havana says it symbolises the people who have died as the result of violent acts against cuba since its 1959 revolution - more than 3,400 of them .
vigil the monument was unveiled during a ceremony organised by the government to honour victims of what it considers us-sponsored violence against cuba .
" they are white stars over a black background , representing the light of a people that are in pain and mourning for their children and families , " said professor carlos alberto cremata , standing next to president castro .
fidel castro had condemned the us messages as a " gross provocation " mr cremata is the son of the co-pilot of a cuban airliner which was bombed in 1976 , killing all 73 people aboard .
after the flags were raised , cubans began a 24-hour vigil in front of the us mission , holding posters with the faces of the dead .
the us mission in havana began displaying the electronic messages in january .
president castro described the scrolling messages as a gross provocation , and soon turned what had once been the car park of the building into a major construction site .
huge cranes were brought in and teams of builders worked there non-stop .
but no-one would say what was being built - not even president castro - until the monument was unveiled on monday .
the propaganda war between the us and cuba is nothing new - but correspondents say this is an escalation .
