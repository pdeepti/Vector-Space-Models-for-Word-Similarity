the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .

" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .

" the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .

we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .

what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts disagree on how to prevent sex offenders from committing new crimes saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood . saxony has been shaken up by the case of 13-year-old stefanie , who was kidnapped by a convicted sex offender on her way to school in dresden on jan .
11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .

that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts disagree on how to prevent sex offenders from committing new crimes saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood . saxony has been shaken up by the case of 13-year-old stefanie , who was kidnapped by a convicted sex offender on her way to school in dresden on jan .
11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts disagree on how to prevent sex offenders from committing new crimes saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood . saxony has been shaken up by the case of 13-year-old stefanie , who was kidnapped by a convicted sex offender on her way to school in dresden on jan .
11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german firms hike budgets for core research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big investments in r & d can help germany keep its good name the amount of money companies spend on research and development is an indicator of how innovative a society is .
this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business spends its r and d budgets on applied resaerch " should this continue , germany as a center for science risks sustained damage , " hambrecht said .
" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .
in germany , every fourth euro invested comes from foreign firms .
many of the companies were previously in german hands but were acquired by foreign firms which left their r & d departments in germany .
some foreign companies , such as , general electric , have also established research centers in germany .
ge uses its lab near munich to better cooperate with southern german universities and institutes .
promoting knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ge opened a research center in garching , near munich , in 2004 european companies accounted for 60 percent of the internal r & d carried out by foreign firms in germany in 2003 and north american companies made up nearly 37 percent , according to andreas schlüter , head of the stifterverband . and german companies also engage in r & d abroad as a result of multinational business structures , schlüter said . " the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .
instead it will be because the german government and german companies spend too little on knowledge and risk missing out on future developments . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?

a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .

" spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france .

the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german firms hike budgets for core research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big investments in r & d can help germany keep its good name the amount of money companies spend on research and development is an indicator of how innovative a society is .
this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business spends its r and d budgets on applied resaerch " should this continue , germany as a center for science risks sustained damage , " hambrecht said .
" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .
in germany , every fourth euro invested comes from foreign firms .
many of the companies were previously in german hands but were acquired by foreign firms which left their r & d departments in germany .
some foreign companies , such as , general electric , have also established research centers in germany .
ge uses its lab near munich to better cooperate with southern german universities and institutes .
promoting knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ge opened a research center in garching , near munich , in 2004 european companies accounted for 60 percent of the internal r & d carried out by foreign firms in germany in 2003 and north american companies made up nearly 37 percent , according to andreas schlüter , head of the stifterverband . and german companies also engage in r & d abroad as a result of multinational business structures , schlüter said . " the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .
instead it will be because the german government and german companies spend too little on knowledge and risk missing out on future developments . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france .

ahead of the friendly match against italy , rudi völler spoke to dw-world.de about germany 's chances in the world cup . dw-world.de : how would you assess the german national soccer team ? rudi völler : we played a very good confederations cup last summer .
of course we 're among the favorites for the world cup in our own country - and rightly so .
we have the audience on our side .
we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .
they had just started then .
now -lrb- coach -rrb- jürgen klinsmann has taken on other young players to lay the foundation for coming years .
i think the team will reach its true strength after the world cup or even in two or four years , because all these players will then be at their zenith .
we can sit back and look positively toward the future , and with the many young players we 'll have a proper team in the coming years . what do you think of the rotation of goalies oliver kahn and jens lehmann ? i ca n't judge it and do n't want to .
jürgen klinsmann has to do that ; he 's responsible for it . michael ballack played for many years in leverkusen where you are sports director .
what kind of progress has he made at bayern munich ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- center -rrb- - best world cup player ? michael ballack has improved continually in the past few years .
he is a world-class player .
there 's no mid-field player in the world who 's more likely to make goals than michael ballack .
the proportion of goals he 's made , whether in the national team or with bayern , it 's sensational .
the most important player in germany , no question about it . you played in the world cup three times and then took part as a coach .
what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .
but the group wo n't be a big obstacle .
the most dangerous opponent will surely be poland . qu xiao interviewed rudi völler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?

a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german firms hike budgets for core research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big investments in r & d can help germany keep its good name the amount of money companies spend on research and development is an indicator of how innovative a society is .
this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business spends its r and d budgets on applied resaerch " should this continue , germany as a center for science risks sustained damage , " hambrecht said .
" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .
in germany , every fourth euro invested comes from foreign firms .
many of the companies were previously in german hands but were acquired by foreign firms which left their r & d departments in germany .
some foreign companies , such as , general electric , have also established research centers in germany .
ge uses its lab near munich to better cooperate with southern german universities and institutes .
promoting knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ge opened a research center in garching , near munich , in 2004 european companies accounted for 60 percent of the internal r & d carried out by foreign firms in germany in 2003 and north american companies made up nearly 37 percent , according to andreas schlüter , head of the stifterverband . and german companies also engage in r & d abroad as a result of multinational business structures , schlüter said . " the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .

" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .
in germany , every fourth euro invested comes from foreign firms .
many of the companies were previously in german hands but were acquired by foreign firms which left their r & d departments in germany .

" the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .
" i do n't want that to happen in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german firms hike budgets for core research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big investments in r & d can help germany keep its good name the amount of money companies spend on research and development is an indicator of how innovative a society is .
this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business spends its r and d budgets on applied resaerch " should this continue , germany as a center for science risks sustained damage , " hambrecht said .
" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .
in germany , every fourth euro invested comes from foreign firms .
many of the companies were previously in german hands but were acquired by foreign firms which left their r & d departments in germany .
some foreign companies , such as , general electric , have also established research centers in germany .
ge uses its lab near munich to better cooperate with southern german universities and institutes .
promoting knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ge opened a research center in garching , near munich , in 2004 european companies accounted for 60 percent of the internal r & d carried out by foreign firms in germany in 2003 and north american companies made up nearly 37 percent , according to andreas schlüter , head of the stifterverband . and german companies also engage in r & d abroad as a result of multinational business structures , schlüter said . " the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .
instead it will be because the german government and german companies spend too little on knowledge and risk missing out on future developments . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration .

" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts disagree on how to prevent sex offenders from committing new crimes saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood . saxony has been shaken up by the case of 13-year-old stefanie , who was kidnapped by a convicted sex offender on her way to school in dresden on jan .
11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims a clear conscience in the iraq war a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims a clear conscience in the iraq war a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2006 merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suez energy group is at the center of the latest row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms . the latest row over the question of free markets versus " economic patriotism " is between france and italy .
the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .
" you get the impression that there 's not much really moving and ask yourself whether the optimism is really justified . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity .

ahead of the friendly match against italy , rudi völler spoke to dw-world.de about germany 's chances in the world cup . dw-world.de : how would you assess the german national soccer team ? rudi völler : we played a very good confederations cup last summer .
of course we 're among the favorites for the world cup in our own country - and rightly so .
we have the audience on our side .
we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .
they had just started then .
now -lrb- coach -rrb- jürgen klinsmann has taken on other young players to lay the foundation for coming years .
i think the team will reach its true strength after the world cup or even in two or four years , because all these players will then be at their zenith .
we can sit back and look positively toward the future , and with the many young players we 'll have a proper team in the coming years . what do you think of the rotation of goalies oliver kahn and jens lehmann ? i ca n't judge it and do n't want to .
jürgen klinsmann has to do that ; he 's responsible for it . michael ballack played for many years in leverkusen where you are sports director .
what kind of progress has he made at bayern munich ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- center -rrb- - best world cup player ? michael ballack has improved continually in the past few years .
he is a world-class player .
there 's no mid-field player in the world who 's more likely to make goals than michael ballack .
the proportion of goals he 's made , whether in the national team or with bayern , it 's sensational .
the most important player in germany , no question about it . you played in the world cup three times and then took part as a coach .
what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .
but the group wo n't be a big obstacle .

ahead of the friendly match against italy , rudi völler spoke to dw-world.de about germany 's chances in the world cup . dw-world.de : how would you assess the german national soccer team ? rudi völler : we played a very good confederations cup last summer .
of course we 're among the favorites for the world cup in our own country - and rightly so .
we have the audience on our side .
we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .
they had just started then .
now -lrb- coach -rrb- jürgen klinsmann has taken on other young players to lay the foundation for coming years .
i think the team will reach its true strength after the world cup or even in two or four years , because all these players will then be at their zenith .
we can sit back and look positively toward the future , and with the many young players we 'll have a proper team in the coming years . what do you think of the rotation of goalies oliver kahn and jens lehmann ? i ca n't judge it and do n't want to .
jürgen klinsmann has to do that ; he 's responsible for it . michael ballack played for many years in leverkusen where you are sports director .
what kind of progress has he made at bayern munich ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- center -rrb- - best world cup player ? michael ballack has improved continually in the past few years .
he is a world-class player .
there 's no mid-field player in the world who 's more likely to make goals than michael ballack .
the proportion of goals he 's made , whether in the national team or with bayern , it 's sensational .
the most important player in germany , no question about it . you played in the world cup three times and then took part as a coach .
what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .
but the group wo n't be a big obstacle .
the most dangerous opponent will surely be poland . qu xiao interviewed rudi völler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2006 merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suez energy group is at the center of the latest row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms . the latest row over the question of free markets versus " economic patriotism " is between france and italy .
the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business spends its r and d budgets on applied resaerch " should this continue , germany as a center for science risks sustained damage , " hambrecht said .
" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .
in germany , every fourth euro invested comes from foreign firms .
many of the companies were previously in german hands but were acquired by foreign firms which left their r & d departments in germany .
some foreign companies , such as , general electric , have also established research centers in germany .
ge uses its lab near munich to better cooperate with southern german universities and institutes .
promoting knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ge opened a research center in garching , near munich , in 2004 european companies accounted for 60 percent of the internal r & d carried out by foreign firms in germany in 2003 and north american companies made up nearly 37 percent , according to andreas schlüter , head of the stifterverband . and german companies also engage in r & d abroad as a result of multinational business structures , schlüter said . " the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .
instead it will be because the german government and german companies spend too little on knowledge and risk missing out on future developments . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2006 merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suez energy group is at the center of the latest row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms . the latest row over the question of free markets versus " economic patriotism " is between france and italy .
the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .
the repairs are expected to be completed in 2007 . in 1999 , unesco declared the museum island a world cultural heritage site . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin reveals cultural gem after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .
" you get the impression that there 's not much really moving and ask yourself whether the optimism is really justified . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .

" anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts disagree on how to prevent sex offenders from committing new crimes saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood . saxony has been shaken up by the case of 13-year-old stefanie , who was kidnapped by a convicted sex offender on her way to school in dresden on jan .
11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2006 merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suez energy group is at the center of the latest row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms . the latest row over the question of free markets versus " economic patriotism " is between france and italy .
the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

ahead of the friendly match against italy , rudi völler spoke to dw-world.de about germany 's chances in the world cup . dw-world.de : how would you assess the german national soccer team ? rudi völler : we played a very good confederations cup last summer .
of course we 're among the favorites for the world cup in our own country - and rightly so .
we have the audience on our side .
we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .
they had just started then .
now -lrb- coach -rrb- jürgen klinsmann has taken on other young players to lay the foundation for coming years .
i think the team will reach its true strength after the world cup or even in two or four years , because all these players will then be at their zenith .
we can sit back and look positively toward the future , and with the many young players we 'll have a proper team in the coming years . what do you think of the rotation of goalies oliver kahn and jens lehmann ? i ca n't judge it and do n't want to .
jürgen klinsmann has to do that ; he 's responsible for it . michael ballack played for many years in leverkusen where you are sports director .
what kind of progress has he made at bayern munich ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- center -rrb- - best world cup player ? michael ballack has improved continually in the past few years .
he is a world-class player .
there 's no mid-field player in the world who 's more likely to make goals than michael ballack .
the proportion of goals he 's made , whether in the national team or with bayern , it 's sensational .
the most important player in germany , no question about it . you played in the world cup three times and then took part as a coach .
what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .
but the group wo n't be a big obstacle .
the most dangerous opponent will surely be poland . qu xiao interviewed rudi völler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2006 merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suez energy group is at the center of the latest row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms . the latest row over the question of free markets versus " economic patriotism " is between france and italy .
the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .

" the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .
" you get the impression that there 's not much really moving and ask yourself whether the optimism is really justified . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .

" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .
" you get the impression that there 's not much really moving and ask yourself whether the optimism is really justified .

of course we 're among the favorites for the world cup in our own country - and rightly so .
we have the audience on our side .
we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .

despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .

i think the team will reach its true strength after the world cup or even in two or four years , because all these players will then be at their zenith .
we can sit back and look positively toward the future , and with the many young players we 'll have a proper team in the coming years . what do you think of the rotation of goalies oliver kahn and jens lehmann ? i ca n't judge it and do n't want to .
jürgen klinsmann has to do that ; he 's responsible for it . michael ballack played for many years in leverkusen where you are sports director .
what kind of progress has he made at bayern munich ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- center -rrb- - best world cup player ? michael ballack has improved continually in the past few years .
he is a world-class player .
there 's no mid-field player in the world who 's more likely to make goals than michael ballack .
the proportion of goals he 's made , whether in the national team or with bayern , it 's sensational .
the most important player in germany , no question about it . you played in the world cup three times and then took part as a coach .
what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .
but the group wo n't be a big obstacle .
the most dangerous opponent will surely be poland . qu xiao interviewed rudi völler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 opinion : who 's taking aim at berlin ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims a clear conscience in the iraq war a news report claiming german secret agents gave the us iraq 's war plans has drawn indignant denials from both berlin and washington .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .
they had just started then .
now -lrb- coach -rrb- jürgen klinsmann has taken on other young players to lay the foundation for coming years .
i think the team will reach its true strength after the world cup or even in two or four years , because all these players will then be at their zenith .
we can sit back and look positively toward the future , and with the many young players we 'll have a proper team in the coming years . what do you think of the rotation of goalies oliver kahn and jens lehmann ? i ca n't judge it and do n't want to .
jürgen klinsmann has to do that ; he 's responsible for it . michael ballack played for many years in leverkusen where you are sports director .
what kind of progress has he made at bayern munich ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- center -rrb- - best world cup player ? michael ballack has improved continually in the past few years .
he is a world-class player .
there 's no mid-field player in the world who 's more likely to make goals than michael ballack .
the proportion of goals he 's made , whether in the national team or with bayern , it 's sensational .
the most important player in germany , no question about it . you played in the world cup three times and then took part as a coach .
what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .

" the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .

" the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .

" the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business spends its r and d budgets on applied resaerch " should this continue , germany as a center for science risks sustained damage , " hambrecht said .
" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .
in germany , every fourth euro invested comes from foreign firms .
many of the companies were previously in german hands but were acquired by foreign firms which left their r & d departments in germany .
some foreign companies , such as , general electric , have also established research centers in germany .
ge uses its lab near munich to better cooperate with southern german universities and institutes .
promoting knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ge opened a research center in garching , near munich , in 2004 european companies accounted for 60 percent of the internal r & d carried out by foreign firms in germany in 2003 and north american companies made up nearly 37 percent , according to andreas schlüter , head of the stifterverband . and german companies also engage in r & d abroad as a result of multinational business structures , schlüter said . " the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .
instead it will be because the german government and german companies spend too little on knowledge and risk missing out on future developments . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .

surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .
" you get the impression that there 's not much really moving and ask yourself whether the optimism is really justified . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity .

we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .

ahead of the friendly match against italy , rudi völler spoke to dw-world.de about germany 's chances in the world cup . dw-world.de : how would you assess the german national soccer team ? rudi völler : we played a very good confederations cup last summer .
of course we 're among the favorites for the world cup in our own country - and rightly so .
we have the audience on our side .
we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .
they had just started then .
now -lrb- coach -rrb- jürgen klinsmann has taken on other young players to lay the foundation for coming years .
i think the team will reach its true strength after the world cup or even in two or four years , because all these players will then be at their zenith .
we can sit back and look positively toward the future , and with the many young players we 'll have a proper team in the coming years . what do you think of the rotation of goalies oliver kahn and jens lehmann ? i ca n't judge it and do n't want to .
jürgen klinsmann has to do that ; he 's responsible for it . michael ballack played for many years in leverkusen where you are sports director .
what kind of progress has he made at bayern munich ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack -lrb- center -rrb- - best world cup player ? michael ballack has improved continually in the past few years .
he is a world-class player .
there 's no mid-field player in the world who 's more likely to make goals than michael ballack .
the proportion of goals he 's made , whether in the national team or with bayern , it 's sensational .
the most important player in germany , no question about it . you played in the world cup three times and then took part as a coach .
what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .
but the group wo n't be a big obstacle .
the most dangerous opponent will surely be poland . qu xiao interviewed rudi völler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups .

" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france .

the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?
perhaps washington , outraged at the moral sanctimony with which the former german government voiced its opposition to the iraq war while simultaneously providing its ally with information , is out to discredit germany and former chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration . in berlin , spokespeople for the new government have been quick to deny the claims .
but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .
since 1991 , 62 million euros have already been spent on repairing and modernizing the building that was badly damaged in world war ii . the reconstruction of central berlin 's museum island , where the pergamon museum and four other world class museums are located , is expected to cost 1.5 billion euros in total . " we 're responsible developers , " said prussian cultural heritage foundation head klaus-dieter lehmann , in response to earlier suggestions the work would cost 2 billion euros .
the federal government will pay for the reconstruction , which is expected to take 15 years .
the work will be completed on the basis of plans from cologne architect oswald mathias unger , who won the competition to redesign the building in 2000 .
his design includes a transparent fourth wing for the museum 's monumental egyptian architecture .
each of the museum 's three collections - classical antiquities , islamic art and near eastern antiquities - will be housed in separate wings with individual entrances . it 's not clear yet whether the museum will be open to the public during construction or whether the collections will be shown in other venues . an impressive collection bildunterschrift : the pergamon altar the museum , which was built from 1912 to 1930 , is one of germany 's biggest tourist attractions , with nearly one million visitors yearly .
it possesses one of the world 's largest collections of items from antiquity , including the famous pergamon altar -lrb- 180-159 b.c. -rrb- - in ancient times regarded as one of the wonders of the world - which was recovered from an archeological dig in 1978-86 in what is now turkey .
the building also houses segments of the legendary procession street leading to the gate of ishtar in babylon from the reign of nebuchadnezar ii -lrb- 604-562 b.c. -rrb- and the roman market gate of milet -lrb- 120 b.c. -rrb- . parts of the pediment of the milet gate weighing 100 tons were dismantled last year because experts feared they would otherwise collapse .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .
concurrently , government spending on r & d fell , and with it the amount spent on basic research .

" state investment in basic research must not be cut back further , for that is where the foundations for tomorrow 's products and applications are laid . " basic research is the foundation upon which companies carry out their own applied research .

" the sale of products abroad is followed by the relocation of production facilities abroad , which is followed by the adoption of foreign standards , which is then followed by the development of r & d capacities , " he explained . still , foreign companies spend more on r & d in germany than german firms spent on it abroad .
if germany does lose significance as a center of innovation , it wo n't be because r & d are relocated abroad .

we have a very young team mixed with a couple of good older players .
we can play a very good world cup and get into the finals , no question .
we need a little luck for that , of course .
but it 's possible , like it was four years ago .
brazil is the big favorite of course .
to me that 's a given , because they have the best individual players .
but with good team performance , team spirit , good strategy , our team can get very far . what has changed in the team over the past two years ? even though we were eliminated in the first round of the european cup then , players like podolski and schweinsteiger got a taste of things .
they had just started then .

what does the tournament mean to you ? a world cup is n't just the most important event for me , but for every footballer .
despite all the successes you can have with a club , a world championship is still the very highest .
my best example is always : when you become german champion , it 's nice , but two weeks later no one talks about it anymore .
but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .

but everyone knows who the world champion was in 1970 .
you 'll always be a world champion .
it 's the biggest thing a footballer can accomplish . who 's your world cup tip this time ? brazil is the big favorite .
then there are countries like germany , italy , england , holland , argentina - those are the other top favorites . which team could be good for a surprise ? i believe the african teams could be a surprise .
teams like ivory coast could be a very big surprise . who will be the world cup 's best player ? michael ballack , i hope . in the preliminary round , germany will play poland , costa rica and ecuador .
which team will pose the greatest challenge to germany ? there are certainly groups that are more difficult .
i do think we 'll ride out the preliminary round very well .
but then , from the eighth finals , like in every tournament , what counts is the day 's form .
the team with the best form will make it through the respectable round .
but the group wo n't be a big obstacle .
the most dangerous opponent will surely be poland . qu xiao interviewed rudi völler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .

this year , german firms are boosting their r & d budgets , but will that keep the country on top ? german companies spent less on research and development in 2004 than the previous year , but in 2005 they plan to increase their expenditures to 47 billion euros -lrb- $ 56 billion -rrb- and in 2006 to 48 billion euros , according to a study by the stifterverband für die deutsche wissenschaft , a group that promotes science in germany . the organization gathered information from 1,500 german companies last year and showed that r & d budgets are rising , but only marginally - especially in comparison with the virtual spending sprees of the 1990s , when growth rates hit around 10 percent .
in the future , double-digit growth in r & d ca n't be expected either , according to jürgen hambrecht , ceo of chemical giant basf and deputy head of the stifterverband . but hambrecht said that r & d had made significant advances .
one change has been a scale-down in size .
" they no longer run big pilot facilities , rather they can do many things on a much smaller scale and thus much more quickly make simulations . " the greater efficiency of r & d allows companies to spend less money than in the past to maintain the same level of research .
but knowledge is valued higher by other countries than it is by germany .
in world rankings , israel spends 4.5 percent of its gdp on r & d , sweden spends 4 percent and finland 3.5 percent respectively .
germany , in seventh place behind both the united states and japan , spends only around 2.5 percent of its gdp on r & d. germany 's reputation could suffer the german investments are mainly financed by private business .
their expenditures are continually increasing and had reached 67 percent in 2004 , hambrecht said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : merkel 's record so far it 's the economy , angela chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days opinion : 100 days of angela merkel press review : merkel 's first 100 days germany -pipe- 28.02.2006 new german government has nation in buoyant mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela 's in good spirits , along with the rest of the country , it seems while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .
surveys show increased confidence about the future . they 're not exactly dancing in the streets , but indications are that germans might be seeing the glass as half full these days instead of half empty .
consumer confidence is up , business sentiment higher than it has been in nearly 15 years , and surveys show germans are less worried about their personal economic health and slightly more optimistic about their country 's economic future than they have been in years . according to experts , much of that has to do with satisfaction with the government made up of left-leaning social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- bloc , which will complete 100 days in power on wednesday .
this grand coalition , which was cobbled together after elections last september resulted in only a razor-thin victory for the conservatives , was met with widespread misgivings when it officially took shape last november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doing well in the popularity polls but public opinion shows that much of that doubt has since turned to approval , particularly when it comes to angela merkel , germany 's first female chancellor .
on the german public broadcaster zdf 's political barometer , which rates politicians ' popularity on a scale from -5 to + 5 , merkel scores an average rating of 2.2 .
that is remarkable for a sitting chancellor , most of whom never get above the 0.5 mark . " you 'd have to be a real grouch to say that the government has had a bad start , " paul nolte , author of the books " hazardous modernity " and " the reform generation " and professor of modern history at berlin 's free university , said .
" the change in the -lsb- country 's -rsb- mood is part of the government 's success story . " the nation 's upbeat outlook is reflected in the media , which for years has depicted the country as standing at the edge of the abyss .
now headlines enjoy focusing on the positive , proclaiming " springtime for merkel " or praising a " a can-do culture " - sentiments that would have been considered laughable and delusional by editors just months ago . from the right-of-center frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to the decidedly left-wing taz newspaper , the adjectives used to describe the government and the country 's direction have been , if not glowing , at least overwhelmingly positive . economic upswing german businesses , particularly those who export , have been enjoying strong profits and executives are more optimistic than they have been in years .
a widely watched index of german business sentiment put out by the munich-based ifo institute reported its index rose to 103.3 in february , its highest level since october 1991 . but it 's not just publishers and industry executives who are reveling in the upturn . even ordinary germans are tending to find reasons to smile after years of dour faces .
german consumer confidence is set to improve for a fifth month in a row in march , according to the gfk research group which issued its consumer climate report last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite storming the stores yet , but willing to spend a little more " the overall mood among german consumers is more positive than it has been for many years , " the gfk said in a statement . a higher percentage of germans believe that there is a good chance of economic recovery , according to the institute .
the soccer world cup , to be held in germany this summer , is also likely to play a strong role in the sunny outlook .
economic experts say the event will contribute up to 0.5 percent to gdp growth in the country . why the happy face ? the exact reasons behind the new buoyancy have many analysts scratching their heads .
while german business has taken an overall turn for the better , there are still many serious problems facing the country .
unemployment numbers have again surpassed the five million mark ; automaker volkswagen recently announced it is cutting 20,000 jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good news , bad news - people are buying more vw 's , but the company 's going to lay off 20,000 even merkel 's government has had to announce some unpopular measures such as the cutting of subsidies , raising the retirement age to 67 and increasing the value-added tax by two percentage points in 2007 . " it is really a gap between the communicated state of affairs and reality , " said gero neugebauer , who teaches political sociology at berlin 's otto suhr institute for political science .
" the public mood is much better than one would think it would be in the current situation . " indeed , while consumers are showing more confidence , and companies like volkswagen are reporting double-digit growth over last year , people are still not parting with their money like they might be , perhaps fearful that the party mood wo n't last long .
five years ago , germans saved 9.2 percent of their incomes ; today that number has risen to 10.6 percent .
that takes some 20 billion euros out of the domestic economy . government 's role although the exact reasons are unclear , the current popularity of merkel 's government does appear to be playing a role in the better attitudes across the country , never mind that substantial successes by the new government are still hard to find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few members of merkel 's cabinet the chancellor herself could be benefiting from simply overcoming low expectations , according to neugebauer .
" they 're happy that she is not as bad as it was thought she could be , " he said . her style and that of her government appear to be a breath of fresh air to the populace : more businesslike and modest , less glitzy and gilded than the schröder administration . " the government has not come on board with such high emotional expectations like schröder did , " said nolte .
" it 's a more pragmatic , modest beginning , which has made the thing easier . " merkel has also cut a good figure on the international stage .
while most chancellors attempt to tackle messy domestic issues first , merkel chose to make her debut in cities like paris , washington , moscow and jerusalem .
she proved her leadership and diplomatic credentials , which had been doubted by many , right away , thus earning herself some much-needed leverage on the domestic front . however , when tangled domestic issues such as labor market regulations , health care reform , education and integration do eventually catch up , they could signal the end of the honeymoon for this government . " the important decisions have n't been made yet , " said nolte .
" you get the impression that there 's not much really moving and ask yourself whether the optimism is really justified . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity .

the prussian cultural heritage foundation has said that the work would cost 351 million euros -lrb- $ 416 million -rrb- and would start in 2011 .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .

11 and held captive until police located her five weeks later .
police investigators had not known that stefanie 's attacker lived in the neighborhood .
now the state 's interior minister , albrecht buttolo , wants to laws changed so that the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders . " anyone convicted of a sex offence should be aware they will be watched for the rest of their lives and that their information will be kept on file , " buttolo told dw-tv .
" i believe we have to follow such a hard course to protect the public .
of course there will be discussions over how that can be made law , but i think what crimes those people have committed should be made public . " but germany 's data protection commissioners do not share buttolo 's opinion .
they point out that privacy protection laws also apply to pedophiles .
german legislation prevents information such as a person 's name or place of residence from being made public .
the commissioners are opposed to having a register like in the us , where convicted sex offenders ' names are published online .
proponents say such measures discourage felons from repeating their crimes and help in their detection .
would it make a difference ?
data protection specialists , however , say the german authorities already have enough powers at their disposal to detect sex offenders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman lays down flowers where 12-year-old ulrike was kidnapped and later killed by a sex offender in eberswalde in 2001 " in a case like this there are always calls for us to introduce something new , and people say everything we had up to this point is insufficient , " said andreas schurig , saxony 's data protection commissioner .
" but we already have regulations - here in saxony and in bavaria - that allow police to examine registration files , " he said . all people who live in germany are required by law to register their addresses with local authorities . " the only question is : are the files held by the police - which are partly accessible to all police forces across germany - fully up-to-date with all information , " schurig said .
" if that is the case , the problem has already been solved . " stefanie 's attacker had been released from prison on parole .
he had fulfilled all obligations to register with the authorities , who are not obliged to inform the police about a sex offender 's presence in a community .
they do so only if requested .
when stefanie was found , the police were investigating 50 people in the area with records of sex offences . in the case of such a big manhunt , police also rely on information supplied by the public . " it makes sense for the general population to be aware , but i do n't think it is going to come to a situation in which the houses where these people live will be marked or that a monthly list will be published showing which sex offenders have been released and where they live , " said forensic scientist frank wendt .
" i could imagine the criminals would look for victims further away from their homes and travel greater distances to find them .
there have been a few who 've traveled across the country to commit their crimes . "
sex crimes on the decline german police have a good record when it comes to detecting sex offenders .
the debate about making information about sex offenders public comes at a time when such crimes are declining - without the help of a registry . data protection commissioners are also concerned that if the public knows where to find convicted sex offenders , they could take the law into their own hands .
data protection commissioners fear the proposal could cause more harm than good . " we know about cases in the us where citizens have looked at the register , taken a gun and shot the person on the list , " schurig said .
" i do n't want that to happen in germany .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?

but what option do they have given that the old government in the form of the spd and moreover the social democratic foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , are in the new cabinet ?
following allegations of cia terror flights over europe , he has already born the glare of negative spotlight , and is thus particularly sensitive to these claims . steinmeier under fire ? under schröder , steinmeier was chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services .
a designed indiscretion would , if that is what this is , be a political affront directed at him . but the government 's denials are also plausible .
the claim that german secret agents informed the us in its run-up to an attack of saddam 's secret defense plans is simply ridiculous .
in the days leading up to the outbreak of war , it was easy - for anyone wishing to know - to learn that the iraqis were planning to defend their capital by massing forces in concentric rings around it .
the information was no secret even in washington and among us military experts . what is more explosive is the apparent expectation in us circles , even during the war , that in the absence of any credible informers of their own in baghdad , the two bnd agents would be forthcoming with their information .
what is strange , however , is that at the time , us defense minister donald rumsfeld had already put germany in the same category as libya and cuba . the real scandal is the hypocrisy used to dupe the public on both sides , and there is little that a parliamentary probe in berlin can do to change that , not least because it would certainly not include any testimony from us generals or politicians . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany denies giving baghdad defense plan to us a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz believes the leak must have been carefully planned . the allegations in the new york times have certainly had an effect , not only because of the serious nature of the newspaper in question , but the fact that it cites a secret us military report .
the resulting question is who , in washington , is interested in leaking evidence of cooperation between the german secret service and the us during the iraq war , to the public ? there can , after all , be no doubt that this is about a pointed indiscretion .
how else could the us newspaper get its hands on confidential information , and a sketch to boot ?

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

the italians are furious that france 's state-owned gaz de france has announced plans to merge with french energy group suez , making a takeover of that company by the italian rival enel much more difficult . " we are dealing with an extremely serious action by the french government which has used major financial resources to carry out a raid which goes against the free market , " said italy 's industry minister claudio scajola . on tuesday , italian economy minister giulo tremonti visits eu competition commissioner neelie kroes in an effort to get brussels to take action , since rome argues the takeover is being spurred on by the french government and violates eu competition rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin , center right , announces the merger between suez and gaz de france claudia kemfert , head of the department of energy , transportation and environment at the german institute of economic research , agreed with the italians that the case is about protective measures being taken by france . " france is pointedly trying to create a large company , " she said .
" but we want more competition on the european energy market . " violation of eu objectives on monday , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said that while the plan was apparently legal , it amounted to economic protectionism and violated the spirit of european objectives to create continent-wide energy groups . " france seems to have given a privilege to a national formula , " the commissioner told the corriere della sera daily .
" in the energy sector we say that there must be more european integration and then the french government puts the emphasis on the logic of national champions . " france has long had a policy of " economic patriotism , " as it calls it , insisting , however , that it is not protectionist . wolfgang pfaffenberger , head of the bremen energy institute , considers the intervention of the french government in the case as excessive . " the suez energy company is not only in france , but active on the international market , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to understand why an italian company should n't play a role on the french market . " many critics of france 's behavior point to the fact that while the country throws up walls around its companies , it is not reluctant about buying firms beyond its own borders . pfaffenberger cited the example of london , where electricity is supplied exclusively by electricité de france . " the english were n't exactly happy about that , but they allowed it , " he said .
" of the 12 energy distributors in england , about half are in foreign hands . " spain and germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain would rather e.on stay away while experts talk about " protectionism a la francais " in this case , france is not the only country which has experienced a bout of patriotism when it comes to its energy suppliers .
the spanish government is trying a bit of " la proteccion espanola " in working against the takeover of energy supplier endesa by düsseldorf-based e.on. spain wants endesa to stay in spanish hands . for diw 's kemfert , such measures are unfounded and make little sense . " it does n't matter which company is dominant in a country , " she said . liberalization slow going the path toward energy market liberalization in europe has been a rocky one .
in 1997 , the first european guidelines for an internal electricity market were established and in 1998 , a directive for the gas market followed .
but this month , the eu commission had to admit that its liberalization program was not proving to be in the best interests of the consumer in all cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french treasure kemfert said part of the reason that the process has been slower than , say , the telecommunications market is that investments needed tend to be capital intensive , since they involved more costly equipment , such as pipelines . some countries , however , have been more successful in privatizing their energy sectors , namely , england and scandinavia . " even before the eu guidelines were passed , there were well-functioning markets here with many smaller companies , " kemfert said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

the promises certainly sounded radical - a new system of " independent , self-governing state schools " to release " parent power " and local councils to switch from being " providers " of schools to mere " commissioners " of services .
the rhetoric was perhaps over-ripe - it alarmed labour mps into believing the comprehensive school system was under threat .
the genie of selection was out of the bottle and anyone familiar with the politics of education knows the trouble that causes .
limitations yet the detailed proposals hardly lived up to the rhetoric .
the freedoms of the planned trust schools were , it turned out , almost identical to those enjoyed by existing foundation and voluntary aided schools .
they could not become grammar schools , they could not select pupils by ability , and they would not get extra money .
the only real difference was the ability to form permanent relationships with other schools and outside partners , be they universities or charities .
the government 's aim was , fundamentally , to spread good management and practice from excellent schools to weak schools - it had little to do with selection .
concessions but it was too late - rebel mps doubted the government 's intentions .
backed by the education select committee they lobbied for changes .
some concessions were made .
the code of practice on admissions will be tightened up and schools will be banned from interviewing parents for admissions - even though hardly any do so .
these concessions were easily granted .
the only one that really hurt the government was the agreement that , in future , local councils could still open new community schools .
that went against the grain for ministers who wanted trust schools to be the one true way .
so the bill remains close to the spirit of the original white paper but still far short of the grander rhetoric that surrounded it .
why change ?
away from the political rows , the bill contains important and far-reaching changes - to discipline , school transport , and , most radical of all , encouraging a more personalised style of teaching and learning .
but on the key issue of trust schools , it now looks more like an evolutionary continuation of earlier reforms , rather than a revolutionary change of direction .
trust school status will remain voluntary , although weak schools will come under pressure to enter trusts .
the great majority of schools , though , argue they already have these freedoms and see no reason to change .
if the reforms do improve management at the bottom 10-15 % of schools the government can claim success , but this bill may leave most schools wondering what all the fuss was about .

in an interview with the bbc , mr nagin - who was criticised by some for his response to katrina - said he was " the only leader that has a plan that 's documented for bringing the city back " .
his comments came after a federal judge refused to postpone the 22 april mayoral poll , despite fears too many residents scattered by the disaster will be unable to vote .
some say the last thing new orleans needs right now is an election campaign , as the city struggles to recover from the massive flooding of six months ago .
i have the relationships from the white house down ray nagin polls were originally set for february , but state officials postponed them after katrina due to the devastation and confusion caused by the storm .
the mayor said he had put a " lot of blood sweat and tears into this " and if an election had to take place , he was ready .
" my message is one of honesty and integrity and reform - i have done that , demonstrated that , " he said .
" i was here during the storm , i was n't perfect but i did more things right than i did wrong .
" and then going forward i am the only leader that has a plan that 's documented for bringing the city back - and i have the relationships from the white house down , so i do n't see how anyone else is going to be able to top that . "
challengers last year mr nagin blasted the federal authorities for failing to respond fast enough to the devastation left by hurricane katrina .
ron forman enjoys wide support in new orleans yet he was criticised for failing to evacuate new orleans early enough , leaving thousands of poor citizens in the path of the storm .
as hurricane rita approached he was also attacked for rushing plans to reopen the city .
given new orleans ' problems , and the fact that the federal government holds the purse strings - and power - over the city 's recovery , it is a wonder anyone would want the job of mayor .
but mr nagin will be running against at least 10 challengers .
among the favourites are louisiana lieutenant governor mitch landrieu and ronald forman , head of the audubon nature institute , who has a lot of citywide support .
other hopefuls include the reverend tom watson , the only african american in the race besides mr nagin in a city that has not had a white mayor since 1978 .
nagin 's chocolate vision once a predominantly black city of about 462,000 people , new orleans now has a population of about 200,000 with a roughly equal number of white and black residents .
the city anticipates an influx of people over the summer , after the end of the school year .
but it is thought the current displacement of so many black voters will make the elections almost impossible to call .
mr nagin has been reaching out to african americans since his first election , where he was backed by the business establishment .
yet his controversial comments about making new orleans a " chocolate city " may have alienated some people .
mr nagin told the bbc he had been misconstrued .
" my vision of chocolate is that when i was a kid i was a big chocolate milk fan , " he said .
" so you take this dark syrup and mix it up with the white milk , and i could eat or drink both independently , but when i put them together it made something very special - now that is what i was referring to . "
' special place ' visions for the future of new orleans , currently a city of huge contrasts , will be one of the defining features of the election .
" this is a very special place , very unique .
that 's why people come from all over the world to visit us , " said mr nagin , speaking as the city prepared to celebrate the colourful climax of mardi gras .
" the parade rocks , " he said .
" things seem to be going very , very well from the perspective of what we expected . "
he added : " -lsb- new orleans -rsb- has a certain magnetism to it and what i am hearing from residents is , ' sure i was upset after katrina but now i am anxious to get back to my home which i am accustomed to . '
" it will have its soul .
one of our big challenges right now is to get our artists and musicians back .
we probably have about 20 % of them back - they are all anxious to come back , we just need to provide the housing and the outlets for them to do what they do . "

the study found almost 50 % of the biggest security breaches suffered by companies in the last two years were due to infection by malicious programs .
in some cases viruses crippled key systems such as e-mail for more than a day while companies cleaned up .
it also found that the worst outbreaks can take up to 50 days to fix .
threat profile the good news revealed by the survey was that the number of firms caught out by viruses had dropped by almost one-third since the last time the study was done in 2004 .
past viruses were designed to cause large amounts of indiscriminate damage typically by taking down targets ' networks .
today 's viruses have become more insidious chris potter , pricewaterhousecoopers this reduced infection rate was put down to the fact that most businesses now use anti-virus software to clean up e-mail traffic before it reaches in-boxes .
chris potter , a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers and one of the report 's authors , said firms had got much better at keeping their anti-virus software up to date and patching vulnerable systems .
but , he said , it was hard won experience .
" they know how much this can hurt if they get caught out . "
however , the survey found that firms that those who do get caught out tend to get infected far more often .
some unlucky companies said they were being infected once a day .
the report also highlighted the growing problem posed by spyware .
these malicious programs sneak on to pcs via several different routes and try to steal confidential information or use a hijacked machine as a launch pad for other activities .
almost 25 % of those surveyed said they had no defences in place to protect them against spyware .
as a result one in seven of the most serious incidents were caused by machines infected with spyware .
mr potter said companies needed to put defences in place to tackle newer threats .
he added that it can be hard to spot spyware as it can be bundled in with software , such as file-sharing programs , that users do want to get hold of .
" spyware may appear completely legitimate and may even have licence agreements you have to click on , " said mr potter .
" there 's a danger of fighting yesterday 's battle , " he said .
" past viruses were designed to cause large amounts of indiscriminate damage typically by taking down targets ' networks . "
" today 's viruses have become more insidious , " he said .
the dti survey questioned more than 1,000 businesses to find out how they coped with the escalating number of computer security threats .
the full results of the survey will be released at the infosecurity europe show to help at olympia in london from 25-27 april .

the study found almost 50 % of the biggest security breaches suffered by companies in the last two years were due to infection by malicious programs .
in some cases viruses crippled key systems such as e-mail for more than a day while companies cleaned up .
it also found that the worst outbreaks can take up to 50 days to fix .
threat profile the good news revealed by the survey was that the number of firms caught out by viruses had dropped by almost one-third since the last time the study was done in 2004 .
past viruses were designed to cause large amounts of indiscriminate damage typically by taking down targets ' networks .
today 's viruses have become more insidious chris potter , pricewaterhousecoopers this reduced infection rate was put down to the fact that most businesses now use anti-virus software to clean up e-mail traffic before it reaches in-boxes .
chris potter , a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers and one of the report 's authors , said firms had got much better at keeping their anti-virus software up to date and patching vulnerable systems .
but , he said , it was hard won experience .
" they know how much this can hurt if they get caught out . "
however , the survey found that firms that those who do get caught out tend to get infected far more often .
some unlucky companies said they were being infected once a day .
the report also highlighted the growing problem posed by spyware .
these malicious programs sneak on to pcs via several different routes and try to steal confidential information or use a hijacked machine as a launch pad for other activities .
almost 25 % of those surveyed said they had no defences in place to protect them against spyware .
as a result one in seven of the most serious incidents were caused by machines infected with spyware .
mr potter said companies needed to put defences in place to tackle newer threats .
he added that it can be hard to spot spyware as it can be bundled in with software , such as file-sharing programs , that users do want to get hold of .
" spyware may appear completely legitimate and may even have licence agreements you have to click on , " said mr potter .

both boys are 15 , blind and love their music , and they have met once before .
breakfast followed the boys as they were re-united earlier in the month and ibrahim shares his thoughts with us here : saturday : kyle 's arrival we really enjoyed welcoming our friends .
and kyle was really excited as this is his first taste of africa .
when they arrived we welcomed them with some african drums .
i was excited about him coming because when i visited him in england he treated me very well , like one of the family .
i remember that and will treat him very well too .
i thought they were going to be shy but they are very happy .
monday : school the art class is very interesting .
today we have been trying to put together a map of sierra leone which the uk children will take back with them .
we 've also looked at the map which they brought from england to sierra leone .
it is really good - we 've learned a lot of things .
the map is made up of different fabrics with things attached .
we could feel mountains , so we knew for example where scotland was .
for the sierra leone map we 're using cassava leaves , coconut leaves , bottle tops - many things .
tuesday : the choir competition today it was the local choir competition .
we did two song : evergreen - the westlife version - but actually it was written by will young .
world class visit " our friendship wo n't end until we die " ibrahim conti , sierra leone and we did an african song which was composed by the headmaster and the deputy .
we did that song very well i think .
and i think we sang more than we were singing before when we won the competition .
so i wonder why we did n't win this time .
but never mind we should accept defeat .
we did our best but the judges at the end were so harsh .
they were not able to give advice in a polite way .
instead they shouted at the competitors and were just very harsh .
and at the end the tower hill won .
but never mind .
we 've won the competition twice , this is the third time and we just missed it .
wednesday : school court this court is just for the students here at the school for the blind .
it was created by the deputy headmaster and the deputy , mr sam campbell and mr sandy .
it was created before most of us were here , back in the 70s .
they started the court because they wanted to put law and order back into tuition .
i think without that court most laws would have been disobeyed .
but with the help of the court , the laws are somehow doing well .
i was charged with being late for meal time and found guilty .
my punishment was to wash all the dishes on prize-giving day .
last thoughts our friendship wo n't end until we die .
i 've enjoyed it , we 've learned a lot and i 'll think about kyle a lot at class .
it does n't matter that we live far apart , our friendship will last .
and we 'll both try to do something better for the world .
we 're like brothers .

it was created by the deputy headmaster and the deputy , mr sam campbell and mr sandy .
it was created before most of us were here , back in the 70s .
they started the court because they wanted to put law and order back into tuition .
i think without that court most laws would have been disobeyed .
but with the help of the court , the laws are somehow doing well .
i was charged with being late for meal time and found guilty .
my punishment was to wash all the dishes on prize-giving day .
last thoughts our friendship wo n't end until we die .
i 've enjoyed it , we 've learned a lot and i 'll think about kyle a lot at class .
it does n't matter that we live far apart , our friendship will last .
and we 'll both try to do something better for the world .
we 're like brothers .

presenting the budget , mr chidambaram announced : defence spending up by 7 % to $ 20bn increased spending on rural infrastructure of $ 4.2bn a 31 % increase in spending on education an increase of 22 % on spending on health old age pension to be increased contracts to build five mega-power projects to be awarded by december he said india 's dominant farm sector was poised to grow as well .
" we shall not only achieve but exceed the target of farm production in three years , " he said .
india will also build 1,300km of " access-controlled " highways linking key cities , including mumbai and baroda , bangalore and madras and delhi and agra .
some 96 % of the golden quadrilateral , a major highway project connecting the four corners of india with the capital delhi , will be completed by the end of 2006 and the entire project by 2008 , he said .
tax relief the finance minister said no new taxes will be introduced .
he announced : no change in personal or corporate tax rates duty cuts on small cars to 16 % 5 % increase in duty on cigarettes mr chidambaram also announced a decrease in peak tariff rates for non-agricultural products to 15 % .
" we are now a short distance away from east asian rates , " he said .

mayor brian chaplin and council leader andrew mckinley both claim rights to a specific slot behind the building .
mr chaplin says it is dedicated for the mayor but mr mckinley says recent changes means any councillor with a permit can park there .
the mayor has a space in the front of the offices for the official car .
the cabinet will debate the row on tuesday .
a statement from councillor john morris , the cabinet member who covers parking , said the mayor did have spaces both at the front and rear of the building until 1 february .
' bully-boy tactics ' but changes were agreed in september 2005 to " bring the parking into line with the council 's green transport policy " .
an annual charge of £ 52 was brought in for all councillors wanting to use the designated car park .
" this was effective as of 22 february 2006 and the spaces at the back of the municipal offices will be available to councillors who have paid on a first come first serve basis , " mr morris said .
but mr chaplin said he needed both spaces for his civic duties and opposed the charge which he claims is still a proposal and not set in stone .
" it certainly has n't been approved as far as i know by any official committee or the cabinet and it 's just , in my view , bully boy tactics . "

it will be seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world , in almost every country .
the man at the helm , albeit unseen by viewers , will be the director , louis j horvitz .
" it 's my job to show them everything that 's happening here at the kodak theatre on the stage , " he says .
" i make it a point to not editorialise but to just go ahead and show as much as i possibly can . "
it is mr horvitz 's 10th year in the hot seat .
he has made a career out of directing awards show .
previous high-profile assignments include the daytime emmy awards , the mtv movie awards and the kids choice awards .
" i think the highest honour is to be asked to direct the academy awards , " he says .
" there are many great shows that i direct but as a live gigantic event the academy awards has that appeal .
it 's the super bowl of the award genre . "
while the oscars ceremony is the granddaddy of all awards shows , it also tends to be the most formal in its style of presentation .
it is drummed in to celebrities who take it in turn to hand out the awards , that they should not deviate from their script .
a team of writers , overseen by the academy , pens every word .
the winners are told to keep their acceptance speeches brief and , preferably , interesting .
" i always say to people : ' i need to remind you now this is live television .
it 's not good to make the live television director unhappy ' , " says mr horvitz .
" clearly , our objective is not just to make the show fast , it 's to give the viewing audience the best of that evening . "
a " very poignant or meaningful moment " is allowed to hang in the air - but mr horvitz says overly long acceptance speeches can expect to be drowned out by the orchestra .
with audience figures for awards ceremonies dropping in recent years , the show 's producers face a constant challenge to keep viewers from drifting away .
" it 's just hard today to get people to pay attention , " he says .
" i 'm certain that the viewing individual today , while they 're watching the academy awards , they 're online and probably watching oscars.org and they 're also watching a car race or they 're playing with their kids .
" everyone is in a multi-task mode so the amount of attention span has dwindled down to not too long . "
the challenge this year is to capture the imagination of a tv audience , many of whom will not have seen the main nominated movies .
director 's challenge with the field dominated by low-budget , independent pictures , viewers may be less tempted to tune in than in a year when the buzz is about the lord of the rings or titanic .
" the challenge certainly is to make sure the people at home see as many stars as possible to keep them tuned in , " mr horvitz says .
" in a way , show them clips of these movies so that they may go out and experience the best of the 78th annual oscars . "
within hollywood circles , there is nothing bigger than the academy awards .
the prestige of winning is attached to an actor for life .
" if you were to go and ask an actor : ' i 'll trade you three golden globes , a screen actors guild award and god knows what else kind of award for your work , for one oscar , you 'll have no actor give up an oscar , " says mr horvitz .
" each year i never take for granted being asked back by the academy .
every year i get a drive in a formula one car and the year that i do n't is going to be disappointing . "

louis j horvitz says directing the oscars is the " highest honour " " it 's my job to show them everything that 's happening here at the kodak theatre on the stage , " he says .
" i make it a point to not editorialise but to just go ahead and show as much as i possibly can . "

he has made a career out of directing awards show .
previous high-profile assignments include the daytime emmy awards , the mtv movie awards and the kids choice awards .

a team of writers , overseen by the academy , pens every word .
the winners are told to keep their acceptance speeches brief and , preferably , interesting .
" i always say to people : ' i need to remind you now this is live television .

it will be seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world , in almost every country .
the man at the helm , albeit unseen by viewers , will be the director , louis j horvitz .
louis j horvitz says directing the oscars is the " highest honour " " it 's my job to show them everything that 's happening here at the kodak theatre on the stage , " he says .
" i make it a point to not editorialise but to just go ahead and show as much as i possibly can . "
it is mr horvitz 's 10th year in the hot seat .
he has made a career out of directing awards show .
previous high-profile assignments include the daytime emmy awards , the mtv movie awards and the kids choice awards .
" i think the highest honour is to be asked to direct the academy awards , " he says .
" there are many great shows that i direct but as a live gigantic event the academy awards has that appeal .
it 's the super bowl of the award genre . "
brokeback mountain is tipped to do well at the oscars while the oscars ceremony is the granddaddy of all awards shows , it also tends to be the most formal in its style of presentation .
it is drummed in to celebrities who take it in turn to hand out the awards , that they should not deviate from their script .
a team of writers , overseen by the academy , pens every word .
the winners are told to keep their acceptance speeches brief and , preferably , interesting .
" i always say to people : ' i need to remind you now this is live television .
it 's not good to make the live television director unhappy ' , " says mr horvitz .
" clearly , our objective is not just to make the show fast , it 's to give the viewing audience the best of that evening . "
a " very poignant or meaningful moment " is allowed to hang in the air - but mr horvitz says overly long acceptance speeches can expect to be drowned out by the orchestra .
comic chris rock hosted last year 's ceremony with audience figures for awards ceremonies dropping in recent years , the show 's producers face a constant challenge to keep viewers from drifting away .
" it 's just hard today to get people to pay attention , " he says .
" i 'm certain that the viewing individual today , while they 're watching the academy awards , they 're online and probably watching oscars.org and they 're also watching a car race or they 're playing with their kids .
" everyone is in a multi-task mode so the amount of attention span has dwindled down to not too long . "
the challenge this year is to capture the imagination of a tv audience , many of whom will not have seen the main nominated movies .
director 's challenge with the field dominated by low-budget , independent pictures , viewers may be less tempted to tune in than in a year when the buzz is about the lord of the rings or titanic .
" the challenge certainly is to make sure the people at home see as many stars as possible to keep them tuned in , " mr horvitz says .
" in a way , show them clips of these movies so that they may go out and experience the best of the 78th annual oscars . "
within hollywood circles , there is nothing bigger than the academy awards .
the prestige of winning is attached to an actor for life .
" if you were to go and ask an actor : ' i 'll trade you three golden globes , a screen actors guild award and god knows what else kind of award for your work , for one oscar , you 'll have no actor give up an oscar , " says mr horvitz .
" each year i never take for granted being asked back by the academy .
every year i get a drive in a formula one car and the year that i do n't is going to be disappointing . "

he is returning to mastermind sunday 's event for a 13th time .
" there 's nothing like a live television show , " he says .
" the fact that this is essentially a news programme - it 's three-and-a-half hours of people watching the show to find out who gets these awards - is very satisfying . "
while the format remains essentially the same , each show takes on a character of its own .
there have been occasions when the mood was decidedly sombre - the most recent being when america and its allies were at war with iraq .
" each oscars show really has a different flavour and a different feeling to it - depending on the films that have been nominated and depending on what 's going on in the world at the time , " says mr cates .
we try to get a great host , we try to have wonderful presenters on the show , we try to do musical numbers that will entice and enthrall gil cates " this is a very , very interesting year .
it 's a special year with special films . "
low profile films like capote , good night , and good luck and crash may well be special , but relatively few people have seen them .
in box office terms , they are not in the same league as some of the oscars better-known champions .
mr cates is well aware that the list of low profile nominees is likely to have an impact on the viewing audience for the oscars .
" obviously , when we have a film like titanic , which many people saw two and three times - we had a very large rating .
one year the english patient was one of the nominees and the audience faltered , " he says .
the producer 's job is to build a show that appeals to a wide cross-section of the potential audience .
" we try to get a great host , we try to have wonderful presenters on the show , we try to do musical numbers that will entice and enthrall and in general we try to book the show in a way that will encourage the largest number of people possible to watch it . "
jon stewart , this year 's host , is less well known than his predecessors .
but as the presenter of the daily show , a hugely successful comedy show on cable tv , he has a cult following .
us comedian jon stewart will host this year 's ceremony " jon stewart is a super host for us this year because he 's very politically adept - he 's culturally aware , he 's a very smart man .
we need someone who is not only a stand-up comic who can really work a room and deal with the unexpected . "
but , according to mr cates , the onus is on everyone involved in the show to make it a success .
he has a particular dislike of presenters that take to the stage and make unscripted comments .
" for a presenter to go out and say something that was not predetermined shows a substantial lack of faith and is a terrible thing to do .
" i would respond very hostilely to that .
however a nominee who wins an academy award - that 's his or her 30 or 40 seconds in the sun .
" i tell them that i would hope that they would talk about what the oscar means to them or something that 's significant in terms of their lives , but if they elect to say something political it 's a free country and they 're entitled to do it . "
magic the show will also feature what the producer describes as an " educational component " .
the academy awards have always attempted to highlight some of the lesser-known facts about film-making .
" in the show this year we have a two sentence explanation of what sound effects editing is , and i would wager that 95 % of the audience has no clue what sound effects editing is , " says mr cates .
" there 's a big kick that i get out of having stuff on the show that makes people say , ' wow , i did n't know that before ' . "
at the end of a long hollywood ' awards season ' , the oscars are seen as the grand finale , the jewel in the crown .
but after weeks of self-congratulatory ceremonies there is a sense that they rather steal the thunder of the academy awards .
" i think there are too many awards shows , " says mr cates .
but he adds : " it 's obviously self-serving of me to say that but i think it 's a free country and people can give awards to their hearts ' content .
the truth of the matter is the oscars have been with us for 78 years .

by adam brimelow bbc news health correspondent spending on the nhs in england has more than doubled since labour came to power .
but with parts of the service in financial crisis , attention has focussed on how well the money is being used .
the key question is : are we getting value for money ?
over the last 18 months or so health economists have been trying to work out a meaningful way of measuring productivity that includes the quality , rather than just the quantity , of its services .
this week the office for national statistics presented a progress report .
it concluded that by most assessments productivity is stagnant or even falling , but it accepts that the figures need refining .
fast track at the cardiac unit in the royal brompton hospital in london patients listed for operations are put through a " fit for surgery " assessment . "
if we can really concentrate on helping them manage their own conditions , we may be able to prevent the deterioration of their condition " nigel edwards those who are fit enough are put on a fast track scheme to get them home soon after surgery .
it is an example of what the government calls the " productivity pot of gold " in the nhs , freeing up bed space , cutting cancellations and saving money .
alvin robins , who 's expecting his heart by pass operation next month , is pleased to be on the scheme .
" it gets me out of the way so that they can use my bed for someone else who needs it maybe more urgently .
" i can see that it 's saving them money .
it also gives me confidence that they think i 'm well enough to receive this sort of treatment .
" therefore it gives me confidence that my recovery should be fairly quick . "
with a quarter of trusts in deficit the need to improve productivity has never been more urgent .
but how do you measure productivity in an organisation as complex as the nhs ?
crude measures until now it has been a relatively crude exercise , dividing outputs -lrb- such as operations , prescriptions or ambulance trips -rrb- by inputs -lrb- the resources put in -rrb- .
the ons calculates that on this basis productivity in the health service has been falling for the past decade , by between 0.6 % and 1.3 % a year .
but its executive director joe grice says these figures - drawn from the national accounts - do n't tell the full story . "
we simply do not have a proper measure of the impact that a hospital will have on somebody 's health " professor john appleby " the national accounts are a very broad brush measure of performance .
" and we are aware that the figures in the national accounts - the methodology we use - does n't take any account of quality change .
" and accounting for that quality change is clearly very important to patients certainly and indeed to us as taxpayers as the providers of those services . "
the ons is playing it safe .
alongside its verdict of falling productivity in the nhs , it 's presented another that says it is stable , and a third that says it is improving .
the latter two take in tests of quality , such as survival rates and waiting times .
but there is another factor included in the third verdict - taking it into positive territory .
this gives weight to an increased value of health in a more prosperous society - such as the loss of higher earnings if you are sick .
national debate the ons now wants a national debate to decide on the best approach .
it admits that a priority for the future must be better information on primary care .
nigel edwards from the nhs confederation , which speaks for health trusts , says the focus should be on patients with long-term conditions such as asthma or diabetes .
" if we can really concentrate on helping them manage their own conditions , support them with specialist nurses or other specialist staff in the community , we may be able to prevent the deterioration of their condition or acute exacerbations which require them to go into hospital .
" incidentally that would count as a loss of productivity in the way that we currently measure it but obviously it 's a much better use of resources .
" it may be cheaper but it 's certainly better for the patient . "
on the treadmill at his local gym in east london , bert duffus has taken this approach one step further .
like his father and uncle before him , he has developed diabetes .
patient power but he is part of the nhs " expert patient " programme , managing the condition largely by himself .
and through diet and exercise , he 's avoided the need for prescriptions .
" i did n't want to go and see my gp every few weeks to get new medication and new tablets .
" because there 's all sorts of medication coming in and you do n't know the side effects .
i did n't want to be dependent on medication to control my life .
" i want to control my own life my own way .
i know eventually i probably will go on medication but at forty nine i 'm too young . "
the ons says it is unlikely that a single number for productivity will ever capture all the costs and benefits of the nhs .
but it wants to develop a more sophisticated and accurate measure .
professor john appleby from the health research group the king 's fund says emphasis should be given to asking patients " are you healthier ? " .
it is already happening in the private sector and at some independent treatment centres .
key information professor appleby says it could help to deliver a useful measure of productivity in the health service , and would also inform patient choice .
" the crucial bit of information that patients really want in order to make their choices is what is the impact on their health going to be of going to hospital a or hospital b.
" the trouble is we do n't produce that kind of information in the health service .
" we simply do not have a proper measure of the impact that a hospital will have on somebody 's health . "
clearly there 's a long way to go on this , but the intention is to arrive at a consensus - after consultation - on how to measure productivity in the health service .
but the issue is so politically fraught - that this aspiration may prove to be hopelessly optimistic .

by adam brimelow bbc news health correspondent spending on the nhs in england has more than doubled since labour came to power .
but with parts of the service in financial crisis , attention has focussed on how well the money is being used .
the key question is : are we getting value for money ?
over the last 18 months or so health economists have been trying to work out a meaningful way of measuring productivity that includes the quality , rather than just the quantity , of its services .
this week the office for national statistics presented a progress report .
it concluded that by most assessments productivity is stagnant or even falling , but it accepts that the figures need refining .
fast track at the cardiac unit in the royal brompton hospital in london patients listed for operations are put through a " fit for surgery " assessment .
if we can really concentrate on helping them manage their own conditions , we may be able to prevent the deterioration of their condition nigel edwards those who are fit enough are put on a fast track scheme to get them home soon after surgery .
it is an example of what the government calls the " productivity pot of gold " in the nhs , freeing up bed space , cutting cancellations and saving money .
alvin robins , who 's expecting his heart by pass operation next month , is pleased to be on the scheme .
" it gets me out of the way so that they can use my bed for someone else who needs it maybe more urgently .
" i can see that it 's saving them money .
it also gives me confidence that they think i 'm well enough to receive this sort of treatment .
" therefore it gives me confidence that my recovery should be fairly quick . "
with a quarter of trusts in deficit the need to improve productivity has never been more urgent .
but how do you measure productivity in an organisation as complex as the nhs ?
crude measures until now it has been a relatively crude exercise , dividing outputs -lrb- such as operations , prescriptions or ambulance trips -rrb- by inputs -lrb- the resources put in -rrb- .
the ons calculates that on this basis productivity in the health service has been falling for the past decade , by between 0.6 % and 1.3 % a year .
but its executive director joe grice says these figures - drawn from the national accounts - do n't tell the full story .
we simply do not have a proper measure of the impact that a hospital will have on somebody 's health professor john appleby " the national accounts are a very broad brush measure of performance .
" and we are aware that the figures in the national accounts - the methodology we use - does n't take any account of quality change .
" and accounting for that quality change is clearly very important to patients certainly and indeed to us as taxpayers as the providers of those services . "
the ons is playing it safe .
alongside its verdict of falling productivity in the nhs , it 's presented another that says it is stable , and a third that says it is improving .
the latter two take in tests of quality , such as survival rates and waiting times .
but there is another factor included in the third verdict - taking it into positive territory .
this gives weight to an increased value of health in a more prosperous society - such as the loss of higher earnings if you are sick .
national debate the ons now wants a national debate to decide on the best approach .
it admits that a priority for the future must be better information on primary care .
nigel edwards from the nhs confederation , which speaks for health trusts , says the focus should be on patients with long-term conditions such as asthma or diabetes .
" if we can really concentrate on helping them manage their own conditions , support them with specialist nurses or other specialist staff in the community , we may be able to prevent the deterioration of their condition or acute exacerbations which require them to go into hospital .

a strong society , where our families , our communities and our nation create secure foundations on which people can build their lives .
a sustainable environment , where we enhance the beauty of our surroundings and protect the future of the planet .
our values : the more we trust people , the stronger they and society become .
we 're all in this together - government , business , the voluntary sector , families and individuals .
we have a shared responsibility for our shared future .
our party : we are an open and inclusive party .
we will act to ensure that our party , at every level , is representative of modern britain .
what we 're fighting for : 1 .
a successful britain must be able to compete with the world .
we will put economic stability and fiscal responsibility first .
they must come before tax cuts .
over time , we will share the proceeds of growth between public services and lower taxes - instead of letting government spend an ever-increasing share of national income .
2 .
there is such a thing as society , it 's just not the same thing as the state .
the right test for our policies is how they help the most disadvantaged in society , not the rich .
we will stand up for the victims of state failure and ensure that social justice and equal opportunity are achieved by empowering people and communities - instead of thinking that only the state can guarantee fairness .
3 .
the quality of life matters , as well as the quantity of money .
we will enhance our environment by seeking a long-term cross-party consensus on sustainable development and climate change - instead of short-term thinking and surrender to vested interests .
we will support the choices that women make about their work and home lives , not impose choices on them .
4 .
public services for everyone must be guaranteed by the state , not necessarily run by the state .
we will improve the nhs and schools for everyone , not help a few to opt out .
but public services paid for by the state do n't have to be run by the state .
we will trust professionals and share responsibility - instead of controlling professionals in state monopolies .
5 .
it is our moral obligation to make poverty history .
we will fight for free and fair trade , increase international aid , and press for further debt relief .
but this is not enough .
we will also take action to build those institutions - like the rule of law and property rights - that support development .
6 .
security and freedom must go hand in hand .
in fighting crime and terrorism , we will be hard-nosed defenders of freedom and security .
we will ensure strong defence and the effective enforcement of laws that balance liberty and safety - instead of ineffective authoritarianism which puts both freedom and security at risk .
7 .
we understand the limitations of government , but are not limited in our aspirations for government .
we believe in the role of government as a force for good .
it can and should support aspirations such as home ownership , saving for a pension , and starting a business .
it should support families and marriage , and those who care for others .
and it should support the shared experiences that bring us together - such as sport , the arts and culture .
