there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .
the munich-based prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , said more information was necessary before legal action could begin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia agents allegedly relaxed on mallorca between flights but many journalists wonder why it is taking prosecutors to find out more about el-masri 's case .
in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue . " if the suspects involved were from libya , then prosecutors would have ordered their arrest a long time ago , " green party politician hans-christian ströbele told the paper . spanish police discovered the names of the suspects in spring 2005 .
a spanish journalist passed on the information to el-masri 's attorney , gnjidic , who turned the list over to german prosecutors in december 2005 , the süddeutsche zeitung reported . transatlantic tensions el-masri 's case has sparked diplomatic tension between washington and berlin . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this year that the united states had admitted making a mistake in detaining lebanese-born el-masri . the case heightened the controversy about the cia 's so-called rendition program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to secret prisons in other countries for questioning . us president george w. bush admitted earlier this month that the cia had covertly held prisoners in overseas prisons . el-masri sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trail could compromise us security by disclosing secret information but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .

he made his comments in thursday 's issue of die zeit weekly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etching from the collection : death and the sleeping woman despite world-wide praise heaped on the newly reopened grünes gewölbe -lrb- green vault -rrb- gallery , the capital of saxony can hardly keep its museums running , roth wrote .
at the opening of the famed green vault , roth noted , saxony 's prime minister , georg milbradt , compared dresden 's museum treasures to the louvre in paris and the metropolitan museum of art in new york . but , roth noted , the louvre has 2,000 employees and the met has 2,500 , whereas dresden will need to reduce its personnel from 450 down to 259 due to budget restrictions . " it has long been impossible to run the museums in any normal way .
we can only race , panting , through our days , " roth wrote in die zeit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic green vault is known for its treasure chamber " every year the state finance minister expects more profit , and museum subsidies are cut deeply , " he wrote .
as a result , he said , the successful series of museum exhibits that showed off the treasures of dresden in metropolises like paris , moscow , new york , london and rome , can not continue . roth also said that the state seems only capable of funding new museums or expanding them , not running them , adding that the current finance ministry shows " mainly destructiveness or ignorance " when it comes to aesthetics . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden treasury reopens six decades after allied bombings the restored green vault at dresden 's royal palace , one of germany 's most celebrated museums , was unveiled more than 60 years after world war ii bombs reduced it to rubble .

" continuing industrialization challenges with the wiring of production aircraft have been identified and are being tackled , " airbus parent company eads said in a statement thursday .
" consequently , from what is known today , there will be further delays .

" we 're not going to stop until the whole of the european union provides an answer , because an answer is needed , " he said , adding that italy and malta were also affected .

dw-world.de readers comment on the recent success of germany 's far right npd party in state elections .
most seem to think that the party should not be banned from participating in future polls . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . sixty years may have passed , but it 's still too soon for germany to the allow right wing extremists to have a hand in governing . - dave wells , us when the mainstream parties do not represent an area properly , the people look elsewhere . - alfred mari n , ca n ada it appears that the lessons of the past might be forgotten by some , but not the far-right npd leadership , who are feeding on the feelings of the " angry young german in the streets . "
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

dw-world.de readers comment on the recent success of germany 's far right npd party in state elections .
most seem to think that the party should not be banned from participating in future polls . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . sixty years may have passed , but it 's still too soon for germany to the allow right wing extremists to have a hand in governing . - dave wells , us when the mainstream parties do not represent an area properly , the people look elsewhere . - alfred mari n , ca n ada it appears that the lessons of the past might be forgotten by some , but not the far-right npd leadership , who are feeding on the feelings of the " angry young german in the streets . "
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

with the motto " fairness for the döner " producers are doing their best to restore their image . despite the recent rotten meat scandal , chancellor angela merkel said last week that she will enjoy an occasional dö n er , the turkish lamb sandwich that can be found at fast-food stands on practically every corner in german cities . many other fans of the turkish delicacy are back to doing the same . although döner consumption had dropped by as much as 50 percent in some places in germany following the meat scandal , revenue has nearly boomeranged back to where it was before , said remzi kaplan from the association of turkish döner producers in europe . i n te n sive quality assura n ce process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a döner is usually made with lamb , though other varieties are available " we have sufficient monitoring , " said kaplan , whose döner business has annually received awards for quality since 2004m , at a berlin press conference under the motto " fairness for the döner . " " anyone can come to our company anytime and see how the döners are produced , " he added . with regular microbiological trend analyses , germ and odor checks and temperature measurements , döner producers are bound to the hygiene and health standards set by the european union . tests are conducted throughout the entire process , from the arrival of the raw meat to the production and delivery of the döner skewer .
each skewer is also marked with a unique serial number so that it can be traced back from the retailer to the producer , if necessary . " warehouses are weakest li n k " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remzi kaplan and his daughter shook their hips at a party in his berlin restaurant during the recent series of police checks , some rancid meat was discovered at döner stands , but cedar coskun , a quality assurance advisory for the döner industry , said the producers of the giant lamb skewers were not to blame . " as far as rotten meat is concerned , the weakest link in the chain is the mass warehouses , " coskun said .
" they 're the ones that store tons of meat over several years . " even if the recent affair is not exclusively a döner scandal , the industry is n't totally off the hook . of the 12,000 döner stands in germany , around 1,000 sell their wares at dumping prices .
to offer a döner for 79 or 99 euro cents -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.20 -rrb- , quality has to suffer , said kaplan , berlin 's largest döner producer . mi n imum price proposed kaplan 's co-worker sir atesever has advocated a minimum price of three euros per döner as a means of insuring quality ingredients . mehmet cam , deputy chairman of the society of turkish producers in europe , said he supports banning from the business altogether producers that infringe on quality standards . " the names of those food establishments that do n't follow the regulations - not only in the döner branch but in general - should be made public , " cam said .
" it should be very strict . " as a consequence of the meat scandal , the german ministry of economics is currently preparing a law that would prohibit the sale of food products under the acquisition price . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de official : meat scandal thus far " tip of the iceberg " the spoiled meat found in the current scandal plaguing the german meat industry is just " the tip of the iceberg , " according to the the federation of german food and drink industries .

some german politicians , however , feel help is n't necessary . meeting with his eu counterparts in finland , spanish justice minister juan fernando lopez aguilar said that his country was urging other bloc members to show more solidarity with those states responsible for securing the union 's external borders . " we 're not going to stop until the whole of the european union provides an answer , because an answer is needed , " he said , adding that italy and malta were also affected . " we come here , not to ask for help but to push for the proper help that is needed , not only for spain but for the rest of the european member states which are the southern frontier of the european union , " he said . when asked what he thought was needed , lopez aguilar said : " money , resources , means , determination and the consciousnesses that this is not a simple contingency , this is a reality which is going to accompany all of us along the way in the first third of the 21st century . " germa n y n ot so happy the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has been virtually powerless to deal with the problem , apart from providing funds , and has implored the bloc 's 25 member countries to show more solidarity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from africa die during dangerous journeys to spain politicians in germany , however , are not pleased with the notion of the eu helping spain out in dealing with its illegal immigrants .

dw-world.de readers comment on the recent success of germany 's far right npd party in state elections .
most seem to think that the party should not be banned from participating in future polls . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . sixty years may have passed , but it 's still too soon for germany to the allow right wing extremists to have a hand in governing . - dave wells , us when the mainstream parties do not represent an area properly , the people look elsewhere . - alfred mari n , ca n ada it appears that the lessons of the past might be forgotten by some , but not the far-right npd leadership , who are feeding on the feelings of the " angry young german in the streets . "
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .

in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue . " if the suspects involved were from libya , then prosecutors would have ordered their arrest a long time ago , " green party politician hans-christian ströbele told the paper . spanish police discovered the names of the suspects in spring 2005 .
a spanish journalist passed on the information to el-masri 's attorney , gnjidic , who turned the list over to german prosecutors in december 2005 , the süddeutsche zeitung reported . transatlantic tensions el-masri 's case has sparked diplomatic tension between washington and berlin . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this year that the united states had admitted making a mistake in detaining lebanese-born el-masri . the case heightened the controversy about the cia 's so-called rendition program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to secret prisons in other countries for questioning . us president george w. bush admitted earlier this month that the cia had covertly held prisoners in overseas prisons . el-masri sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trail could compromise us security by disclosing secret information but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

he made his comments in thursday 's issue of die zeit weekly .

at the opening of the famed green vault , roth noted , saxony 's prime minister , georg milbradt , compared dresden 's museum treasures to the louvre in paris and the metropolitan museum of art in new york . but , roth noted , the louvre has 2,000 employees and the met has 2,500 , whereas dresden will need to reduce its personnel from 450 down to 259 due to budget restrictions . " it has long been impossible to run the museums in any normal way .
we can only race , panting , through our days , " roth wrote in die zeit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic green vault is known for its treasure chamber " every year the state finance minister expects more profit , and museum subsidies are cut deeply , " he wrote .
as a result , he said , the successful series of museum exhibits that showed off the treasures of dresden in metropolises like paris , moscow , new york , london and rome , can not continue . roth also said that the state seems only capable of funding new museums or expanding them , not running them , adding that the current finance ministry shows " mainly destructiveness or ignorance " when it comes to aesthetics . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden treasury reopens six decades after allied bombings the restored green vault at dresden 's royal palace , one of germany 's most celebrated museums , was unveiled more than 60 years after world war ii bombs reduced it to rubble .

dw-world.de readers comment on the recent success of germany 's far right npd party in state elections .
most seem to think that the party should not be banned from participating in future polls . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . sixty years may have passed , but it 's still too soon for germany to the allow right wing extremists to have a hand in governing . - dave wells , us when the mainstream parties do not represent an area properly , the people look elsewhere . - alfred mari n , ca n ada it appears that the lessons of the past might be forgotten by some , but not the far-right npd leadership , who are feeding on the feelings of the " angry young german in the streets . "
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .
the munich-based prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , said more information was necessary before legal action could begin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia agents allegedly relaxed on mallorca between flights but many journalists wonder why it is taking prosecutors to find out more about el-masri 's case .
in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue . " if the suspects involved were from libya , then prosecutors would have ordered their arrest a long time ago , " green party politician hans-christian ströbele told the paper . spanish police discovered the names of the suspects in spring 2005 .
a spanish journalist passed on the information to el-masri 's attorney , gnjidic , who turned the list over to german prosecutors in december 2005 , the süddeutsche zeitung reported . transatlantic tensions el-masri 's case has sparked diplomatic tension between washington and berlin . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this year that the united states had admitted making a mistake in detaining lebanese-born el-masri . the case heightened the controversy about the cia 's so-called rendition program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to secret prisons in other countries for questioning . us president george w. bush admitted earlier this month that the cia had covertly held prisoners in overseas prisons . el-masri sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trail could compromise us security by disclosing secret information but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .
the munich-based prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , said more information was necessary before legal action could begin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia agents allegedly relaxed on mallorca between flights but many journalists wonder why it is taking prosecutors to find out more about el-masri 's case .
in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue . " if the suspects involved were from libya , then prosecutors would have ordered their arrest a long time ago , " green party politician hans-christian ströbele told the paper . spanish police discovered the names of the suspects in spring 2005 .
a spanish journalist passed on the information to el-masri 's attorney , gnjidic , who turned the list over to german prosecutors in december 2005 , the süddeutsche zeitung reported . transatlantic tensions el-masri 's case has sparked diplomatic tension between washington and berlin . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this year that the united states had admitted making a mistake in detaining lebanese-born el-masri . the case heightened the controversy about the cia 's so-called rendition program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to secret prisons in other countries for questioning . us president george w. bush admitted earlier this month that the cia had covertly held prisoners in overseas prisons . el-masri sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trail could compromise us security by disclosing secret information but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

some german politicians , however , feel help is n't necessary . meeting with his eu counterparts in finland , spanish justice minister juan fernando lopez aguilar said that his country was urging other bloc members to show more solidarity with those states responsible for securing the union 's external borders . " we 're not going to stop until the whole of the european union provides an answer , because an answer is needed , " he said , adding that italy and malta were also affected . " we come here , not to ask for help but to push for the proper help that is needed , not only for spain but for the rest of the european member states which are the southern frontier of the european union , " he said . when asked what he thought was needed , lopez aguilar said : " money , resources , means , determination and the consciousnesses that this is not a simple contingency , this is a reality which is going to accompany all of us along the way in the first third of the 21st century .

dw-world.de readers comment on the recent success of germany 's far right npd party in state elections .
most seem to think that the party should not be banned from participating in future polls . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . sixty years may have passed , but it 's still too soon for germany to the allow right wing extremists to have a hand in governing . - dave wells , us when the mainstream parties do not represent an area properly , the people look elsewhere . - alfred mari n , ca n ada it appears that the lessons of the past might be forgotten by some , but not the far-right npd leadership , who are feeding on the feelings of the " angry young german in the streets . "
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

some german politicians , however , feel help is n't necessary . meeting with his eu counterparts in finland , spanish justice minister juan fernando lopez aguilar said that his country was urging other bloc members to show more solidarity with those states responsible for securing the union 's external borders . " we 're not going to stop until the whole of the european union provides an answer , because an answer is needed , " he said , adding that italy and malta were also affected . " we come here , not to ask for help but to push for the proper help that is needed , not only for spain but for the rest of the european member states which are the southern frontier of the european union , " he said . when asked what he thought was needed , lopez aguilar said : " money , resources , means , determination and the consciousnesses that this is not a simple contingency , this is a reality which is going to accompany all of us along the way in the first third of the 21st century . " germa n y n ot so happy the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has been virtually powerless to deal with the problem , apart from providing funds , and has implored the bloc 's 25 member countries to show more solidarity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from africa die during dangerous journeys to spain politicians in germany , however , are not pleased with the notion of the eu helping spain out in dealing with its illegal immigrants .

there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .
the munich-based prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , said more information was necessary before legal action could begin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia agents allegedly relaxed on mallorca between flights but many journalists wonder why it is taking prosecutors to find out more about el-masri 's case .
in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue . " if the suspects involved were from libya , then prosecutors would have ordered their arrest a long time ago , " green party politician hans-christian ströbele told the paper . spanish police discovered the names of the suspects in spring 2005 .
a spanish journalist passed on the information to el-masri 's attorney , gnjidic , who turned the list over to german prosecutors in december 2005 , the süddeutsche zeitung reported . transatlantic tensions el-masri 's case has sparked diplomatic tension between washington and berlin . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this year that the united states had admitted making a mistake in detaining lebanese-born el-masri . the case heightened the controversy about the cia 's so-called rendition program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to secret prisons in other countries for questioning . us president george w. bush admitted earlier this month that the cia had covertly held prisoners in overseas prisons . el-masri sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trail could compromise us security by disclosing secret information but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

dw-world.de readers comment on the recent success of germany 's far right npd party in state elections .
most seem to think that the party should not be banned from participating in future polls . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . sixty years may have passed , but it 's still too soon for germany to the allow right wing extremists to have a hand in governing . - dave wells , us when the mainstream parties do not represent an area properly , the people look elsewhere . - alfred mari n , ca n ada it appears that the lessons of the past might be forgotten by some , but not the far-right npd leadership , who are feeding on the feelings of the " angry young german in the streets . "
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .
the munich-based prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , said more information was necessary before legal action could begin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia agents allegedly relaxed on mallorca between flights but many journalists wonder why it is taking prosecutors to find out more about el-masri 's case .
in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue .

dw-world.de readers comment on the recent success of germany 's far right npd party in state elections .
most seem to think that the party should not be banned from participating in future polls . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . sixty years may have passed , but it 's still too soon for germany to the allow right wing extremists to have a hand in governing . - dave wells , us when the mainstream parties do not represent an area properly , the people look elsewhere . - alfred mari n , ca n ada it appears that the lessons of the past might be forgotten by some , but not the far-right npd leadership , who are feeding on the feelings of the " angry young german in the streets . "
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?

"
the alarming and cancerous high rate of unemployment in the new federal states is feeding a hungry and rapid growing movement among young people throughout germany toward the rebirth of 21st century nazism .
a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .

a " public uprising " among the public and media is fully justified now to thwart further growth least we suffer the lessons of the past .
the german press and responsible german voters must take action now to force an initiative to achieve a constitutional amendment - one which outlaws radical parties from gaining parliamentary recognition in the german government .
the entire world is watching to see what the next move is .
i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

he made his comments in thursday 's issue of die zeit weekly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : etching from the collection : death and the sleeping woman despite world-wide praise heaped on the newly reopened grünes gewölbe -lrb- green vault -rrb- gallery , the capital of saxony can hardly keep its museums running , roth wrote .
at the opening of the famed green vault , roth noted , saxony 's prime minister , georg milbradt , compared dresden 's museum treasures to the louvre in paris and the metropolitan museum of art in new york . but , roth noted , the louvre has 2,000 employees and the met has 2,500 , whereas dresden will need to reduce its personnel from 450 down to 259 due to budget restrictions . " it has long been impossible to run the museums in any normal way .
we can only race , panting , through our days , " roth wrote in die zeit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic green vault is known for its treasure chamber " every year the state finance minister expects more profit , and museum subsidies are cut deeply , " he wrote .
as a result , he said , the successful series of museum exhibits that showed off the treasures of dresden in metropolises like paris , moscow , new york , london and rome , can not continue . roth also said that the state seems only capable of funding new museums or expanding them , not running them , adding that the current finance ministry shows " mainly destructiveness or ignorance " when it comes to aesthetics . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden treasury reopens six decades after allied bombings the restored green vault at dresden 's royal palace , one of germany 's most celebrated museums , was unveiled more than 60 years after world war ii bombs reduced it to rubble .

there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .
the munich-based prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , said more information was necessary before legal action could begin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia agents allegedly relaxed on mallorca between flights but many journalists wonder why it is taking prosecutors to find out more about el-masri 's case .
in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue . " if the suspects involved were from libya , then prosecutors would have ordered their arrest a long time ago , " green party politician hans-christian ströbele told the paper . spanish police discovered the names of the suspects in spring 2005 .
a spanish journalist passed on the information to el-masri 's attorney , gnjidic , who turned the list over to german prosecutors in december 2005 , the süddeutsche zeitung reported . transatlantic tensions el-masri 's case has sparked diplomatic tension between washington and berlin . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this year that the united states had admitted making a mistake in detaining lebanese-born el-masri . the case heightened the controversy about the cia 's so-called rendition program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to secret prisons in other countries for questioning . us president george w. bush admitted earlier this month that the cia had covertly held prisoners in overseas prisons . el-masri sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trail could compromise us security by disclosing secret information but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

i would say shame , shame if the german people fail to take this matter serious and do something about it before it 's too late . - joh n allred i believe that when a democratic process selects a certain party over another , it should not be criticized .
to outlaw a party because we feel that some of their beliefs are not mainstream enough is to outlaw people 's freedom of choice for voting for that party .
every nation has its right wing , including famous democracies , including famous democracies like the us , and they also have neo-nazis who run for office.the population should have the freedom to elect whom it wants . - derrick stearns should the npd be banned from german politics ?
in my opinion , no .
if the npd gains the ascendancy in german elections it will be because of the will of the people as indicated by their votes and not otherwise .
also , if a society is truly to be democratic in practice and not in name only then there should be no attempts by the mainstream political parties and the media to obstruct a rival party from campaigning and participating in free elections .
the strength of a free democratic society rests in the voting populace being well informed on current issues and party platforms .
each party should be given equal access to the public in order to express its own views , and in the end it 's the people themselves who will decide by their votes what political party best represents their views and what is best for the future of germany . - mitchell kelly compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts .

with the motto " fairness for the döner " producers are doing their best to restore their image . despite the recent rotten meat scandal , chancellor angela merkel said last week that she will enjoy an occasional dö n er , the turkish lamb sandwich that can be found at fast-food stands on practically every corner in german cities . many other fans of the turkish delicacy are back to doing the same . although döner consumption had dropped by as much as 50 percent in some places in germany following the meat scandal , revenue has nearly boomeranged back to where it was before , said remzi kaplan from the association of turkish döner producers in europe . i n te n sive quality assura n ce process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a döner is usually made with lamb , though other varieties are available " we have sufficient monitoring , " said kaplan , whose döner business has annually received awards for quality since 2004m , at a berlin press conference under the motto " fairness for the döner . " " anyone can come to our company anytime and see how the döners are produced , " he added . with regular microbiological trend analyses , germ and odor checks and temperature measurements , döner producers are bound to the hygiene and health standards set by the european union . tests are conducted throughout the entire process , from the arrival of the raw meat to the production and delivery of the döner skewer .
each skewer is also marked with a unique serial number so that it can be traced back from the retailer to the producer , if necessary . " warehouses are weakest li n k " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remzi kaplan and his daughter shook their hips at a party in his berlin restaurant during the recent series of police checks , some rancid meat was discovered at döner stands , but cedar coskun , a quality assurance advisory for the döner industry , said the producers of the giant lamb skewers were not to blame . " as far as rotten meat is concerned , the weakest link in the chain is the mass warehouses , " coskun said .
" they 're the ones that store tons of meat over several years . " even if the recent affair is not exclusively a döner scandal , the industry is n't totally off the hook . of the 12,000 döner stands in germany , around 1,000 sell their wares at dumping prices .
to offer a döner for 79 or 99 euro cents -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.20 -rrb- , quality has to suffer , said kaplan , berlin 's largest döner producer . mi n imum price proposed kaplan 's co-worker sir atesever has advocated a minimum price of three euros per döner as a means of insuring quality ingredients . mehmet cam , deputy chairman of the society of turkish producers in europe , said he supports banning from the business altogether producers that infringe on quality standards . " the names of those food establishments that do n't follow the regulations - not only in the döner branch but in general - should be made public , " cam said .
" it should be very strict . " as a consequence of the meat scandal , the german ministry of economics is currently preparing a law that would prohibit the sale of food products under the acquisition price . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de official : meat scandal thus far " tip of the iceberg " the spoiled meat found in the current scandal plaguing the german meat industry is just " the tip of the iceberg , " according to the the federation of german food and drink industries .

some german politicians , however , feel help is n't necessary . meeting with his eu counterparts in finland , spanish justice minister juan fernando lopez aguilar said that his country was urging other bloc members to show more solidarity with those states responsible for securing the union 's external borders . " we 're not going to stop until the whole of the european union provides an answer , because an answer is needed , " he said , adding that italy and malta were also affected . " we come here , not to ask for help but to push for the proper help that is needed , not only for spain but for the rest of the european member states which are the southern frontier of the european union , " he said . when asked what he thought was needed , lopez aguilar said : " money , resources , means , determination and the consciousnesses that this is not a simple contingency , this is a reality which is going to accompany all of us along the way in the first third of the 21st century .

with the motto " fairness for the döner " producers are doing their best to restore their image . despite the recent rotten meat scandal , chancellor angela merkel said last week that she will enjoy an occasional dö n er , the turkish lamb sandwich that can be found at fast-food stands on practically every corner in german cities . many other fans of the turkish delicacy are back to doing the same . although döner consumption had dropped by as much as 50 percent in some places in germany following the meat scandal , revenue has nearly boomeranged back to where it was before , said remzi kaplan from the association of turkish döner producers in europe . i n te n sive quality assura n ce process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a döner is usually made with lamb , though other varieties are available " we have sufficient monitoring , " said kaplan , whose döner business has annually received awards for quality since 2004m , at a berlin press conference under the motto " fairness for the döner . " " anyone can come to our company anytime and see how the döners are produced , " he added . with regular microbiological trend analyses , germ and odor checks and temperature measurements , döner producers are bound to the hygiene and health standards set by the european union . tests are conducted throughout the entire process , from the arrival of the raw meat to the production and delivery of the döner skewer .
each skewer is also marked with a unique serial number so that it can be traced back from the retailer to the producer , if necessary . " warehouses are weakest li n k " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remzi kaplan and his daughter shook their hips at a party in his berlin restaurant during the recent series of police checks , some rancid meat was discovered at döner stands , but cedar coskun , a quality assurance advisory for the döner industry , said the producers of the giant lamb skewers were not to blame . " as far as rotten meat is concerned , the weakest link in the chain is the mass warehouses , " coskun said .
" they 're the ones that store tons of meat over several years . " even if the recent affair is not exclusively a döner scandal , the industry is n't totally off the hook . of the 12,000 döner stands in germany , around 1,000 sell their wares at dumping prices .
to offer a döner for 79 or 99 euro cents -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.20 -rrb- , quality has to suffer , said kaplan , berlin 's largest döner producer . mi n imum price proposed kaplan 's co-worker sir atesever has advocated a minimum price of three euros per döner as a means of insuring quality ingredients . mehmet cam , deputy chairman of the society of turkish producers in europe , said he supports banning from the business altogether producers that infringe on quality standards . " the names of those food establishments that do n't follow the regulations - not only in the döner branch but in general - should be made public , " cam said .
" it should be very strict . " as a consequence of the meat scandal , the german ministry of economics is currently preparing a law that would prohibit the sale of food products under the acquisition price . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de official : meat scandal thus far " tip of the iceberg " the spoiled meat found in the current scandal plaguing the german meat industry is just " the tip of the iceberg , " according to the the federation of german food and drink industries .

with the motto " fairness for the döner " producers are doing their best to restore their image . despite the recent rotten meat scandal , chancellor angela merkel said last week that she will enjoy an occasional dö n er , the turkish lamb sandwich that can be found at fast-food stands on practically every corner in german cities . many other fans of the turkish delicacy are back to doing the same . although döner consumption had dropped by as much as 50 percent in some places in germany following the meat scandal , revenue has nearly boomeranged back to where it was before , said remzi kaplan from the association of turkish döner producers in europe . i n te n sive quality assura n ce process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a döner is usually made with lamb , though other varieties are available " we have sufficient monitoring , " said kaplan , whose döner business has annually received awards for quality since 2004m , at a berlin press conference under the motto " fairness for the döner . " " anyone can come to our company anytime and see how the döners are produced , " he added . with regular microbiological trend analyses , germ and odor checks and temperature measurements , döner producers are bound to the hygiene and health standards set by the european union . tests are conducted throughout the entire process , from the arrival of the raw meat to the production and delivery of the döner skewer .
each skewer is also marked with a unique serial number so that it can be traced back from the retailer to the producer , if necessary .

" they 're the ones that store tons of meat over several years . " even if the recent affair is not exclusively a döner scandal , the industry is n't totally off the hook . of the 12,000 döner stands in germany , around 1,000 sell their wares at dumping prices .
to offer a döner for 79 or 99 euro cents -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.20 -rrb- , quality has to suffer , said kaplan , berlin 's largest döner producer . mi n imum price proposed kaplan 's co-worker sir atesever has advocated a minimum price of three euros per döner as a means of insuring quality ingredients . mehmet cam , deputy chairman of the society of turkish producers in europe , said he supports banning from the business altogether producers that infringe on quality standards . " the names of those food establishments that do n't follow the regulations - not only in the döner branch but in general - should be made public , " cam said .
" it should be very strict . " as a consequence of the meat scandal , the german ministry of economics is currently preparing a law that would prohibit the sale of food products under the acquisition price . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de official : meat scandal thus far " tip of the iceberg " the spoiled meat found in the current scandal plaguing the german meat industry is just " the tip of the iceberg , " according to the the federation of german food and drink industries .

there , cia agents allegedly beat and abducted german citizen khaled el-masri , who they suspected of being a terrorist , on jan .
23 , 2004 and took him to a us-run prison in afghanistan .
they likewise imprisoned an ethiopian man named binyam mohamed .
both of them , the agents claimed , had connections to the terrorist organization al qaeda . el-masri was not released until five months later .
during that time , cia specialists apparently tried to break the will of the prisoners by playing music so loud , that one of his eardrums burst , el-masri said . cia left traces spanish police were able to uncover the names of all the cia agents on el-masri 's flight , most of which , however , were aliases . german prosecutors on thursday said spain was helping them to identify the men who seized el-masri . the munich-based state prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , told afp the spanish authorities had handed over a list of 20 names , believed to be us agents , who may have been involved in the kidnapping of khaled el-masri . " we are making specific enquiries to the spanish authorities , " stern said . stern also confirmed a süddeutsche zeitung newspaper report that spanish police tracked some of the cia 's pilots who had stayed in a hotel on mallorca before they kidnapped al-masri .
they registered under aliases and used diplomats ' passports .
three of the pilots apparently used the false names eric fain , james fairing and kirk james bird .
spanish authorities were able to identify the agents , because personnel at the hotel where they stayed on mallorca made photocopies of their passports containing their pictures . all three presumably worked for the north carolina-based aero contractors company .
the new york times has reported on the firm 's involvement in other cia abduction missions , ard pointed out . hesitant german authorities el-masri 's attorney , manfred gnjidic , has requested that german prosecuting attorneys start preliminary proceedings against the alleged kidnappers now that their identities are known .
the munich-based prosecutor responsible for the case , august stern , said more information was necessary before legal action could begin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia agents allegedly relaxed on mallorca between flights but many journalists wonder why it is taking prosecutors to find out more about el-masri 's case .
in an article on thursday , the süddeutsche zeitung wondered why german legal authorities have been so hesitant about pursuing the issue . " if the suspects involved were from libya , then prosecutors would have ordered their arrest a long time ago , " green party politician hans-christian ströbele told the paper . spanish police discovered the names of the suspects in spring 2005 .
a spanish journalist passed on the information to el-masri 's attorney , gnjidic , who turned the list over to german prosecutors in december 2005 , the süddeutsche zeitung reported . transatlantic tensions el-masri 's case has sparked diplomatic tension between washington and berlin . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this year that the united states had admitted making a mistake in detaining lebanese-born el-masri . the case heightened the controversy about the cia 's so-called rendition program in which terror suspects were seized in one country and taken to secret prisons in other countries for questioning . us president george w. bush admitted earlier this month that the cia had covertly held prisoners in overseas prisons . el-masri sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trail could compromise us security by disclosing secret information but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european meps look into german role in cia deportations a european parliament delegation was in berlin to find out to what extent the german government and secret services turned a blind eye to us practices to deport detainees to other continents via european territory .

a report by the group said human rights activists in the country continue to be harassed while those facing the death penalty are not getting fair trials .
it also said people are being forced from their homes to make way for olympic construction projects .
amnesty international called on the chinese authorities to enact reforms .
" serious human rights violations continue to be reported across the country , fuelling instability and discontent , " the report said .
" grassroots human rights activists continue to be detained and imprisoned , and official controls over the media and the internet are growing tighter . "
' too soon ' amnesty also called on the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to exert pressure on the chinese government .
however , a spokesperson for the ioc said it was " unrealistic to expect the ioc to pressure on such complex matters " .
" it is premature to say china has failed to live up to the promises two years before the games , " communications director giselle davies told reuters news agency .
during bidding for the games in 2001 , the beijing committee pledged that a win for china would help promote the development of human rights in the country .

dr richard lewis , welsh secretary of the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , said the charges were an " indirect tax " on healthcare .
at least a quarter of welsh hospital trusts are drawing a six-figure income from parking charges , the bma said .
the welsh nhs confederation said the charges were about managing demand not making a profit out of patients .

bma welsh council chairman dr tony calland also called the charges a " tax on the sickest patients and their relatives " .
" the most ill section of the population has to visit hospital more frequently than those who are healthier and it is often these very ill people who , because of their illness , are the least able to pay the substantial car parking charges , " he said .
" the founding principle of the nhs was that healthcare should be free at the point of delivery . "
the welsh assembly government said parking was a matter for individual trusts who take into account a number of factors - such as patients ' needs and public transport - when deciding what facilities to provide .
mike ponton , director of the welsh nhs confederation , which represents all the nhs organisations in wales , said it was up to individual trusts to decide on car parking policy .
he said : " many nhs hospitals have a very limited supply of space .
at the same time , the demand for car park spaces keeps increasing .
" providing free parking for all could mean that patients and visitors can not park because spaces are being used by unscrupulous people who take advantage .
" on occasions , increasing congestion has even made it difficult for ambulances to access hospital entrances . "

since their stunning success in the first welsh assembly elections in 1999 , the party has been losing ground on several levels .
assembly seats have been lost , westminster and european seats have been lost , control of councils has been lost - so why does the party exude such optimism ?
they could be fooling themselves , of course , or attempting to fool political journalists or opponents .
private polling but political observers ignore such signs at their peril .
sometimes the party workers are right and the received wisdom is wrong - as the liberal democrats proved in ceredigion in the general election .
plaid recently published the results of private polling suggesting they are now in a position comparable to their standing in 1999 .
dafydd wigley has returned to front-line politics while the other parties have , predictably , dismissed the results , the poll was professionally conducted and has buoyed the party 's spirits .
so plaid starts its conference in swansea in surprisingly good heart .
the long saga of its split leadership appears to have been resolved with assembly leader ieuan wyn jones re-emerging as the overall leader of the party .
like a weeble , mr jones wobbles but he wo n't fall down .
publicity coup the party also now boasts that it has the largest staff of any political party in wales and has developed a series of eye-catching policies to be release over the coming months .
the recent plan to offer £ 5,000 grants to first-time home buyers is a classic example .
experts might well question its practicality and effectiveness but it was publicity coup certain to play well with sections of the electorate .
expect more of the same between now and may .
as in most pre-election conferences there are few debates likely to spark major controversy .
instead , the conference will show case the party 's big names in a series of set-piece speeches with the prime slot being awarded to dafydd wigley marking the former party leader 's return to front-line politics .

since their stunning success in the first welsh assembly elections in 1999 , the party has been losing ground on several levels .
assembly seats have been lost , westminster and european seats have been lost , control of councils has been lost - so why does the party exude such optimism ?
they could be fooling themselves , of course , or attempting to fool political journalists or opponents .
private polling but political observers ignore such signs at their peril .
sometimes the party workers are right and the received wisdom is wrong - as the liberal democrats proved in ceredigion in the general election .
plaid recently published the results of private polling suggesting they are now in a position comparable to their standing in 1999 .
dafydd wigley has returned to front-line politics while the other parties have , predictably , dismissed the results , the poll was professionally conducted and has buoyed the party 's spirits .
so plaid starts its conference in swansea in surprisingly good heart .
the long saga of its split leadership appears to have been resolved with assembly leader ieuan wyn jones re-emerging as the overall leader of the party .
like a weeble , mr jones wobbles but he wo n't fall down .
publicity coup the party also now boasts that it has the largest staff of any political party in wales and has developed a series of eye-catching policies to be release over the coming months .
the recent plan to offer £ 5,000 grants to first-time home buyers is a classic example .
experts might well question its practicality and effectiveness but it was publicity coup certain to play well with sections of the electorate .
expect more of the same between now and may .
as in most pre-election conferences there are few debates likely to spark major controversy .

the exhibition is the last major event in the gaming calendar before the ps3 goes on sale on 11 november .
the third incarnation of the popular games machine made its first tgs appearance last year .
since then , sony has delayed the launch , prompting a backlash from some parts of the gaming community .
japan has been a loyal market of sony , with nearly a quarter of the 100 million playstation 2 -lrb- ps2 -rrb- consoles sold worldwide bought by japanese gamers .
tgs will be the first time that gamers will be able to get their hands on the ps3 and a raft of playable titles .
public show tgs is the biggest dedicated gaming show in japan , the second largest gaming market in the world after the us .
it is now in its 10th year .
more than 140 companies are expected to attend the event in an attempt to grab a slice of an industry worth an annual $ 30bn globally .
e3 showcase slims down until now , the electronic entertainment expo -lrb- e3 -rrb- in los angeles has taken pride of place in the gaming calendar , with the big three console manufacturers - sony , nintendo and microsoft - jostling for the hearts , minds and wallets of gamers .
since the announcement that e3 will be downsized next year , the tgs has become even more important as an industry showcase .
along with sony , microsoft will be at tgs pushing its xbox 360 system .
however , nintendo traditionally forgo tgs in favour of their own events .
the three-day show officially kicks off on friday with a closed , press-only day .
unlike many game shows the doors are then thrown open to the public for the weekend .
big push sony is keen to make a big splash at this year 's event .
the company needs to persuade gamers that the delayed console is worth the wait , and the high price tag .
the budget version of the console will sell for 59800 yen in japan and 499 euros in europe .
the xbox 360 hit shelves last november the ps3 was scheduled to launch in spring this year but a technical hitch with the console 's blu-ray drive meant the firm was forced to delay the release .
european gamers suffered further disappointment in september this year when the company said that the 17 november european release date was being pushed back to 2007 .
japanese and us gamers will still get their hands on the console in november .
in a bid to showcase the cutting edge processing and graphical power of the ps3 , sony has announced 27 playable ps3 titles for the tgs , with a further 35 shown on video .
playable titles include devil may cry 4 , resistance : fall of man and ridge racer 7 .
some games will be updates of titles demonstrated earlier this year at e3 .
games showcase microsoft will also be present at tgs .
the firm 's xbox 360 went on sale around the world last november and has become an instant success .
microsoft has said it plans to ship 10 million consoles before the ps3 or nintendo 's latest console , the wii , hit the shops .
but microsoft has traditionally had difficulty cracking the loyal japanese gaming market .
nintendo traditionally shuns the tokyo games show when the 360 went on sale in the us and uk hardcore fans scrambled to get their hands on the console and it quickly sold out .
but japanese gamers were less enthusiastic .
at the console 's tokyo launch one store official described customer reaction as " subdued . "
microsoft will have some of their top executives at tgs including peter moore , head of microsoft 's game business .
they will push the 360 console to try to gain as much of a lead over sony before november .
at a pre-tgs event in tokyo , microsoft said it would be releasing a hd-dvd player for the xbox 360 on 17 november in japan , priced 19,800 yen -lrb- £ 89 -rrb- .
the high definition player is a rival to the blu-ray player inside the ps3 .
the us software firm is also hosting its own event , x06 , in barcelona later in september .
the event will showcase some of the next generation games for the 360 console .
demos and announcements from both events will be made available to users of the xbox live online gaming service .
wii launch the other large console maker , nintendo has a strong fan base in the country but the japanese manufacturer tends to hold its own events in place of tgs .
last week , nintendo announced launch dates and prices for its wii console at a series of worldwide press conferences .
the company said that the console would be available before christmas this year and that four million consoles would be available at launch .
more than 20 games would also be available including the legend of zelda : twilight princess .

security firm sunbelt software said the vulnerability was being actively exploited on some porn websites .
so far there is no fix to close the bug in the browsing program but microsoft has issued advice about how to avoid falling victim .
it said it would patch the bug in its next security update due on 10 october .
researcher adam thomas uncovered the exploit which revolves around the way that the internet explorer browser handles a particular form of graphics known as vector graphics .
a properly crafted webpage can exploit this problem and install almost anything they want on the target machine .
unusable pc tests by sunbelt software on a windows machine patched with all the latest security updates showed attackers installing a huge amount of spyware and other malicious programs .
staying safe online install anti-virus software keep your anti-virus software up to date install a personal firewall use windows updates to patch security holes do not open e-mail messages that look suspicious do not click on e-mail attachments you were not expecting what are the threats on the net ?
any windows pc suffering such an infection would become unusable .
following the discovery of the bug , microsoft issued a formal alert that tells users how to avoid falling victim while a patch is being prepared .
microsoft said the patch would be ready for the next monthly security update on 10 october .
however , it said it would release the patch earlier if the situation warrants it .

mr hammond had been in a dragster-style car capable of reaching speeds of about 300mph at elvington airfield near york .
the hospital said his wife was at his bedside and , at the request of his family , no more information would be released .
the crash will be investigated by the health and safety executive and the bbc .
the bbc said in a statement : " we are looking into all the factors of this accident and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage until we know the full situation . "
" he has brought an awful lot to the programme " quentin willson , former top gear presenter send us your comments the dragster car he was driving was believed to have been travelling at about 300mph when it crashed .
motoring expert adam rayner , of fast car magazine , said that at those speeds the driver would experience forces similar to those endured by fighter pilots .
" these cars accelerate at 6g - the force is breathtaking and stopping is a real difficulty , " he said .
former firefighter dave ogden , who runs private firm event fire services , was one of the first people at the scene of the crash .
he said : " we were down there with top gear who were filming him trying to break the british land speed record .
" on the previous run , the car had just gone over 300mph but i am not sure if it had broken the record .
" they had just done one more run and were planning to finish when it veered off to the right .
" one of the parachutes had deployed but it went on to the grass and spun over and over before coming to a rest about 100 yards from us . "
he said his crew and an ambulance that was already on the airfield rushed over and found the car upside down and " dug in " to the grass .
mr ogden said he felt for a pulse and heard mr hammond breathing before the emergency crews worked together to turn the car the right way up and then cut him free .
he added : " he was regaining consciousness at that point and said he had some lower back pain .
but he was drifting in and out of consciousness a little bit . "
former top gear presenter quentin willson said the presenter was " irreplaceable " .
' international personality ' he said : " he is a wonderful , unique and distinctive top gear presenter .
" he has brought an awful lot to the programme and his indefatigable energy , the fact that he tries absolutely anything once , may have been the reason that he has overstepped the mark a bit .
" he has turned top gear into a gang show with jeremy and james and the three of them have wowed audiences all over the world and he is an international personality . "
mr willson added : " there is no pressure from the bbc or the producer to take undue risks .
" but that pressure is in your own head .
you want to do an item on the programme which is mindblowing . "
the presenter , who works on top gear with fellow hosts jeremy clarkson and james may , grew up in solihull , was educated in yorkshire and lives near cheltenham with his wife and children .
in addition to presenting top gear for the bbc , he is also presenting the current series of brainiac on sky one .

hill had received a last-minute stay of execution in january .
judges rejected his final appeal by a 5-4 vote .
hill claimed chemicals used caused pain , violating a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
hill , 48 , was executed for the murder of a pensacola police officer in the early 1980s .
the initial intervention caused states across the country to review the lethal injection procedure .
his case led to a supreme court ruling in june , allowing death row inmates to file last-ditch challenges to lethal injections .
no final comment the ruling came after hill argued that the chemicals used would cause unnecessary pain and violate his civil rights .
hill was said not to have made any final comment before being executed .
" i did not see anything that reflected any kind of pain , " robby cunningham , a spokesman of the florida department of corrections , told the afp news agency .
" he was very calm all the time , not having a final word , he laid there calmly on the gurney . "

of the 6,000 who leave care each year , 4,500 will have no qualifications and a fifth will be homeless , says the study by the centre for policy studies .
report author harriet sergeant said the system was failing young people and society and perpetuating an underclass .
the government admitted that more needs to be done despite recent improvements .
in 2005 , 60,900 children were in care with most placed with foster parents or in children 's homes .
abusive childhood the report - entitled handle with care : an investigation into the care system - showed most were in care due to abuse or neglect -lrb- 62 % -rrb- , family dysfunction -lrb- 10 % -rrb- , absent parents -lrb- 8 % -rrb- , and socially unacceptable behaviour -lrb- 3 % -rrb- .

" a successful system of care would transform this country , empty a third of our prisons and shift half of all prisoners under the age of 25 out of the criminal justice system .
" it would halve the number of prostitutes and homeless , and remove 80 % of big issue sellers from our street corners . "
the report said the problem is not the amount of money - the government spends £ 40,000 on each child - but the way it is spent .
it added that children were being moved " far too frequently " between carers , care homes focused on short-term containment rather than long-term success , and there was not enough support for charges once they had left the system .

of the 6,000 who leave care each year , 4,500 will have no qualifications and a fifth will be homeless , says the study by the centre for policy studies .
report author harriet sergeant said the system was failing young people and society and perpetuating an underclass .
the government admitted that more needs to be done despite recent improvements .
in 2005 , 60,900 children were in care with most placed with foster parents or in children 's homes .
abusive childhood the report - entitled handle with care : an investigation into the care system - showed most were in care due to abuse or neglect -lrb- 62 % -rrb- , family dysfunction -lrb- 10 % -rrb- , absent parents -lrb- 8 % -rrb- , and socially unacceptable behaviour -lrb- 3 % -rrb- .
it also found : within two years of leaving care 3,000 of 6,000 young people will be unemployed 2,100 will be mothers or pregnant 1,200 will be homeless nearly half of all young people leave care at 16 or 17 ms sergeant said a childhood of abuse followed by an adolescence spent in care sets up young people for all the disadvantages that define social exclusion : illiteracy , homelessness , drug and alcohol dependency , prostitution and criminality .
" a successful system of care would transform this country , empty a third of our prisons and shift half of all prisoners under the age of 25 out of the criminal justice system .
" it would halve the number of prostitutes and homeless , and remove 80 % of big issue sellers from our street corners . "
the report said the problem is not the amount of money - the government spends £ 40,000 on each child - but the way it is spent .
it added that children were being moved " far too frequently " between carers , care homes focused on short-term containment rather than long-term success , and there was not enough support for charges once they had left the system .
there is no single person doing what a good parent does for their own children beverley hughes minister for children it called for " secure , stable , long-term and loving care for difficult children " .
among the children quoted in the study was one 14-year-old girl who had been through 30 placements .

of the 6,000 who leave care each year , 4,500 will have no qualifications and a fifth will be homeless , says the study by the centre for policy studies .
report author harriet sergeant said the system was failing young people and society and perpetuating an underclass .
the government admitted that more needs to be done despite recent improvements .
in 2005 , 60,900 children were in care with most placed with foster parents or in children 's homes .
abusive childhood the report - entitled handle with care : an investigation into the care system - showed most were in care due to abuse or neglect -lrb- 62 % -rrb- , family dysfunction -lrb- 10 % -rrb- , absent parents -lrb- 8 % -rrb- , and socially unacceptable behaviour -lrb- 3 % -rrb- .
it also found : within two years of leaving care 3,000 of 6,000 young people will be unemployed 2,100 will be mothers or pregnant 1,200 will be homeless nearly half of all young people leave care at 16 or 17 ms sergeant said a childhood of abuse followed by an adolescence spent in care sets up young people for all the disadvantages that define social exclusion : illiteracy , homelessness , drug and alcohol dependency , prostitution and criminality .
" a successful system of care would transform this country , empty a third of our prisons and shift half of all prisoners under the age of 25 out of the criminal justice system .
" it would halve the number of prostitutes and homeless , and remove 80 % of big issue sellers from our street corners . "
the report said the problem is not the amount of money - the government spends £ 40,000 on each child - but the way it is spent .
it added that children were being moved " far too frequently " between carers , care homes focused on short-term containment rather than long-term success , and there was not enough support for charges once they had left the system .
there is no single person doing what a good parent does for their own children beverley hughes minister for children it called for " secure , stable , long-term and loving care for difficult children " .
among the children quoted in the study was one 14-year-old girl who had been through 30 placements .
" you feel like a bit of rubbish yourself who no-one wants , " she is quoted as saying .

she said a lack of accountability and a fragmented system were to blame .
" there is no single person doing what a good parent does for their own children , that is driving the system , making it work , making sure the health checks are done , making sure the schools are delivering , " she said .
the department for education and skills said it was working on a consultation document on a range of proposals to transform the outcomes of children in care .
the department said it would look at " how we can close the gap in the life chances and academic performance of looked after children and improve their prospects significantly " .
