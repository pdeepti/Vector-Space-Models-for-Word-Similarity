after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .

" politicians , put your own houses in order , " he told an audience of 3,000 .
" belarus has a solid immune system .
your clumsy attempts to import revolution have had a contrary effect - they have become an antidote to the ' colors ' sickness , " he said in a reference to ukraine 's " orange " revolution and georgia 's " rose " upheaval . lukashenko , 51 , who won a march 19 election condemned as unfair by outside observers , said he " regretted " that european union newcomers poland and the three baltic states were " at the head of a crusade against belarus " and promised security , order and calm . ceremonies began in the formal setting of the palace of the republic , decorated with red carpets , national emblems and bunches of roses , and were carried live on national television . the palace overlooks october square where thousands of demonstrators gathered for several days to protest against lukashenko 's re-election with a colossal majority . lukashenko was applauded by his backers , members of the government , members of parliament , regional representatives , members of the judiciary , scientists and artists . isolation confirmed as leaders stay away no foreign leaders were present .
among foreign delegations was that of the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- the former soviet union minus the baltic states -rrb- . " we have n't invited heads of state .

but the absence of even close allies such as russian president vladimir putin underlines lukashenko 's reduced international standing following an election that the west said was rigged . in power since 1994 , lukashenko was officially said to have won 83 percent of the march 19 vote , with his nearest rival , alexander milinkevich , getting 6.1 percent . overnight , authorities freed several people who had completed jail terms of up to 15 days for taking part in a week of protests following the election . among those released were canadian journalist frederic lavoie and a number of russian citizens who had joined in a days-long protest camp in october square . nonetheless about 100 activists assembled on october square late friday with flags and banners reading " no to fascism , no to lukashism " , before they were dispersed by police . europe prepares to slap travel ban on belarusian officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president and 30 other officials will be banned from travel in the eu the inauguration was expected to be followed on monday by a decision by eu foreign ministers to slap a travel ban on 31 belarusian politicians and top officials including lukashenko , eu officials said earlier . the west accuses lukashenko 's leadership of suppressing opposition groups and independent media , as well as being involved in the disappearance of several political figures in recent years . the united states has also said it plans to strengthen sanctions against the belarusian leadership , having dubbed the country " europe 's last dictatorship " . opposition promised support from germany , poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milinkevich was pledged support by germany 's merkel milinkevich on friday completed a european tour that included a visit to the european parliament in strasbourg and meetings with german chancellor angela merkel and polish president lech kaczynski . merkel and kaczynski agreed on joint action to help belarusian pro-democracy activists and students thrown out of their universities , a joint statement said friday night . during telephone talks , kaczynski and merkel " agreed on joint action to help democratic forces in belarus and belarusian students expelled from their universities who want to continue their studies abroad , " the president 's office said in a statement . the statement did not give details . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus opposition leader urges pressure , not sanctions one day before alexander lukashenko 's third inauguration as president of belarus , opposition leader alexander milinkevich once again urged the west to step up the pressure on " the last dictatorship in europe .

but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .
the iea also assumes a savings potential of up to 20 nuclear power plants , spread across the 30 countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . in addition , an efficient use of energy could reduce worldwide demand by 15 percent , according to the iea .
renewable energies such as sun , wind or water have to finally be seriously promoted and used , said paulitz . at least the share of nuclear energy in europe will not change significantly in the next 20 years . " one-third of the energy mix is a good size , " said wesselmann .
paulitz also does n't expect any major changes in the european nuclear sector . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .

" an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .
the iea also assumes a savings potential of up to 20 nuclear power plants , spread across the 30 countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . in addition , an efficient use of energy could reduce worldwide demand by 15 percent , according to the iea .
renewable energies such as sun , wind or water have to finally be seriously promoted and used , said paulitz . at least the share of nuclear energy in europe will not change significantly in the next 20 years . " one-third of the energy mix is a good size , " said wesselmann .
paulitz also does n't expect any major changes in the european nuclear sector . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2006 election begins slowly as italy starts two days of voting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians face a confusing array of symbols and candidates in italy 's disparate election ballot conservative prime minister silvio berlusconi 's job was on the line sunday , facing a stiff challenge from his centre-left rival romano prodi as voters went to the polls in italy 's first general election for five years . some 60,000 polling stations around the country opened at 8:00 am -lrb- 0600 gmt -rrb- , beginning two days of polling which will end monday at 3:00 pm .
first results are expected later that day . with balloting spread over two days , voting early sunday was not expected to be particularly brisk .
around 50 people voted in the first half hour of polling at the lungatevere della farnesina station in rome , close to the vatican . " i voted for those who are defending our values : the family , education and security .
these values are not only religious values but of society in general , " said one nun who voted with around 30 others from her order after attending morning mass to celebrate palm sunday . berlusconi , 69 , has repeatedly called on voters to defend italy 's " christian identity " and family values against a perceived threat from prodi 's centre-left which includes communists who want legal recognition of same-sex couples . his centre-right bloc has come under fire in a vitriolic campaign which focused on italy 's dire economic performance , tax cuts and unemployment . the campaign was marked by a clash of styles between the suave and voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , and prodi 's more diffident , professorial approach . clear lines of division despite confusing ballot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messiah , emperor , unemployed ?
berlsuconi faces an uncertain vote berlusconi , in what analysts said was an attempt to focus voter attention on him during a media blitz , has memorably compared himself to jesus christ , napoleon , and used a vulgar epithet to describe left-wing voters . " i voted left to send berlusconi packing , " said daniele calente , a civil servant .
" but i 'm afraid his media bombardment might have made a difference , and all his lies . " " i 've always voted left but this time it 's more important than ever and i 'm convinced prodi ca n't lose , " said grazia , 55 , who voted with her husband . paolo , 40 , said he had plumped for the centre-left " because we have to get rid of berlusconi . " prodi takes slender lead into vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi can count on the anti-berlusconi vote prodi , a 66-year-old former eu commission president who began his career as a university professor , held a narrow lead in opinion polls before surveys were suspended under electoral law two weeks ago . however , up to 25 percent of voters were undecided going into the polls . millions of italians living abroad have been allowed to vote in a general election for the first time .
the foreign ministry reported a 42 percent " turnout " in the expatriate vote after collating the mailed ballots . berlusconi , the colorful 69-year-old prime minister who became the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , is hoping for a much higher turnout in traditional polling . " vote !

threatened with relegation and winless in their past five matches , duisburg president walter hellmich said he did n't have a choice in letting the trainer go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler had a lot to scream about in duisburg many reasons for being shown the door " jürgen kohler was one of the best players in germany in the last century but was unable to create a successful team spirit , " he said .
" you ca n't survive in the relegation battle without that . " the 10th coach to sent packing , it may be of little consolation that hellmich 's grounds were purely soccer related .
unlike kohler 's predecessor , norbert meier , who , after guiding duisburg back to the first division , got the boot in december for second-rate results as well as head butting a cologne player . things are looking good for stuttgart 's armin veh these days either .
after taking over for giovanni trapattoni , the italian maestro who was supposed to lead stuttgart to the champions league , nearly two months ago , veh might want to starting polishing his resume . veh knows he 'll need a positive result this week against nuremburg to fight off the naysayers , including stuttgart club chairman dieter hundt , who called the still-coach a " temporary solution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh knows there are rough times ahead for stuttgart high expectations come crashing to the ground " it 's not so easy when there is so much unrest in the team , " veh said .
" this condition ca n't continue over the long-term . " wolfgang wolf may not want to spend too much time thinking about long-term goals . at first glance , the kaiserslautern coach is an obvious choice for a trainer who is likely to be spending next season with a beer in front the tv .
kaiserslautern have booked the fewest points , have worst goal-difference and have generally played poorly over the past few weeks . second division despair but the club , which already sacked michael henke at the winter break , could have problems finding a person willing to take on the team if they are relegated - leaving wolf with the unenviable , albeit salaried , job of getting the " red devils " out of the despair that is second division bus trips across the country for a 90 minute game . should a player or coach need more motivation than playing in front of tiny crowds in the mini second division stadiums , a positive attitude can also help push a team out of the last three spots - at least that 's what mainz 05 coach jürgen klopp seems to be hoping . after a humiliating 3-0 loss to nuremburg last week , the pollyanna said he had plenty of reason to look on the bright side . " my team ca n't play like such crap two weeks in a row , " klopp said .
he can bet his boss will be looking to see that theory proved saturday against hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 13 games without a win , götz can be glad he only had to fix the pitch for a photo-op loss do n't automatically mean pink slips but there is proof , however minimal , that a coach can turn the situation around . falko götz passed on long-assumed title of 10th bundesliga trainer out the door to duisburg 's kohler and is currently standing comfortably in the hertha berlin coaching box despite the fact that he went 13 straight games without a win . then again , his team , now fighting for a uefa cup berth , was never in real danger of playing the likes of kickers offenbach and 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.04.2006 bestselling german-jewish author satirizes the holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin author edgar hilsenrath just turned 80 satirizing the holocaust has long been a taboo theme in germany .
after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2006 nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german nuclear power plant in biblis has shown some defects nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .

after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .

" the temporary suspension of direct aid to the palestinian government is ... a very clear signal , " said one british official , adding that the " message from ministers will be an endorsement " of the eu commission 's decision . eu attempts to limit impact of suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu funds help to ease the strain of living in places like the gaza strip the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels , and the rest from individual eu governments . the money goes through a web of channels for a wide variety of purposes , from refugee aid to pure budgetary support , and working out exactly how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task . the eu is all too aware of the potential impact on the already battered local economy , and has vowed to do everything possible to limit the impact on ordinary palestinians , such as funneling more money through aid agencies . but one source said that the suspension decision could cut over 30 million euros , while others say that nearly half of eu aid is at risk . palestinian premier ismail haniya lashed out at the eu and us moves saturday , saying : " the decision of the west , the united states and the israeli occupation are unjust .
they aim at blackmailing us . " europeans reject claims of blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas remains on the eu 's list of terror organizations but the eu is clearly in no mood to appease the leadership of an organization which remains on its blacklist of terrorist organizations . " they should n't claim blackmail .
they do n't only live on international aid .
and we have been clear about our principles from the start , from before the elections .
they have n't been taken by surprise , " said a french source . he noted that the eu gave 120 million euros to the caretaker palestinian government shortly before the hamas-led cabinet took office . " we encouraged them by giving them 120 million just before the government was nominated .
we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

threatened with relegation and winless in their past five matches , duisburg president walter hellmich said he did n't have a choice in letting the trainer go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler had a lot to scream about in duisburg many reasons for being shown the door " jürgen kohler was one of the best players in germany in the last century but was unable to create a successful team spirit , " he said .
" you ca n't survive in the relegation battle without that . " the 10th coach to sent packing , it may be of little consolation that hellmich 's grounds were purely soccer related .
unlike kohler 's predecessor , norbert meier , who , after guiding duisburg back to the first division , got the boot in december for second-rate results as well as head butting a cologne player . things are looking good for stuttgart 's armin veh these days either .
after taking over for giovanni trapattoni , the italian maestro who was supposed to lead stuttgart to the champions league , nearly two months ago , veh might want to starting polishing his resume . veh knows he 'll need a positive result this week against nuremburg to fight off the naysayers , including stuttgart club chairman dieter hundt , who called the still-coach a " temporary solution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh knows there are rough times ahead for stuttgart high expectations come crashing to the ground " it 's not so easy when there is so much unrest in the team , " veh said .
" this condition ca n't continue over the long-term . " wolfgang wolf may not want to spend too much time thinking about long-term goals . at first glance , the kaiserslautern coach is an obvious choice for a trainer who is likely to be spending next season with a beer in front the tv .

threatened with relegation and winless in their past five matches , duisburg president walter hellmich said he did n't have a choice in letting the trainer go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler had a lot to scream about in duisburg many reasons for being shown the door " jürgen kohler was one of the best players in germany in the last century but was unable to create a successful team spirit , " he said .
" you ca n't survive in the relegation battle without that . " the 10th coach to sent packing , it may be of little consolation that hellmich 's grounds were purely soccer related .
unlike kohler 's predecessor , norbert meier , who , after guiding duisburg back to the first division , got the boot in december for second-rate results as well as head butting a cologne player . things are looking good for stuttgart 's armin veh these days either .
after taking over for giovanni trapattoni , the italian maestro who was supposed to lead stuttgart to the champions league , nearly two months ago , veh might want to starting polishing his resume . veh knows he 'll need a positive result this week against nuremburg to fight off the naysayers , including stuttgart club chairman dieter hundt , who called the still-coach a " temporary solution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh knows there are rough times ahead for stuttgart high expectations come crashing to the ground " it 's not so easy when there is so much unrest in the team , " veh said .
" this condition ca n't continue over the long-term . " wolfgang wolf may not want to spend too much time thinking about long-term goals . at first glance , the kaiserslautern coach is an obvious choice for a trainer who is likely to be spending next season with a beer in front the tv .
kaiserslautern have booked the fewest points , have worst goal-difference and have generally played poorly over the past few weeks . second division despair but the club , which already sacked michael henke at the winter break , could have problems finding a person willing to take on the team if they are relegated - leaving wolf with the unenviable , albeit salaried , job of getting the " red devils " out of the despair that is second division bus trips across the country for a 90 minute game . should a player or coach need more motivation than playing in front of tiny crowds in the mini second division stadiums , a positive attitude can also help push a team out of the last three spots - at least that 's what mainz 05 coach jürgen klopp seems to be hoping . after a humiliating 3-0 loss to nuremburg last week , the pollyanna said he had plenty of reason to look on the bright side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2006 nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german nuclear power plant in biblis has shown some defects nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .
the iea also assumes a savings potential of up to 20 nuclear power plants , spread across the 30 countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . in addition , an efficient use of energy could reduce worldwide demand by 15 percent , according to the iea .
renewable energies such as sun , wind or water have to finally be seriously promoted and used , said paulitz . at least the share of nuclear energy in europe will not change significantly in the next 20 years . " one-third of the energy mix is a good size , " said wesselmann .
paulitz also does n't expect any major changes in the european nuclear sector . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- germany to massively invest in energy sector political and industry leaders have agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate .

after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2006 election begins slowly as italy starts two days of voting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians face a confusing array of symbols and candidates in italy 's disparate election ballot conservative prime minister silvio berlusconi 's job was on the line sunday , facing a stiff challenge from his centre-left rival romano prodi as voters went to the polls in italy 's first general election for five years . some 60,000 polling stations around the country opened at 8:00 am -lrb- 0600 gmt -rrb- , beginning two days of polling which will end monday at 3:00 pm .
first results are expected later that day . with balloting spread over two days , voting early sunday was not expected to be particularly brisk .
around 50 people voted in the first half hour of polling at the lungatevere della farnesina station in rome , close to the vatican . " i voted for those who are defending our values : the family , education and security .
these values are not only religious values but of society in general , " said one nun who voted with around 30 others from her order after attending morning mass to celebrate palm sunday . berlusconi , 69 , has repeatedly called on voters to defend italy 's " christian identity " and family values against a perceived threat from prodi 's centre-left which includes communists who want legal recognition of same-sex couples . his centre-right bloc has come under fire in a vitriolic campaign which focused on italy 's dire economic performance , tax cuts and unemployment . the campaign was marked by a clash of styles between the suave and voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , and prodi 's more diffident , professorial approach . clear lines of division despite confusing ballot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messiah , emperor , unemployed ?
berlsuconi faces an uncertain vote berlusconi , in what analysts said was an attempt to focus voter attention on him during a media blitz , has memorably compared himself to jesus christ , napoleon , and used a vulgar epithet to describe left-wing voters . " i voted left to send berlusconi packing , " said daniele calente , a civil servant .
" but i 'm afraid his media bombardment might have made a difference , and all his lies . " " i 've always voted left but this time it 's more important than ever and i 'm convinced prodi ca n't lose , " said grazia , 55 , who voted with her husband . paolo , 40 , said he had plumped for the centre-left " because we have to get rid of berlusconi . " prodi takes slender lead into vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi can count on the anti-berlusconi vote prodi , a 66-year-old former eu commission president who began his career as a university professor , held a narrow lead in opinion polls before surveys were suspended under electoral law two weeks ago . however , up to 25 percent of voters were undecided going into the polls . millions of italians living abroad have been allowed to vote in a general election for the first time .
the foreign ministry reported a 42 percent " turnout " in the expatriate vote after collating the mailed ballots . berlusconi , the colorful 69-year-old prime minister who became the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , is hoping for a much higher turnout in traditional polling . " vote !
vote !
vote ! " trumpeted the banner headline of il giornale , the daily newspaper owned by berlusconi 's businessman brother paolo . higher turnout likely to favor berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting started slowly on sunday analysts say a high turnout is likely to favor his centre-right house of freedoms bloc , which includes his forza italia party , the national alliance of deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , and the northern league of umberto bossi . berlusconi has also made pre-electoral pacts with a slew of other parties , including a neo-fascist group led by alessandra mussolini . prodi leads a more disparate centre-left grouping , which includes the largest individual opposition party , the democrats of the left of piero fassino , the moderate margherita -lrb- daisy -rrb- party of francesco rutelli , and italy 's two communist parties . voters will choose 630 members in the lower house of parliament , the chamber of deputies , and 315 in the senate , under a proportional representation system which has recently been re-adopted after a law in december junked the old , mainly first-past-the-post , system . electors are being presented with a ballot paper indicating a blinding array of party symbols .
they are casting their ballots not for individuals , but for parties .
the more votes a party gets , the more members on its list win seats in the new parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian elections : the foreign policy question berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?

after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

" an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .

uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .

" the temporary suspension of direct aid to the palestinian government is ... a very clear signal , " said one british official , adding that the " message from ministers will be an endorsement " of the eu commission 's decision . eu attempts to limit impact of suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu funds help to ease the strain of living in places like the gaza strip the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels , and the rest from individual eu governments . the money goes through a web of channels for a wide variety of purposes , from refugee aid to pure budgetary support , and working out exactly how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task . the eu is all too aware of the potential impact on the already battered local economy , and has vowed to do everything possible to limit the impact on ordinary palestinians , such as funneling more money through aid agencies . but one source said that the suspension decision could cut over 30 million euros , while others say that nearly half of eu aid is at risk . palestinian premier ismail haniya lashed out at the eu and us moves saturday , saying : " the decision of the west , the united states and the israeli occupation are unjust .
they aim at blackmailing us . " europeans reject claims of blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas remains on the eu 's list of terror organizations but the eu is clearly in no mood to appease the leadership of an organization which remains on its blacklist of terrorist organizations . " they should n't claim blackmail .
they do n't only live on international aid .

first results are expected later that day . with balloting spread over two days , voting early sunday was not expected to be particularly brisk .
around 50 people voted in the first half hour of polling at the lungatevere della farnesina station in rome , close to the vatican . " i voted for those who are defending our values : the family , education and security .
these values are not only religious values but of society in general , " said one nun who voted with around 30 others from her order after attending morning mass to celebrate palm sunday . berlusconi , 69 , has repeatedly called on voters to defend italy 's " christian identity " and family values against a perceived threat from prodi 's centre-left which includes communists who want legal recognition of same-sex couples . his centre-right bloc has come under fire in a vitriolic campaign which focused on italy 's dire economic performance , tax cuts and unemployment . the campaign was marked by a clash of styles between the suave and voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , and prodi 's more diffident , professorial approach . clear lines of division despite confusing ballot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messiah , emperor , unemployed ?
berlsuconi faces an uncertain vote berlusconi , in what analysts said was an attempt to focus voter attention on him during a media blitz , has memorably compared himself to jesus christ , napoleon , and used a vulgar epithet to describe left-wing voters . " i voted left to send berlusconi packing , " said daniele calente , a civil servant .
" but i 'm afraid his media bombardment might have made a difference , and all his lies . " " i 've always voted left but this time it 's more important than ever and i 'm convinced prodi ca n't lose , " said grazia , 55 , who voted with her husband . paolo , 40 , said he had plumped for the centre-left " because we have to get rid of berlusconi . " prodi takes slender lead into vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi can count on the anti-berlusconi vote prodi , a 66-year-old former eu commission president who began his career as a university professor , held a narrow lead in opinion polls before surveys were suspended under electoral law two weeks ago . however , up to 25 percent of voters were undecided going into the polls . millions of italians living abroad have been allowed to vote in a general election for the first time .
the foreign ministry reported a 42 percent " turnout " in the expatriate vote after collating the mailed ballots . berlusconi , the colorful 69-year-old prime minister who became the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , is hoping for a much higher turnout in traditional polling . " vote !
vote !
vote ! " trumpeted the banner headline of il giornale , the daily newspaper owned by berlusconi 's businessman brother paolo . higher turnout likely to favor berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting started slowly on sunday analysts say a high turnout is likely to favor his centre-right house of freedoms bloc , which includes his forza italia party , the national alliance of deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , and the northern league of umberto bossi . berlusconi has also made pre-electoral pacts with a slew of other parties , including a neo-fascist group led by alessandra mussolini . prodi leads a more disparate centre-left grouping , which includes the largest individual opposition party , the democrats of the left of piero fassino , the moderate margherita -lrb- daisy -rrb- party of francesco rutelli , and italy 's two communist parties . voters will choose 630 members in the lower house of parliament , the chamber of deputies , and 315 in the senate , under a proportional representation system which has recently been re-adopted after a law in december junked the old , mainly first-past-the-post , system . electors are being presented with a ballot paper indicating a blinding array of party symbols .
they are casting their ballots not for individuals , but for parties .

first results are expected later that day . with balloting spread over two days , voting early sunday was not expected to be particularly brisk .
around 50 people voted in the first half hour of polling at the lungatevere della farnesina station in rome , close to the vatican . " i voted for those who are defending our values : the family , education and security .
these values are not only religious values but of society in general , " said one nun who voted with around 30 others from her order after attending morning mass to celebrate palm sunday . berlusconi , 69 , has repeatedly called on voters to defend italy 's " christian identity " and family values against a perceived threat from prodi 's centre-left which includes communists who want legal recognition of same-sex couples . his centre-right bloc has come under fire in a vitriolic campaign which focused on italy 's dire economic performance , tax cuts and unemployment . the campaign was marked by a clash of styles between the suave and voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , and prodi 's more diffident , professorial approach . clear lines of division despite confusing ballot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messiah , emperor , unemployed ?
berlsuconi faces an uncertain vote berlusconi , in what analysts said was an attempt to focus voter attention on him during a media blitz , has memorably compared himself to jesus christ , napoleon , and used a vulgar epithet to describe left-wing voters . " i voted left to send berlusconi packing , " said daniele calente , a civil servant .
" but i 'm afraid his media bombardment might have made a difference , and all his lies . " " i 've always voted left but this time it 's more important than ever and i 'm convinced prodi ca n't lose , " said grazia , 55 , who voted with her husband . paolo , 40 , said he had plumped for the centre-left " because we have to get rid of berlusconi . " prodi takes slender lead into vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi can count on the anti-berlusconi vote prodi , a 66-year-old former eu commission president who began his career as a university professor , held a narrow lead in opinion polls before surveys were suspended under electoral law two weeks ago . however , up to 25 percent of voters were undecided going into the polls . millions of italians living abroad have been allowed to vote in a general election for the first time .
the foreign ministry reported a 42 percent " turnout " in the expatriate vote after collating the mailed ballots . berlusconi , the colorful 69-year-old prime minister who became the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , is hoping for a much higher turnout in traditional polling . " vote !
vote !
vote ! " trumpeted the banner headline of il giornale , the daily newspaper owned by berlusconi 's businessman brother paolo . higher turnout likely to favor berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting started slowly on sunday analysts say a high turnout is likely to favor his centre-right house of freedoms bloc , which includes his forza italia party , the national alliance of deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , and the northern league of umberto bossi . berlusconi has also made pre-electoral pacts with a slew of other parties , including a neo-fascist group led by alessandra mussolini . prodi leads a more disparate centre-left grouping , which includes the largest individual opposition party , the democrats of the left of piero fassino , the moderate margherita -lrb- daisy -rrb- party of francesco rutelli , and italy 's two communist parties . voters will choose 630 members in the lower house of parliament , the chamber of deputies , and 315 in the senate , under a proportional representation system which has recently been re-adopted after a law in december junked the old , mainly first-past-the-post , system . electors are being presented with a ballot paper indicating a blinding array of party symbols .

but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .
berlusconi was fighting for his political life sunday in the face of a groundswell of support for his rival romano prodi . prodi , dressed in a sober blue suit , cast his ballot at 10:00 utc with his wife flavia in his home city of bologna , northern italy .
" i slept well very well last night and today it 's sunny and people are voting calmly .
i hope everything goes as steadily and as serenely as possible , " said the former eu commission president . berlusconi , the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , was applauded by dozens of his supporters as he voted shortly after 1:00 pm in his home city of milan , accompanied by his 95-year-old mother , rosa bossi .
he made no public statements . turnout by midday , four hours after polling opened , was reported at 17.6 percent by the interior ministry .
total turnout in italy 's last general election five years ago was slightly more than 81 percent . as bells tolled across rome calling people to mass on a bright spring day , hardly anyone seemed to be thinking about the merits of berlusconi 's center-left challenger prodi . " we have to get rid of berlusconi .
that 's why i voted for the center left , " said daniele cialente , a 43-year-old civil servant . cristoforo martini said after casting his ballot : " i 've always voted for the left , but this time i 'm doing it really to defend democracy in my country .
berlusconi is a buffoon , on the verge of fascist . " in the industrialized north , a right-wing stronghold , the prime minister was apparently garnering plenty of " yes " votes . " berlusconi has done positive things for the family , " said monica bell 'oglio , a dental hygienist with two children in tow at a polling station in milan .

but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .
berlusconi was fighting for his political life sunday in the face of a groundswell of support for his rival romano prodi . prodi , dressed in a sober blue suit , cast his ballot at 10:00 utc with his wife flavia in his home city of bologna , northern italy .
" i slept well very well last night and today it 's sunny and people are voting calmly .
i hope everything goes as steadily and as serenely as possible , " said the former eu commission president . berlusconi , the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , was applauded by dozens of his supporters as he voted shortly after 1:00 pm in his home city of milan , accompanied by his 95-year-old mother , rosa bossi .
he made no public statements . turnout by midday , four hours after polling opened , was reported at 17.6 percent by the interior ministry .
total turnout in italy 's last general election five years ago was slightly more than 81 percent . as bells tolled across rome calling people to mass on a bright spring day , hardly anyone seemed to be thinking about the merits of berlusconi 's center-left challenger prodi . " we have to get rid of berlusconi .
that 's why i voted for the center left , " said daniele cialente , a 43-year-old civil servant . cristoforo martini said after casting his ballot : " i 've always voted for the left , but this time i 'm doing it really to defend democracy in my country .
berlusconi is a buffoon , on the verge of fascist . " in the industrialized north , a right-wing stronghold , the prime minister was apparently garnering plenty of " yes " votes . " berlusconi has done positive things for the family , " said monica bell 'oglio , a dental hygienist with two children in tow at a polling station in milan .
" and i think that as a business executive he has a spirit of initiative that is more appropriate for governing . " but even in milan , the self-made billionaire 's home town , dissenting voices could be heard . fabio fasanella , who works at an italian branch of the french bank bnp paribas , told reporters that he voted for berlusconi 's forza italia party " because i believe in their values . " he went on to add , however , that foreign minister gianfranco fini , head of the right-wing national alliance , the second largest partner in berlusconi 's coalition , may be " the man of the moment . " " he has more international vision .
he 's more credible overseas than berlusconi - he 's a serious man . " italians split over incumbent pm 's record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even right-wingers want berlusconi out back in rome , at a school in a southern suburb where polling stations reported a steady stream of voters , a young doctor who gave her name only as francesca was of the same view : " i 'm voting for the right , but not for berlusconi .
i 'm voting for the national alliance because i see myself as part of this ideology .
i 'm even for the death penalty . " then she added : " i hope gianfranco fini will have more votes than berlusconi and that he will be our new prime minister . " another roman voter , an engineer in his early 40s who gave his name only as edoardo , said : " i wo n't miss this chance to send the center-right coalition packing .
this coalition has carried out disastrous policies . " while he recognized that " there will be a lot of difficulties for the left if it wins , " he said : " let 's hope that if they signed a program they 'll try to respect it . " berlusconi 's power and approach a turn-off for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi surpassed himself with the " communists boil babies " comment edoardo 's wife stefania chimed in : " i do n't like politics , but i am for the weak .
i do n't like the shows of force that we have seen from the berlusconi government .
look at the job contracts , which are more and more precarious .
we 're going in the wrong direction - look what 's happening in france . " while unemployment has decreased under berlusconi , it is unstable for many .
in particular , one in two new-wage earners under 30 is on a short-term contract . some voiced indignation over berlusconi 's brash manner , especially his use of vulgarity at the expense of left-wing voters .
" even if i 'll be worse off than i am today , i voted against berlusconi .
i 'm indignant over the way he treats people , and calls them ' bloody idiots ' .
it 's unacceptable , " said 70-year-old anna after voting at a school on the outskirts of the capital . she was referring to the campaign 's most infamous quote , uttered last week by berlusconi to a conference of small business-owners : " i trust the intelligence of the italian people too much to believe there are so many bloody idiots around who would vote against their own best interests .

but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .
the iea also assumes a savings potential of up to 20 nuclear power plants , spread across the 30 countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . in addition , an efficient use of energy could reduce worldwide demand by 15 percent , according to the iea .
renewable energies such as sun , wind or water have to finally be seriously promoted and used , said paulitz . at least the share of nuclear energy in europe will not change significantly in the next 20 years . " one-third of the energy mix is a good size , " said wesselmann .
paulitz also does n't expect any major changes in the european nuclear sector . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .

" the temporary suspension of direct aid to the palestinian government is ... a very clear signal , " said one british official , adding that the " message from ministers will be an endorsement " of the eu commission 's decision . eu attempts to limit impact of suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu funds help to ease the strain of living in places like the gaza strip the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels , and the rest from individual eu governments . the money goes through a web of channels for a wide variety of purposes , from refugee aid to pure budgetary support , and working out exactly how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task . the eu is all too aware of the potential impact on the already battered local economy , and has vowed to do everything possible to limit the impact on ordinary palestinians , such as funneling more money through aid agencies . but one source said that the suspension decision could cut over 30 million euros , while others say that nearly half of eu aid is at risk . palestinian premier ismail haniya lashed out at the eu and us moves saturday , saying : " the decision of the west , the united states and the israeli occupation are unjust .
they aim at blackmailing us . " europeans reject claims of blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas remains on the eu 's list of terror organizations but the eu is clearly in no mood to appease the leadership of an organization which remains on its blacklist of terrorist organizations . " they should n't claim blackmail .
they do n't only live on international aid .
and we have been clear about our principles from the start , from before the elections .
they have n't been taken by surprise , " said a french source . he noted that the eu gave 120 million euros to the caretaker palestinian government shortly before the hamas-led cabinet took office . " we encouraged them by giving them 120 million just before the government was nominated .
we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

" the temporary suspension of direct aid to the palestinian government is ... a very clear signal , " said one british official , adding that the " message from ministers will be an endorsement " of the eu commission 's decision . eu attempts to limit impact of suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu funds help to ease the strain of living in places like the gaza strip the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels , and the rest from individual eu governments . the money goes through a web of channels for a wide variety of purposes , from refugee aid to pure budgetary support , and working out exactly how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task . the eu is all too aware of the potential impact on the already battered local economy , and has vowed to do everything possible to limit the impact on ordinary palestinians , such as funneling more money through aid agencies . but one source said that the suspension decision could cut over 30 million euros , while others say that nearly half of eu aid is at risk . palestinian premier ismail haniya lashed out at the eu and us moves saturday , saying : " the decision of the west , the united states and the israeli occupation are unjust .
they aim at blackmailing us . " europeans reject claims of blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas remains on the eu 's list of terror organizations but the eu is clearly in no mood to appease the leadership of an organization which remains on its blacklist of terrorist organizations . " they should n't claim blackmail .
they do n't only live on international aid .
and we have been clear about our principles from the start , from before the elections .
they have n't been taken by surprise , " said a french source . he noted that the eu gave 120 million euros to the caretaker palestinian government shortly before the hamas-led cabinet took office . " we encouraged them by giving them 120 million just before the government was nominated .
we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2006 nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german nuclear power plant in biblis has shown some defects nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .
the iea also assumes a savings potential of up to 20 nuclear power plants , spread across the 30 countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . in addition , an efficient use of energy could reduce worldwide demand by 15 percent , according to the iea .
renewable energies such as sun , wind or water have to finally be seriously promoted and used , said paulitz . at least the share of nuclear energy in europe will not change significantly in the next 20 years . " one-third of the energy mix is a good size , " said wesselmann .
paulitz also does n't expect any major changes in the european nuclear sector . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .

after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .

they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .

plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .
the iea also assumes a savings potential of up to 20 nuclear power plants , spread across the 30 countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . in addition , an efficient use of energy could reduce worldwide demand by 15 percent , according to the iea .

the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .

in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .

according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .

but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .
for the iea - the energy forum for 26 industrialized countries - economic competitiveness and environmental protection also play a role . " nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .
in the german city of gorleben , a facility is eventually supposed to be established . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loviisa plant in finland could soon find long-term storage nearby according to wesselmann , finland is also progressing in exploring and test drilling for a long-term storage site .
sweden , switzerland and france have at least begun to think about suitable locations , wesselmann said . " in the next 10 to 20 years , the first long-term storage in europe will take up operations , " wesselmann said .
the abandoned iron mine konrad near salzgitter in lower saxony is earmarked for low-level radioactive waste .
last month , a high court in lüneburg dismissed a case by affected citizens and communities . a nuclear catastrophe can be limited the safety of nuclear plants is also a decisive factor in this type of power . " there is no 100 percent safety in nuclear power plants , " wesselmann said .
" but they can be devised in a manner so that possible consequences of a catastrophic accident would remain limited to the plant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flamanville will be home to a new generation of nuclear power plants in france there are 444 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , 204 of them in europe .
currently , 23 new plants are being built , five of which in europe : three in russia and one each in romania and finland .
plans for new plants exist in france , britain , the netherlands and the three baltic states -lrb- estonia , latvia and lithuania -rrb- . worldwide , nuclear power makes up for 16 percent of power generation .
in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .
" uranium can be obtained tax-free , the risk reserve is tax-free and the insurance coverage is inadequate and therefore too cheap . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how does energy get into these power lines ?
according to a report by the prognos consultancy group , only 0.1 percent of the expected claim is insured .
the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .
the iea also assumes a savings potential of up to 20 nuclear power plants , spread across the 30 countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . in addition , an efficient use of energy could reduce worldwide demand by 15 percent , according to the iea .
renewable energies such as sun , wind or water have to finally be seriously promoted and used , said paulitz . at least the share of nuclear energy in europe will not change significantly in the next 20 years . " one-third of the energy mix is a good size , " said wesselmann .
paulitz also does n't expect any major changes in the european nuclear sector . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .

after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

the environmental implications also need to be considered . nuclear power is a sensitive and emotional issue , not only in germany .
with the upcoming 20th anniversary of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 , the topic has once again entered the public eye . " an advantage of nuclear power is its large energy security , " said christopher weßelmann , editor-in-chief of the trade magazine atw atomwirtschaft from the german nuclear sector . energy security is one of the three factors by which the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- measures energy policy .

" nuclear power plants can operate for several decades and there is sufficient uranium available for the next 60 years , " wesselmann said . those uranium deposits already discovered but not yet developed would even last for up to 400 years , he said . but henrik paulitz from the german branch of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said 60 years of uranium availability were too amply calculated .
yet , 20 years more or less was irrelevant . " uranium is an endless resource , " paulitz said . long-term storage needed for high-level radioactive waste " a structural decision for nuclear power affects entire generations , " paulitz said .
uranium waste radiated for several hundred thousand years .
for paulitz , the fact that the generation of nuclear power created less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels , such as oil or gas , carried little weight . so far , there is no long-term storage in the world for high-level radioactive waste .

in europe , it is significantly more , about one-third .
in germany , the share in 2005 was more than 26 percent , according to the german institute for economic research . is nuclear power really as inexpensive as it 's said to be ? the efficiency of a nuclear power plant also plays a role in how much demand there is for its generated energy .
the nuclear lobby calls nuclear energy itself one of the most inexpensive possibilities for energy supply . " in germany , nuclear power is highly privileged and subsidized , " ippnw 's paulitz said .

the general public has to come up for the final storage of nuclear waste . " these are all costs of nuclear energy , which are not considered in the price of nuclear power , " paulitz said .
instead of a few cents per kilowatt hour in generating costs , the price would have to be over two euros -lrb- $ 2.45 -rrb- , if these other costs were included , he said . efficient energy use is needed for paulitz , the solution for the energy supply lies in significantly saving energy .

first results are expected later that day . with balloting spread over two days , voting early sunday was not expected to be particularly brisk .
around 50 people voted in the first half hour of polling at the lungatevere della farnesina station in rome , close to the vatican . " i voted for those who are defending our values : the family , education and security .
these values are not only religious values but of society in general , " said one nun who voted with around 30 others from her order after attending morning mass to celebrate palm sunday . berlusconi , 69 , has repeatedly called on voters to defend italy 's " christian identity " and family values against a perceived threat from prodi 's centre-left which includes communists who want legal recognition of same-sex couples . his centre-right bloc has come under fire in a vitriolic campaign which focused on italy 's dire economic performance , tax cuts and unemployment . the campaign was marked by a clash of styles between the suave and voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , and prodi 's more diffident , professorial approach . clear lines of division despite confusing ballot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messiah , emperor , unemployed ?
berlsuconi faces an uncertain vote berlusconi , in what analysts said was an attempt to focus voter attention on him during a media blitz , has memorably compared himself to jesus christ , napoleon , and used a vulgar epithet to describe left-wing voters .

threatened with relegation and winless in their past five matches , duisburg president walter hellmich said he did n't have a choice in letting the trainer go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler had a lot to scream about in duisburg many reasons for being shown the door " jürgen kohler was one of the best players in germany in the last century but was unable to create a successful team spirit , " he said .
" you ca n't survive in the relegation battle without that . " the 10th coach to sent packing , it may be of little consolation that hellmich 's grounds were purely soccer related .
unlike kohler 's predecessor , norbert meier , who , after guiding duisburg back to the first division , got the boot in december for second-rate results as well as head butting a cologne player . things are looking good for stuttgart 's armin veh these days either .
after taking over for giovanni trapattoni , the italian maestro who was supposed to lead stuttgart to the champions league , nearly two months ago , veh might want to starting polishing his resume . veh knows he 'll need a positive result this week against nuremburg to fight off the naysayers , including stuttgart club chairman dieter hundt , who called the still-coach a " temporary solution .

" this condition ca n't continue over the long-term . " wolfgang wolf may not want to spend too much time thinking about long-term goals . at first glance , the kaiserslautern coach is an obvious choice for a trainer who is likely to be spending next season with a beer in front the tv .
kaiserslautern have booked the fewest points , have worst goal-difference and have generally played poorly over the past few weeks . second division despair but the club , which already sacked michael henke at the winter break , could have problems finding a person willing to take on the team if they are relegated - leaving wolf with the unenviable , albeit salaried , job of getting the " red devils " out of the despair that is second division bus trips across the country for a 90 minute game . should a player or coach need more motivation than playing in front of tiny crowds in the mini second division stadiums , a positive attitude can also help push a team out of the last three spots - at least that 's what mainz 05 coach jürgen klopp seems to be hoping . after a humiliating 3-0 loss to nuremburg last week , the pollyanna said he had plenty of reason to look on the bright side . " my team ca n't play like such crap two weeks in a row , " klopp said .
he can bet his boss will be looking to see that theory proved saturday against hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 13 games without a win , götz can be glad he only had to fix the pitch for a photo-op loss do n't automatically mean pink slips but there is proof , however minimal , that a coach can turn the situation around . falko götz passed on long-assumed title of 10th bundesliga trainer out the door to duisburg 's kohler and is currently standing comfortably in the hertha berlin coaching box despite the fact that he went 13 straight games without a win . then again , his team , now fighting for a uefa cup berth , was never in real danger of playing the likes of kickers offenbach and 1 .

threatened with relegation and winless in their past five matches , duisburg president walter hellmich said he did n't have a choice in letting the trainer go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler had a lot to scream about in duisburg many reasons for being shown the door " jürgen kohler was one of the best players in germany in the last century but was unable to create a successful team spirit , " he said .
" you ca n't survive in the relegation battle without that . " the 10th coach to sent packing , it may be of little consolation that hellmich 's grounds were purely soccer related .
unlike kohler 's predecessor , norbert meier , who , after guiding duisburg back to the first division , got the boot in december for second-rate results as well as head butting a cologne player . things are looking good for stuttgart 's armin veh these days either .
after taking over for giovanni trapattoni , the italian maestro who was supposed to lead stuttgart to the champions league , nearly two months ago , veh might want to starting polishing his resume . veh knows he 'll need a positive result this week against nuremburg to fight off the naysayers , including stuttgart club chairman dieter hundt , who called the still-coach a " temporary solution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh knows there are rough times ahead for stuttgart high expectations come crashing to the ground " it 's not so easy when there is so much unrest in the team , " veh said .
" this condition ca n't continue over the long-term . " wolfgang wolf may not want to spend too much time thinking about long-term goals . at first glance , the kaiserslautern coach is an obvious choice for a trainer who is likely to be spending next season with a beer in front the tv .
kaiserslautern have booked the fewest points , have worst goal-difference and have generally played poorly over the past few weeks . second division despair but the club , which already sacked michael henke at the winter break , could have problems finding a person willing to take on the team if they are relegated - leaving wolf with the unenviable , albeit salaried , job of getting the " red devils " out of the despair that is second division bus trips across the country for a 90 minute game . should a player or coach need more motivation than playing in front of tiny crowds in the mini second division stadiums , a positive attitude can also help push a team out of the last three spots - at least that 's what mainz 05 coach jürgen klopp seems to be hoping . after a humiliating 3-0 loss to nuremburg last week , the pollyanna said he had plenty of reason to look on the bright side . " my team ca n't play like such crap two weeks in a row , " klopp said .
he can bet his boss will be looking to see that theory proved saturday against hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 13 games without a win , götz can be glad he only had to fix the pitch for a photo-op loss do n't automatically mean pink slips but there is proof , however minimal , that a coach can turn the situation around . falko götz passed on long-assumed title of 10th bundesliga trainer out the door to duisburg 's kohler and is currently standing comfortably in the hertha berlin coaching box despite the fact that he went 13 straight games without a win . then again , his team , now fighting for a uefa cup berth , was never in real danger of playing the likes of kickers offenbach and 1 .

but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .
berlusconi was fighting for his political life sunday in the face of a groundswell of support for his rival romano prodi . prodi , dressed in a sober blue suit , cast his ballot at 10:00 utc with his wife flavia in his home city of bologna , northern italy .
" i slept well very well last night and today it 's sunny and people are voting calmly .
i hope everything goes as steadily and as serenely as possible , " said the former eu commission president . berlusconi , the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , was applauded by dozens of his supporters as he voted shortly after 1:00 pm in his home city of milan , accompanied by his 95-year-old mother , rosa bossi .
he made no public statements . turnout by midday , four hours after polling opened , was reported at 17.6 percent by the interior ministry .
total turnout in italy 's last general election five years ago was slightly more than 81 percent . as bells tolled across rome calling people to mass on a bright spring day , hardly anyone seemed to be thinking about the merits of berlusconi 's center-left challenger prodi . " we have to get rid of berlusconi .
that 's why i voted for the center left , " said daniele cialente , a 43-year-old civil servant . cristoforo martini said after casting his ballot : " i 've always voted for the left , but this time i 'm doing it really to defend democracy in my country .
berlusconi is a buffoon , on the verge of fascist . " in the industrialized north , a right-wing stronghold , the prime minister was apparently garnering plenty of " yes " votes . " berlusconi has done positive things for the family , " said monica bell 'oglio , a dental hygienist with two children in tow at a polling station in milan .
" and i think that as a business executive he has a spirit of initiative that is more appropriate for governing . " but even in milan , the self-made billionaire 's home town , dissenting voices could be heard . fabio fasanella , who works at an italian branch of the french bank bnp paribas , told reporters that he voted for berlusconi 's forza italia party " because i believe in their values . " he went on to add , however , that foreign minister gianfranco fini , head of the right-wing national alliance , the second largest partner in berlusconi 's coalition , may be " the man of the moment . " " he has more international vision .
he 's more credible overseas than berlusconi - he 's a serious man . " italians split over incumbent pm 's record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even right-wingers want berlusconi out back in rome , at a school in a southern suburb where polling stations reported a steady stream of voters , a young doctor who gave her name only as francesca was of the same view : " i 'm voting for the right , but not for berlusconi .
i 'm voting for the national alliance because i see myself as part of this ideology .
i 'm even for the death penalty . " then she added : " i hope gianfranco fini will have more votes than berlusconi and that he will be our new prime minister . " another roman voter , an engineer in his early 40s who gave his name only as edoardo , said : " i wo n't miss this chance to send the center-right coalition packing .
this coalition has carried out disastrous policies . " while he recognized that " there will be a lot of difficulties for the left if it wins , " he said : " let 's hope that if they signed a program they 'll try to respect it . " berlusconi 's power and approach a turn-off for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi surpassed himself with the " communists boil babies " comment edoardo 's wife stefania chimed in : " i do n't like politics , but i am for the weak .
i do n't like the shows of force that we have seen from the berlusconi government .
look at the job contracts , which are more and more precarious .
we 're going in the wrong direction - look what 's happening in france . " while unemployment has decreased under berlusconi , it is unstable for many .
in particular , one in two new-wage earners under 30 is on a short-term contract . some voiced indignation over berlusconi 's brash manner , especially his use of vulgarity at the expense of left-wing voters .
" even if i 'll be worse off than i am today , i voted against berlusconi .
i 'm indignant over the way he treats people , and calls them ' bloody idiots ' .
it 's unacceptable , " said 70-year-old anna after voting at a school on the outskirts of the capital . she was referring to the campaign 's most infamous quote , uttered last week by berlusconi to a conference of small business-owners : " i trust the intelligence of the italian people too much to believe there are so many bloody idiots around who would vote against their own best interests .

but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .
berlusconi was fighting for his political life sunday in the face of a groundswell of support for his rival romano prodi . prodi , dressed in a sober blue suit , cast his ballot at 10:00 utc with his wife flavia in his home city of bologna , northern italy .
" i slept well very well last night and today it 's sunny and people are voting calmly .
i hope everything goes as steadily and as serenely as possible , " said the former eu commission president . berlusconi , the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , was applauded by dozens of his supporters as he voted shortly after 1:00 pm in his home city of milan , accompanied by his 95-year-old mother , rosa bossi .
he made no public statements . turnout by midday , four hours after polling opened , was reported at 17.6 percent by the interior ministry .
total turnout in italy 's last general election five years ago was slightly more than 81 percent . as bells tolled across rome calling people to mass on a bright spring day , hardly anyone seemed to be thinking about the merits of berlusconi 's center-left challenger prodi . " we have to get rid of berlusconi .
that 's why i voted for the center left , " said daniele cialente , a 43-year-old civil servant . cristoforo martini said after casting his ballot : " i 've always voted for the left , but this time i 'm doing it really to defend democracy in my country .
berlusconi is a buffoon , on the verge of fascist . " in the industrialized north , a right-wing stronghold , the prime minister was apparently garnering plenty of " yes " votes . " berlusconi has done positive things for the family , " said monica bell 'oglio , a dental hygienist with two children in tow at a polling station in milan .
" and i think that as a business executive he has a spirit of initiative that is more appropriate for governing . " but even in milan , the self-made billionaire 's home town , dissenting voices could be heard . fabio fasanella , who works at an italian branch of the french bank bnp paribas , told reporters that he voted for berlusconi 's forza italia party " because i believe in their values . " he went on to add , however , that foreign minister gianfranco fini , head of the right-wing national alliance , the second largest partner in berlusconi 's coalition , may be " the man of the moment . " " he has more international vision .
he 's more credible overseas than berlusconi - he 's a serious man . " italians split over incumbent pm 's record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even right-wingers want berlusconi out back in rome , at a school in a southern suburb where polling stations reported a steady stream of voters , a young doctor who gave her name only as francesca was of the same view : " i 'm voting for the right , but not for berlusconi .
i 'm voting for the national alliance because i see myself as part of this ideology .
i 'm even for the death penalty . " then she added : " i hope gianfranco fini will have more votes than berlusconi and that he will be our new prime minister . " another roman voter , an engineer in his early 40s who gave his name only as edoardo , said : " i wo n't miss this chance to send the center-right coalition packing .
this coalition has carried out disastrous policies . " while he recognized that " there will be a lot of difficulties for the left if it wins , " he said : " let 's hope that if they signed a program they 'll try to respect it . " berlusconi 's power and approach a turn-off for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi surpassed himself with the " communists boil babies " comment edoardo 's wife stefania chimed in : " i do n't like politics , but i am for the weak .
i do n't like the shows of force that we have seen from the berlusconi government .
look at the job contracts , which are more and more precarious .
we 're going in the wrong direction - look what 's happening in france . " while unemployment has decreased under berlusconi , it is unstable for many .
in particular , one in two new-wage earners under 30 is on a short-term contract . some voiced indignation over berlusconi 's brash manner , especially his use of vulgarity at the expense of left-wing voters .
" even if i 'll be worse off than i am today , i voted against berlusconi .
i 'm indignant over the way he treats people , and calls them ' bloody idiots ' .
it 's unacceptable , " said 70-year-old anna after voting at a school on the outskirts of the capital . she was referring to the campaign 's most infamous quote , uttered last week by berlusconi to a conference of small business-owners : " i trust the intelligence of the italian people too much to believe there are so many bloody idiots around who would vote against their own best interests .

we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

" the temporary suspension of direct aid to the palestinian government is ... a very clear signal , " said one british official , adding that the " message from ministers will be an endorsement " of the eu commission 's decision . eu attempts to limit impact of suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu funds help to ease the strain of living in places like the gaza strip the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels , and the rest from individual eu governments . the money goes through a web of channels for a wide variety of purposes , from refugee aid to pure budgetary support , and working out exactly how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task . the eu is all too aware of the potential impact on the already battered local economy , and has vowed to do everything possible to limit the impact on ordinary palestinians , such as funneling more money through aid agencies . but one source said that the suspension decision could cut over 30 million euros , while others say that nearly half of eu aid is at risk . palestinian premier ismail haniya lashed out at the eu and us moves saturday , saying : " the decision of the west , the united states and the israeli occupation are unjust .
they aim at blackmailing us . " europeans reject claims of blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas remains on the eu 's list of terror organizations but the eu is clearly in no mood to appease the leadership of an organization which remains on its blacklist of terrorist organizations . " they should n't claim blackmail .
they do n't only live on international aid .
and we have been clear about our principles from the start , from before the elections .
they have n't been taken by surprise , " said a french source . he noted that the eu gave 120 million euros to the caretaker palestinian government shortly before the hamas-led cabinet took office . " we encouraged them by giving them 120 million just before the government was nominated .
we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

" the temporary suspension of direct aid to the palestinian government is ... a very clear signal , " said one british official , adding that the " message from ministers will be an endorsement " of the eu commission 's decision . eu attempts to limit impact of suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu funds help to ease the strain of living in places like the gaza strip the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels , and the rest from individual eu governments . the money goes through a web of channels for a wide variety of purposes , from refugee aid to pure budgetary support , and working out exactly how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task . the eu is all too aware of the potential impact on the already battered local economy , and has vowed to do everything possible to limit the impact on ordinary palestinians , such as funneling more money through aid agencies . but one source said that the suspension decision could cut over 30 million euros , while others say that nearly half of eu aid is at risk . palestinian premier ismail haniya lashed out at the eu and us moves saturday , saying : " the decision of the west , the united states and the israeli occupation are unjust .
they aim at blackmailing us . " europeans reject claims of blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas remains on the eu 's list of terror organizations but the eu is clearly in no mood to appease the leadership of an organization which remains on its blacklist of terrorist organizations . " they should n't claim blackmail .
they do n't only live on international aid .
and we have been clear about our principles from the start , from before the elections .
they have n't been taken by surprise , " said a french source . he noted that the eu gave 120 million euros to the caretaker palestinian government shortly before the hamas-led cabinet took office . " we encouraged them by giving them 120 million just before the government was nominated .
we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2006 election begins slowly as italy starts two days of voting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians face a confusing array of symbols and candidates in italy 's disparate election ballot conservative prime minister silvio berlusconi 's job was on the line sunday , facing a stiff challenge from his centre-left rival romano prodi as voters went to the polls in italy 's first general election for five years . some 60,000 polling stations around the country opened at 8:00 am -lrb- 0600 gmt -rrb- , beginning two days of polling which will end monday at 3:00 pm .
first results are expected later that day . with balloting spread over two days , voting early sunday was not expected to be particularly brisk .
around 50 people voted in the first half hour of polling at the lungatevere della farnesina station in rome , close to the vatican . " i voted for those who are defending our values : the family , education and security .
these values are not only religious values but of society in general , " said one nun who voted with around 30 others from her order after attending morning mass to celebrate palm sunday . berlusconi , 69 , has repeatedly called on voters to defend italy 's " christian identity " and family values against a perceived threat from prodi 's centre-left which includes communists who want legal recognition of same-sex couples . his centre-right bloc has come under fire in a vitriolic campaign which focused on italy 's dire economic performance , tax cuts and unemployment . the campaign was marked by a clash of styles between the suave and voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , and prodi 's more diffident , professorial approach . clear lines of division despite confusing ballot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messiah , emperor , unemployed ?
berlsuconi faces an uncertain vote berlusconi , in what analysts said was an attempt to focus voter attention on him during a media blitz , has memorably compared himself to jesus christ , napoleon , and used a vulgar epithet to describe left-wing voters . " i voted left to send berlusconi packing , " said daniele calente , a civil servant .
" but i 'm afraid his media bombardment might have made a difference , and all his lies . " " i 've always voted left but this time it 's more important than ever and i 'm convinced prodi ca n't lose , " said grazia , 55 , who voted with her husband . paolo , 40 , said he had plumped for the centre-left " because we have to get rid of berlusconi . " prodi takes slender lead into vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi can count on the anti-berlusconi vote prodi , a 66-year-old former eu commission president who began his career as a university professor , held a narrow lead in opinion polls before surveys were suspended under electoral law two weeks ago . however , up to 25 percent of voters were undecided going into the polls . millions of italians living abroad have been allowed to vote in a general election for the first time .
the foreign ministry reported a 42 percent " turnout " in the expatriate vote after collating the mailed ballots . berlusconi , the colorful 69-year-old prime minister who became the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , is hoping for a much higher turnout in traditional polling . " vote !
vote !
vote ! " trumpeted the banner headline of il giornale , the daily newspaper owned by berlusconi 's businessman brother paolo . higher turnout likely to favor berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting started slowly on sunday analysts say a high turnout is likely to favor his centre-right house of freedoms bloc , which includes his forza italia party , the national alliance of deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , and the northern league of umberto bossi . berlusconi has also made pre-electoral pacts with a slew of other parties , including a neo-fascist group led by alessandra mussolini . prodi leads a more disparate centre-left grouping , which includes the largest individual opposition party , the democrats of the left of piero fassino , the moderate margherita -lrb- daisy -rrb- party of francesco rutelli , and italy 's two communist parties . voters will choose 630 members in the lower house of parliament , the chamber of deputies , and 315 in the senate , under a proportional representation system which has recently been re-adopted after a law in december junked the old , mainly first-past-the-post , system . electors are being presented with a ballot paper indicating a blinding array of party symbols .
they are casting their ballots not for individuals , but for parties .
the more votes a party gets , the more members on its list win seats in the new parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian elections : the foreign policy question berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ?
-lrb- april 9 , 2006 -rrb- italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .
-lrb- april 7 , 2006 -rrb- the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .
-lrb- april 6 , 2006 -rrb- italy takes to the polls the italians are ready to cast their ballots .

first results are expected later that day . with balloting spread over two days , voting early sunday was not expected to be particularly brisk .
around 50 people voted in the first half hour of polling at the lungatevere della farnesina station in rome , close to the vatican . " i voted for those who are defending our values : the family , education and security .
these values are not only religious values but of society in general , " said one nun who voted with around 30 others from her order after attending morning mass to celebrate palm sunday . berlusconi , 69 , has repeatedly called on voters to defend italy 's " christian identity " and family values against a perceived threat from prodi 's centre-left which includes communists who want legal recognition of same-sex couples . his centre-right bloc has come under fire in a vitriolic campaign which focused on italy 's dire economic performance , tax cuts and unemployment . the campaign was marked by a clash of styles between the suave and voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , and prodi 's more diffident , professorial approach . clear lines of division despite confusing ballot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messiah , emperor , unemployed ?
berlsuconi faces an uncertain vote berlusconi , in what analysts said was an attempt to focus voter attention on him during a media blitz , has memorably compared himself to jesus christ , napoleon , and used a vulgar epithet to describe left-wing voters . " i voted left to send berlusconi packing , " said daniele calente , a civil servant .
" but i 'm afraid his media bombardment might have made a difference , and all his lies . " " i 've always voted left but this time it 's more important than ever and i 'm convinced prodi ca n't lose , " said grazia , 55 , who voted with her husband . paolo , 40 , said he had plumped for the centre-left " because we have to get rid of berlusconi . " prodi takes slender lead into vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi can count on the anti-berlusconi vote prodi , a 66-year-old former eu commission president who began his career as a university professor , held a narrow lead in opinion polls before surveys were suspended under electoral law two weeks ago . however , up to 25 percent of voters were undecided going into the polls . millions of italians living abroad have been allowed to vote in a general election for the first time .
the foreign ministry reported a 42 percent " turnout " in the expatriate vote after collating the mailed ballots . berlusconi , the colorful 69-year-old prime minister who became the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , is hoping for a much higher turnout in traditional polling . " vote !
vote !
vote ! " trumpeted the banner headline of il giornale , the daily newspaper owned by berlusconi 's businessman brother paolo . higher turnout likely to favor berlusconi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting started slowly on sunday analysts say a high turnout is likely to favor his centre-right house of freedoms bloc , which includes his forza italia party , the national alliance of deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , and the northern league of umberto bossi . berlusconi has also made pre-electoral pacts with a slew of other parties , including a neo-fascist group led by alessandra mussolini . prodi leads a more disparate centre-left grouping , which includes the largest individual opposition party , the democrats of the left of piero fassino , the moderate margherita -lrb- daisy -rrb- party of francesco rutelli , and italy 's two communist parties . voters will choose 630 members in the lower house of parliament , the chamber of deputies , and 315 in the senate , under a proportional representation system which has recently been re-adopted after a law in december junked the old , mainly first-past-the-post , system . electors are being presented with a ballot paper indicating a blinding array of party symbols .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2006 italians not voting for prodi but against berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi could ride a wave of anti-berlusconi sentiment to victory the votes on the first day of the italian elections look to be favoring center-left candidate romano prodi .
but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .
berlusconi was fighting for his political life sunday in the face of a groundswell of support for his rival romano prodi . prodi , dressed in a sober blue suit , cast his ballot at 10:00 utc with his wife flavia in his home city of bologna , northern italy .
" i slept well very well last night and today it 's sunny and people are voting calmly .
i hope everything goes as steadily and as serenely as possible , " said the former eu commission president . berlusconi , the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , was applauded by dozens of his supporters as he voted shortly after 1:00 pm in his home city of milan , accompanied by his 95-year-old mother , rosa bossi .
he made no public statements . turnout by midday , four hours after polling opened , was reported at 17.6 percent by the interior ministry .
total turnout in italy 's last general election five years ago was slightly more than 81 percent . as bells tolled across rome calling people to mass on a bright spring day , hardly anyone seemed to be thinking about the merits of berlusconi 's center-left challenger prodi . " we have to get rid of berlusconi .
that 's why i voted for the center left , " said daniele cialente , a 43-year-old civil servant . cristoforo martini said after casting his ballot : " i 've always voted for the left , but this time i 'm doing it really to defend democracy in my country .
berlusconi is a buffoon , on the verge of fascist . " in the industrialized north , a right-wing stronghold , the prime minister was apparently garnering plenty of " yes " votes . " berlusconi has done positive things for the family , " said monica bell 'oglio , a dental hygienist with two children in tow at a polling station in milan .
" and i think that as a business executive he has a spirit of initiative that is more appropriate for governing . " but even in milan , the self-made billionaire 's home town , dissenting voices could be heard . fabio fasanella , who works at an italian branch of the french bank bnp paribas , told reporters that he voted for berlusconi 's forza italia party " because i believe in their values . " he went on to add , however , that foreign minister gianfranco fini , head of the right-wing national alliance , the second largest partner in berlusconi 's coalition , may be " the man of the moment . " " he has more international vision .
he 's more credible overseas than berlusconi - he 's a serious man . " italians split over incumbent pm 's record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even right-wingers want berlusconi out back in rome , at a school in a southern suburb where polling stations reported a steady stream of voters , a young doctor who gave her name only as francesca was of the same view : " i 'm voting for the right , but not for berlusconi .
i 'm voting for the national alliance because i see myself as part of this ideology .
i 'm even for the death penalty . " then she added : " i hope gianfranco fini will have more votes than berlusconi and that he will be our new prime minister . " another roman voter , an engineer in his early 40s who gave his name only as edoardo , said : " i wo n't miss this chance to send the center-right coalition packing .
this coalition has carried out disastrous policies . " while he recognized that " there will be a lot of difficulties for the left if it wins , " he said : " let 's hope that if they signed a program they 'll try to respect it . " berlusconi 's power and approach a turn-off for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi surpassed himself with the " communists boil babies " comment edoardo 's wife stefania chimed in : " i do n't like politics , but i am for the weak .
i do n't like the shows of force that we have seen from the berlusconi government .
look at the job contracts , which are more and more precarious .
we 're going in the wrong direction - look what 's happening in france . " while unemployment has decreased under berlusconi , it is unstable for many .
in particular , one in two new-wage earners under 30 is on a short-term contract . some voiced indignation over berlusconi 's brash manner , especially his use of vulgarity at the expense of left-wing voters .
" even if i 'll be worse off than i am today , i voted against berlusconi .
i 'm indignant over the way he treats people , and calls them ' bloody idiots ' .
it 's unacceptable , " said 70-year-old anna after voting at a school on the outskirts of the capital . she was referring to the campaign 's most infamous quote , uttered last week by berlusconi to a conference of small business-owners : " i trust the intelligence of the italian people too much to believe there are so many bloody idiots around who would vote against their own best interests .

they aim at blackmailing us .

we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.04.2006 bestselling german-jewish author satirizes the holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin author edgar hilsenrath just turned 80 satirizing the holocaust has long been a taboo theme in germany .
after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere .

they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.04.2006 italians not voting for prodi but against berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi could ride a wave of anti-berlusconi sentiment to victory the votes on the first day of the italian elections look to be favoring center-left candidate romano prodi .
but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .
berlusconi was fighting for his political life sunday in the face of a groundswell of support for his rival romano prodi . prodi , dressed in a sober blue suit , cast his ballot at 10:00 utc with his wife flavia in his home city of bologna , northern italy .
" i slept well very well last night and today it 's sunny and people are voting calmly .
i hope everything goes as steadily and as serenely as possible , " said the former eu commission president . berlusconi , the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , was applauded by dozens of his supporters as he voted shortly after 1:00 pm in his home city of milan , accompanied by his 95-year-old mother , rosa bossi .
he made no public statements . turnout by midday , four hours after polling opened , was reported at 17.6 percent by the interior ministry .
total turnout in italy 's last general election five years ago was slightly more than 81 percent . as bells tolled across rome calling people to mass on a bright spring day , hardly anyone seemed to be thinking about the merits of berlusconi 's center-left challenger prodi . " we have to get rid of berlusconi .
that 's why i voted for the center left , " said daniele cialente , a 43-year-old civil servant . cristoforo martini said after casting his ballot : " i 've always voted for the left , but this time i 'm doing it really to defend democracy in my country .
berlusconi is a buffoon , on the verge of fascist . " in the industrialized north , a right-wing stronghold , the prime minister was apparently garnering plenty of " yes " votes . " berlusconi has done positive things for the family , " said monica bell 'oglio , a dental hygienist with two children in tow at a polling station in milan .
" and i think that as a business executive he has a spirit of initiative that is more appropriate for governing . " but even in milan , the self-made billionaire 's home town , dissenting voices could be heard . fabio fasanella , who works at an italian branch of the french bank bnp paribas , told reporters that he voted for berlusconi 's forza italia party " because i believe in their values . " he went on to add , however , that foreign minister gianfranco fini , head of the right-wing national alliance , the second largest partner in berlusconi 's coalition , may be " the man of the moment . " " he has more international vision .
he 's more credible overseas than berlusconi - he 's a serious man . " italians split over incumbent pm 's record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even right-wingers want berlusconi out back in rome , at a school in a southern suburb where polling stations reported a steady stream of voters , a young doctor who gave her name only as francesca was of the same view : " i 'm voting for the right , but not for berlusconi .
i 'm voting for the national alliance because i see myself as part of this ideology .
i 'm even for the death penalty . " then she added : " i hope gianfranco fini will have more votes than berlusconi and that he will be our new prime minister . " another roman voter , an engineer in his early 40s who gave his name only as edoardo , said : " i wo n't miss this chance to send the center-right coalition packing .

but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi . observers would be forgiven for thinking that italians were voting sunday in a referendum on prime minister silvio berlusconi , rather than a parliamentary election .
berlusconi was fighting for his political life sunday in the face of a groundswell of support for his rival romano prodi . prodi , dressed in a sober blue suit , cast his ballot at 10:00 utc with his wife flavia in his home city of bologna , northern italy .
" i slept well very well last night and today it 's sunny and people are voting calmly .
i hope everything goes as steadily and as serenely as possible , " said the former eu commission president . berlusconi , the first prime minister to take a government to its full term in italy since world war ii , was applauded by dozens of his supporters as he voted shortly after 1:00 pm in his home city of milan , accompanied by his 95-year-old mother , rosa bossi .
he made no public statements . turnout by midday , four hours after polling opened , was reported at 17.6 percent by the interior ministry .
total turnout in italy 's last general election five years ago was slightly more than 81 percent . as bells tolled across rome calling people to mass on a bright spring day , hardly anyone seemed to be thinking about the merits of berlusconi 's center-left challenger prodi . " we have to get rid of berlusconi .
that 's why i voted for the center left , " said daniele cialente , a 43-year-old civil servant . cristoforo martini said after casting his ballot : " i 've always voted for the left , but this time i 'm doing it really to defend democracy in my country .
berlusconi is a buffoon , on the verge of fascist . " in the industrialized north , a right-wing stronghold , the prime minister was apparently garnering plenty of " yes " votes . " berlusconi has done positive things for the family , " said monica bell 'oglio , a dental hygienist with two children in tow at a polling station in milan .
" and i think that as a business executive he has a spirit of initiative that is more appropriate for governing . " but even in milan , the self-made billionaire 's home town , dissenting voices could be heard . fabio fasanella , who works at an italian branch of the french bank bnp paribas , told reporters that he voted for berlusconi 's forza italia party " because i believe in their values . " he went on to add , however , that foreign minister gianfranco fini , head of the right-wing national alliance , the second largest partner in berlusconi 's coalition , may be " the man of the moment . " " he has more international vision .
he 's more credible overseas than berlusconi - he 's a serious man . " italians split over incumbent pm 's record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even right-wingers want berlusconi out back in rome , at a school in a southern suburb where polling stations reported a steady stream of voters , a young doctor who gave her name only as francesca was of the same view : " i 'm voting for the right , but not for berlusconi .

" the temporary suspension of direct aid to the palestinian government is ... a very clear signal , " said one british official , adding that the " message from ministers will be an endorsement " of the eu commission 's decision . eu attempts to limit impact of suspension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu funds help to ease the strain of living in places like the gaza strip the eu gives about 500 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- a year to the palestinian authority , about half of it collectively through brussels , and the rest from individual eu governments . the money goes through a web of channels for a wide variety of purposes , from refugee aid to pure budgetary support , and working out exactly how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task . the eu is all too aware of the potential impact on the already battered local economy , and has vowed to do everything possible to limit the impact on ordinary palestinians , such as funneling more money through aid agencies . but one source said that the suspension decision could cut over 30 million euros , while others say that nearly half of eu aid is at risk . palestinian premier ismail haniya lashed out at the eu and us moves saturday , saying : " the decision of the west , the united states and the israeli occupation are unjust .
they aim at blackmailing us . " europeans reject claims of blackmail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas remains on the eu 's list of terror organizations but the eu is clearly in no mood to appease the leadership of an organization which remains on its blacklist of terrorist organizations . " they should n't claim blackmail .
they do n't only live on international aid .
and we have been clear about our principles from the start , from before the elections .
they have n't been taken by surprise , " said a french source . he noted that the eu gave 120 million euros to the caretaker palestinian government shortly before the hamas-led cabinet took office . " we encouraged them by giving them 120 million just before the government was nominated .
we knew that part of the aid would still be in the pipeline " when the new government took office , he said . belarus sanctions also on the table at eu meeting while the palestinian question will dominate monday 's eu talks , other issues on their plate include the cloudy situation in ukraine after recent ballots , and the re-election of authoritarian belarus leader alexander lukashenko . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is also likely to feel the pinch of eu sanctions the foreign ministers are widely expected to increase pressure on minsk by lengthening a list of people banned from traveling to the eu , including lukashenko himself . but they will likely stop short of taking decisions to freeze assets linked to the ex-soviet country 's regime , although one official said : " we hope that there will be agreement on that before too long .

threatened with relegation and winless in their past five matches , duisburg president walter hellmich said he did n't have a choice in letting the trainer go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler had a lot to scream about in duisburg many reasons for being shown the door " jürgen kohler was one of the best players in germany in the last century but was unable to create a successful team spirit , " he said .
" you ca n't survive in the relegation battle without that . " the 10th coach to sent packing , it may be of little consolation that hellmich 's grounds were purely soccer related .
unlike kohler 's predecessor , norbert meier , who , after guiding duisburg back to the first division , got the boot in december for second-rate results as well as head butting a cologne player . things are looking good for stuttgart 's armin veh these days either .
after taking over for giovanni trapattoni , the italian maestro who was supposed to lead stuttgart to the champions league , nearly two months ago , veh might want to starting polishing his resume . veh knows he 'll need a positive result this week against nuremburg to fight off the naysayers , including stuttgart club chairman dieter hundt , who called the still-coach a " temporary solution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh knows there are rough times ahead for stuttgart high expectations come crashing to the ground " it 's not so easy when there is so much unrest in the team , " veh said .
" this condition ca n't continue over the long-term . " wolfgang wolf may not want to spend too much time thinking about long-term goals . at first glance , the kaiserslautern coach is an obvious choice for a trainer who is likely to be spending next season with a beer in front the tv .
kaiserslautern have booked the fewest points , have worst goal-difference and have generally played poorly over the past few weeks . second division despair but the club , which already sacked michael henke at the winter break , could have problems finding a person willing to take on the team if they are relegated - leaving wolf with the unenviable , albeit salaried , job of getting the " red devils " out of the despair that is second division bus trips across the country for a 90 minute game . should a player or coach need more motivation than playing in front of tiny crowds in the mini second division stadiums , a positive attitude can also help push a team out of the last three spots - at least that 's what mainz 05 coach jürgen klopp seems to be hoping . after a humiliating 3-0 loss to nuremburg last week , the pollyanna said he had plenty of reason to look on the bright side . " my team ca n't play like such crap two weeks in a row , " klopp said .
he can bet his boss will be looking to see that theory proved saturday against hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 13 games without a win , götz can be glad he only had to fix the pitch for a photo-op loss do n't automatically mean pink slips but there is proof , however minimal , that a coach can turn the situation around . falko götz passed on long-assumed title of 10th bundesliga trainer out the door to duisburg 's kohler and is currently standing comfortably in the hertha berlin coaching box despite the fact that he went 13 straight games without a win . then again , his team , now fighting for a uefa cup berth , was never in real danger of playing the likes of kickers offenbach and 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.04.2006 bestselling german-jewish author satirizes the holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin author edgar hilsenrath just turned 80 satirizing the holocaust has long been a taboo theme in germany .
after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ? germany is the land of his birth , but it has been a struggle to achieve recognition in his home country .
edgar hilsenrath , 80 , a holocaust survivor whose novels have sold in the millions in the united states and western europe , makes german publishers feel uneasy .
they say his works are " too gruesome , too satirical and too vulgar " . nonetheless , hilsenrath , author of the nazi who lived as a jew , the break-out novel which catapulted him to prominence in the 1970s , was forced to flee the nazis in 1938 , but returned to germany in 1975 and has lived in berlin ever since . his latest work , berlin endstation to be published by dittrich verlag this may , is an autobiographical novel about returning from new york to a post-war berlin , divided by the wall . autobiographical threads run through most of hilsenrath 's works .
his novels , which he writes in his native german , have been translated into many languages in over 20 countries .
the multi-lingual author says that he can only be a scribe in his mother tongue , which makes the popularity of his translated works abroad seem even more ironic . uncomfortable topics the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel once praised the the nazi who lived as a jew for its depiction of a horrific era with sharp wit .
hilsenrath has also won plaudits from germany ´ s literary giant , heinrich böll .
the satire , which has dashes of slapstick , is about an ss mass murderer , who assumes the identity of one of his jewish victims , when the death camps are liberated at the end of the war . although a bestseller in the united states , it was not released in the original german until six years later .
" the publishing houses here said that the german people just were n't ready for it yet .
they did n't like the language , they did n't like the open sexuality " , hilsenrath told der spiegel last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilsenrath at the frankfurt book fair in 1978 for the release of his book night a novel hilsenrath 's debut novel night ; a novel , was reprinted after the success of the nazi who lived as a jew .
the story is an unflinching account of survival in a ukrainian ghetto , based on his family 's deportation to the then romanian ghetto of mogilyov-podolski in 1941.when the ghettoes were liberated by the advancing red army in 1944 , the 18-year-old hilsenrath journeyed to palestine by way of bucharest . night ; a novel , first published in english translation in 1954 was an instant success , but it took a decade to be released in the original german , with a first run of only 1250 copies . in an interview with der spiegel , hilsenrath mused about why his works have n't taken off in germany , as they have elsewhere . " i have a rather perverse take on the events of the holocaust .
in germany people want to make up to the jews for what happened by idealizing them .
the jews in the ghetto were every bit as imperfect as human beings anywhere else " , he said . autobiographical threads liberation came at a price for survivors on the eastern front , and for young men over 18 , that meant avoiding conscription into the soviet army .
the adventures of ruben jablonski , published in 1997 , is based on hilsenrath 's own narrow escape with fake identity papers at the end of the war . in bulgaria , though , hisenrath and a delegation of zionists were arrested by the russians and interned for two months before being freed by david ben gurion , a founder of the israeli state and later its first prime minister . palestine only became a temporary haven for the maverick author , who could not adapt to the mentality of a jewish state . after a brief sojourn in france , where he was reunited with the rest of his family , the hilsenraths settled in the united states in the early 1950s , where edgar made a living as a waiter and night porter . another bittersweet satire , which draws on hilsenrath 's immigrant experience in new york , bears the provocative title , fuck america . honored in germany in a departure from works based on his life , his 1989 novel the story of the last thought , which hilsenrath considers to be his best work , deals with the extermination of the armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , for which he was awarded the alfred döblin prize for literature , which is sponsored by günter grass . the familiar themes - genocide and racial hatred , run through the novel . hilsenrath 's 80th birthday celebration will be held on april 9 at the city hall in berlin 's schöneberg district , where bernhard pfletschinger 's documentary film " night without morning " based on hilsenrath 's reminiscences of the wartime romanian ghetto , will premiere . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : celebrating germany 's " literary pope " when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .
