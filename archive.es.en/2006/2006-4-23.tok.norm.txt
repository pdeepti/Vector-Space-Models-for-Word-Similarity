they say it may have been a drunken brawl gone awry .

he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head , but a lack of broken ribs or upper body injuries implies he was not beaten once he lay on the ground , the paper said . according to the paper , the two suspects currently being held in karlsruhe on charges of robbery and attempted murder , vehemently deny the act .
they also deny being part of any radical right wing movement and they have no legal history of radicalism . brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm told bild am sonntag the investigation confirmed his notion that radicalsm was not the motive , saying , " the case must first be examined carefully , before making any judgments . … this is a trap a lot of people have fallen into .

" hubertus heil , general secretary of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded that an explanation from schäuble for his comments , and the vice president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , warned against playing down such acts of violence . heil told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that he found it " shocking that the interior minister negligently plays down such aggressive racism .
it is especially bad when someone is beaten nearly to death just because of the color of their skin . "
theirse told the paper that schäuble 's words were not helpful .
he pleaded for a swift investigation and said any racial motivations for the crime should not be swept under the carpet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party 's claudia roth earlier , green party head claudia roth , had called schäuble 's comments " unacceptable and " not worthy of an interior minister . "
she called on chancellor angela merkel to take up the cause of a fighting the extreme right , saying " we need a strong political signal . " in an interview with deutschlandradio culture program , schäuble had warned against jumping to conclusions , saying : " we do n't know the motive , we do n't know the criminals .
we need to be a little careful , " before making the controversial ethnicity comments . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market . " we want to set foot in at least two new markets , " lindemann said . soccer and sex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , viagra !
hello , aphrodisiac beer !
like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .
it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like . " it is expected that " 69 " will strike the right chord with testosterone-driven soccer fans this summer . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .

they say it may have been a drunken brawl gone awry .
nonetheless , there has been a loud outcry at comments made by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who played down the possibility of a racial motive in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , 37 year old ermyas m. in putting forth the possibility that he fight was more a drunken brawl than a race crime , the bild am sonntag newspaper noted that the victim , an engineer and a father of two who lives in the town of potsdam , had a high blood alcohol level -lrb- two tenths of a percent -rrb- at the time of the fight .
he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head , but a lack of broken ribs or upper body injuries implies he was not beaten once he lay on the ground , the paper said . according to the paper , the two suspects currently being held in karlsruhe on charges of robbery and attempted murder , vehemently deny the act .
they also deny being part of any radical right wing movement and they have no legal history of radicalism . brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm told bild am sonntag the investigation confirmed his notion that radicalsm was not the motive , saying , " the case must first be examined carefully , before making any judgments . … this is a trap a lot of people have fallen into .

in the immediate wake of the attacks , schäuble noted that " blond haired , blue-eyed people " were also victims of crimes , and " sometimes committed by people who are n't german citizens . " hubertus heil , general secretary of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded that an explanation from schäuble for his comments , and the vice president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , warned against playing down such acts of violence . heil told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that he found it " shocking that the interior minister negligently plays down such aggressive racism .
it is especially bad when someone is beaten nearly to death just because of the color of their skin . "
theirse told the paper that schäuble 's words were not helpful .
he pleaded for a swift investigation and said any racial motivations for the crime should not be swept under the carpet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party 's claudia roth earlier , green party head claudia roth , had called schäuble 's comments " unacceptable and " not worthy of an interior minister . "
she called on chancellor angela merkel to take up the cause of a fighting the extreme right , saying " we need a strong political signal . " in an interview with deutschlandradio culture program , schäuble had warned against jumping to conclusions , saying : " we do n't know the motive , we do n't know the criminals .
we need to be a little careful , " before making the controversial ethnicity comments . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

they say it may have been a drunken brawl gone awry .
nonetheless , there has been a loud outcry at comments made by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who played down the possibility of a racial motive in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , 37 year old ermyas m. in putting forth the possibility that he fight was more a drunken brawl than a race crime , the bild am sonntag newspaper noted that the victim , an engineer and a father of two who lives in the town of potsdam , had a high blood alcohol level -lrb- two tenths of a percent -rrb- at the time of the fight .
he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head , but a lack of broken ribs or upper body injuries implies he was not beaten once he lay on the ground , the paper said . according to the paper , the two suspects currently being held in karlsruhe on charges of robbery and attempted murder , vehemently deny the act .
they also deny being part of any radical right wing movement and they have no legal history of radicalism . brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm told bild am sonntag the investigation confirmed his notion that radicalsm was not the motive , saying , " the case must first be examined carefully , before making any judgments . … this is a trap a lot of people have fallen into .

" hubertus heil , general secretary of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded that an explanation from schäuble for his comments , and the vice president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , warned against playing down such acts of violence . heil told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that he found it " shocking that the interior minister negligently plays down such aggressive racism .
it is especially bad when someone is beaten nearly to death just because of the color of their skin . "
theirse told the paper that schäuble 's words were not helpful .
he pleaded for a swift investigation and said any racial motivations for the crime should not be swept under the carpet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party 's claudia roth earlier , green party head claudia roth , had called schäuble 's comments " unacceptable and " not worthy of an interior minister .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market .

like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .
it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like . " it is expected that " 69 " will strike the right chord with testosterone-driven soccer fans this summer . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market . " we want to set foot in at least two new markets , " lindemann said . soccer and sex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , viagra !
hello , aphrodisiac beer !
like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .
it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like . " it is expected that " 69 " will strike the right chord with testosterone-driven soccer fans this summer . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market . " we want to set foot in at least two new markets , " lindemann said . soccer and sex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , viagra !
hello , aphrodisiac beer !
like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .
it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like . " it is expected that " 69 " will strike the right chord with testosterone-driven soccer fans this summer . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .

they say it may have been a drunken brawl gone awry .
nonetheless , there has been a loud outcry at comments made by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who played down the possibility of a racial motive in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , 37 year old ermyas m. in putting forth the possibility that he fight was more a drunken brawl than a race crime , the bild am sonntag newspaper noted that the victim , an engineer and a father of two who lives in the town of potsdam , had a high blood alcohol level -lrb- two tenths of a percent -rrb- at the time of the fight .
he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head , but a lack of broken ribs or upper body injuries implies he was not beaten once he lay on the ground , the paper said . according to the paper , the two suspects currently being held in karlsruhe on charges of robbery and attempted murder , vehemently deny the act .
they also deny being part of any radical right wing movement and they have no legal history of radicalism . brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm told bild am sonntag the investigation confirmed his notion that radicalsm was not the motive , saying , " the case must first be examined carefully , before making any judgments . … this is a trap a lot of people have fallen into . " a week after the beating , the victim - who was in an artificial coma and is still in critical condition - has begun showing signs of improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in march , schäuble spoke at an international security conference meanwhile , opposition politicians continue to criticize statements by conservative interior minister schäuble .
in the immediate wake of the attacks , schäuble noted that " blond haired , blue-eyed people " were also victims of crimes , and " sometimes committed by people who are n't german citizens . " hubertus heil , general secretary of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded that an explanation from schäuble for his comments , and the vice president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , warned against playing down such acts of violence . heil told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that he found it " shocking that the interior minister negligently plays down such aggressive racism .
it is especially bad when someone is beaten nearly to death just because of the color of their skin . "
theirse told the paper that schäuble 's words were not helpful .
he pleaded for a swift investigation and said any racial motivations for the crime should not be swept under the carpet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party 's claudia roth earlier , green party head claudia roth , had called schäuble 's comments " unacceptable and " not worthy of an interior minister . "
she called on chancellor angela merkel to take up the cause of a fighting the extreme right , saying " we need a strong political signal . " in an interview with deutschlandradio culture program , schäuble had warned against jumping to conclusions , saying : " we do n't know the motive , we do n't know the criminals .

" it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .

instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .

the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .

they say it may have been a drunken brawl gone awry .
nonetheless , there has been a loud outcry at comments made by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who played down the possibility of a racial motive in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victim , 37 year old ermyas m. in putting forth the possibility that he fight was more a drunken brawl than a race crime , the bild am sonntag newspaper noted that the victim , an engineer and a father of two who lives in the town of potsdam , had a high blood alcohol level -lrb- two tenths of a percent -rrb- at the time of the fight .
he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head , but a lack of broken ribs or upper body injuries implies he was not beaten once he lay on the ground , the paper said . according to the paper , the two suspects currently being held in karlsruhe on charges of robbery and attempted murder , vehemently deny the act .
they also deny being part of any radical right wing movement and they have no legal history of radicalism . brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm told bild am sonntag the investigation confirmed his notion that radicalsm was not the motive , saying , " the case must first be examined carefully , before making any judgments . … this is a trap a lot of people have fallen into .

in the immediate wake of the attacks , schäuble noted that " blond haired , blue-eyed people " were also victims of crimes , and " sometimes committed by people who are n't german citizens . " hubertus heil , general secretary of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded that an explanation from schäuble for his comments , and the vice president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , warned against playing down such acts of violence . heil told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that he found it " shocking that the interior minister negligently plays down such aggressive racism .
it is especially bad when someone is beaten nearly to death just because of the color of their skin . "
theirse told the paper that schäuble 's words were not helpful .
he pleaded for a swift investigation and said any racial motivations for the crime should not be swept under the carpet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party 's claudia roth earlier , green party head claudia roth , had called schäuble 's comments " unacceptable and " not worthy of an interior minister . "
she called on chancellor angela merkel to take up the cause of a fighting the extreme right , saying " we need a strong political signal . " in an interview with deutschlandradio culture program , schäuble had warned against jumping to conclusions , saying : " we do n't know the motive , we do n't know the criminals .
we need to be a little careful , " before making the controversial ethnicity comments . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market .

it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like . " it is expected that " 69 " will strike the right chord with testosterone-driven soccer fans this summer . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .

" it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .

the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market .

it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like .

the summit , which is expected to address a wide range of integration policy issues including language competency , education and urban planning , should help the government develop a comprehensive policy for immigrants and their families . the announcement came as a response to the ongoing and increasingly heated debate on integration problems in the country .

she has been criticized - in sharp contrast to her social democrat predecessor marieluise beck - for not seeing herself as a true representative of germany 's immigrants and for not having enough contact with immigrant organizations .
böhmer stressed , however , that representatives of immigrant organizations will be invited to participate at the summit . uneasy debate finding a solution to integration problems may , indeed , prove to be difficult .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market .

it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market . " we want to set foot in at least two new markets , " lindemann said . soccer and sex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , viagra !
hello , aphrodisiac beer !
like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .
it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like . " it is expected that " 69 " will strike the right chord with testosterone-driven soccer fans this summer . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .

the summit , which is expected to address a wide range of integration policy issues including language competency , education and urban planning , should help the government develop a comprehensive policy for immigrants and their families . the announcement came as a response to the ongoing and increasingly heated debate on integration problems in the country .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market . " we want to set foot in at least two new markets , " lindemann said . soccer and sex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , viagra !
hello , aphrodisiac beer !
like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .
it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .
when the company announced its new product in the beginning of april , an enthusiastic german tabloid ran a story about " the first beer that even women will like . " it is expected that " 69 " will strike the right chord with testosterone-driven soccer fans this summer . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .

" it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .

this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .

the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .

the summit , which is expected to address a wide range of integration policy issues including language competency , education and urban planning , should help the government develop a comprehensive policy for immigrants and their families . the announcement came as a response to the ongoing and increasingly heated debate on integration problems in the country .
earlier this month , a berlin court convicted a 19-year-old man from a turkish immigrant family for gunning down his sister on a berlin street last year in a much publicized case of ' honor killing , ' which had stunned and enraged the german public . avoiding ghettoization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lack of language proficiency is often an obstacle to integration the german public also responded with great concern to the news that police checks had to be introduced at an unruly school in berlin 's ethnically diverse suburb of neuköln , attended mostly by children from immigrant families . speaking about the tensions at the rütli school in berlin-neuköln , school principal petra eggebrecht put the problem of school violence into a broader perspective . " we have 83 percent children from immigrant families , " eggebrecht said .

" in berlin-neukölln , it 's one in three .
and 40 percent of young people with immigrant background have no professional qualifications . " the preparation of the integration summit is an important test for böhmer .
she has been criticized - in sharp contrast to her social democrat predecessor marieluise beck - for not seeing herself as a true representative of germany 's immigrants and for not having enough contact with immigrant organizations .
böhmer stressed , however , that representatives of immigrant organizations will be invited to participate at the summit . uneasy debate finding a solution to integration problems may , indeed , prove to be difficult .
there is currently no consensus in the country regarding immigration tests or the degree to which forced marriages should be sanctioned . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - cdu 's sister party in bavaria - raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested residence permits should be revoked from the immigrants who refused to integrate .
social democrats , the green party and the left party rejected such an approach .

the event is seen as a brand-building exercise for the more than 300 indian companies showcasing expertise in automotive , energy , engineering services and research development . singh noted in the handelsblatt interview that the indian economy had grown an average of six percent per year since 1991 , and picked up the pace recently to between 7.5 and eight percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.04.2006 german government planning integration summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is urgently looking for a new integration concept in an attempt to develop a new integration concept , the german government will organize a summit to address a wide range of issues surrounding immigrants and their families . the german government announced it was planning an integration summit to take place in berlin by the beginning of july , at the latest .
the summit , which is expected to address a wide range of integration policy issues including language competency , education and urban planning , should help the government develop a comprehensive policy for immigrants and their families . the announcement came as a response to the ongoing and increasingly heated debate on integration problems in the country .
earlier this month , a berlin court convicted a 19-year-old man from a turkish immigrant family for gunning down his sister on a berlin street last year in a much publicized case of ' honor killing , ' which had stunned and enraged the german public . avoiding ghettoization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lack of language proficiency is often an obstacle to integration the german public also responded with great concern to the news that police checks had to be introduced at an unruly school in berlin 's ethnically diverse suburb of neuköln , attended mostly by children from immigrant families . speaking about the tensions at the rütli school in berlin-neuköln , school principal petra eggebrecht put the problem of school violence into a broader perspective . " we have 83 percent children from immigrant families , " eggebrecht said .
" the failed integration policies have lead to ghettoization in our schools .
the students no longer have any perspective in life , the parents are unemployed .
all these problems clash together in a school , and teachers are supposed to find a solution .
there is no solution . " no more indifference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner for integration maria böhmer germany 's commissioner for integration maria böhmer and member of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said in a recent parliamentary debate that the time of indifference regarding immigration problems was over . " one in five students who come from an immigrant family does not get a high school diploma , " böhmer said .
" in berlin-neukölln , it 's one in three .
and 40 percent of young people with immigrant background have no professional qualifications . " the preparation of the integration summit is an important test for böhmer .
she has been criticized - in sharp contrast to her social democrat predecessor marieluise beck - for not seeing herself as a true representative of germany 's immigrants and for not having enough contact with immigrant organizations .
böhmer stressed , however , that representatives of immigrant organizations will be invited to participate at the summit . uneasy debate finding a solution to integration problems may , indeed , prove to be difficult .
there is currently no consensus in the country regarding immigration tests or the degree to which forced marriages should be sanctioned . edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - cdu 's sister party in bavaria - raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested residence permits should be revoked from the immigrants who refused to integrate .
social democrats , the green party and the left party rejected such an approach .
german minister of justice and spd member brigitte zypries said it would be difficult to define " refusal to integrate " in legal terms . around 14 million people living in germany have an immigration background . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration debate rages in wake of honor killing conviction the so-called honor killing of 23-year-old hatan sürücü by her brother ayhan and his subsequent trial and conviction have plunged germany further into a volatile debate regarding the integration of muslim immigrants .

" it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .

instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market .

it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life . " if we become world champions , things will really get going , " lindemann said . according to lindemann , big sport events are often connected with the consumption of erotica .
the beate uhse erotic cable channel , for instance , is known for getting higher viewer ratings on sunday evenings , in the time slot immediately following a popular sport news show on one of germany 's two public broadcasters . beate uhse has recently struck a deal with a german beer maker to produce a special brand of beer called " 69 , " which - in addition to offering the usual joys of intoxication - is also aimed at increasing male potency .
the beer contains an extract of muira puama , an aphrodisiac plant from the amazon region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.04.2006 erotica empire beate uhse 's trick : turning pleasure to profit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate uhse sex shops have become a recognizable fixture in german cityscapes the earnings of german erotica firm beate uhse are up .
but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market . " we want to set foot in at least two new markets , " lindemann said . soccer and sex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , viagra !
hello , aphrodisiac beer !
like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .

but the company is hoping to do even better thanks to the mysterious connection between soccer and sex . turnover at beate uhse group , germany 's - and europe 's - largest erotica company , rose 4 percent last year despite the overall sluggishness of the european retail market . for 2005 , the company 's sales increased 284.4 million euros -lrb- $ 347.7 million -rrb- , while pre-tax profits were up 31 percent to 20.4 million euros . " it 's a great result , " said ceo otto christian lindemann .
" the company is on the right track . " beate uhse , which is a major brand and a name with 98 percent household recognition in germany , is expecting 5 percent growth this year , with sales currently projected to reach 300 million euros . expanding eastward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clothes do n't necessarily make the man , but can certainly be used to seduce one beate uhse is also the name of the company founder , a german birth-control pioneer who single-handedly ran the business for half a century until her death in 2001 , two years after the company went public .
the beate uhse group owns movie theaters , a mail-order business and some 300 stores in eleven countries that sell everything from toys and videos to lingerie and condoms . with the company 's net earnings increasing a staggering 65 percent in 2005 to 14.4 million euros , beate uhse shareholders have a good reason to celebrate .
instead of the projected 10 percent per share dividend for 2005 , the company announced shareholders should now be looking forward to 14 percent instead .
this will be in sharp contrast with the disappointing results of 2004 , which left shareholders empty-handed . the company intends to focus on online sales , which alone grew by 125 million euros in 2005 .
the internet , with its built-in anonymity and purchase-from-home convenience , has become a major factor in the sales of erotica . with the prospect of continued growth in 2006 , beate uhse is also hoping to expand further on the eastern european market . " we want to set foot in at least two new markets , " lindemann said . soccer and sex bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , viagra !
hello , aphrodisiac beer !
like many busnisses in germany , beate uhse is eager to profit from the fifa world cup , which will be taking place in germany between june 9 and july 9 .
it is difficult to predict the exact effect the soccer championship will have on the company , but beate uhse officials hare hoping a german victory in the finals would not only stir up athletic passions in the country , but also inspire a general lust for life .

the summit , which is expected to address a wide range of integration policy issues including language competency , education and urban planning , should help the government develop a comprehensive policy for immigrants and their families . the announcement came as a response to the ongoing and increasingly heated debate on integration problems in the country .

with nepal 's seven-party political alliance soundly rejecting king gyanendra 's offer that they name a new prime minister , the stage is set for a showdown .
the opposition says the king 's offer does not address their central concerns , and opposition leaders have pledged to continue the protests , now entering a third week .
many believe the opposition can not embrace a king who has become so unpopular with the nepalese public .
and although the seven party alliance has been taking the lead , the protests have clearly assumed a life of their own .
on saturday , for the first time since the protests began , protesters were able to break through police cordons and come to within a few kilometres of the royal palace .
this is now very much a people 's protest .
and the overwhelming sentiment is that any decision on the role of the monarchy in nepal now has to be left to the people , and not to king gyanendra .
we no longer want to remain a monarchy - the king must abdicate ravi thapa , protester king gyanendra 's speech on friday inviting the opposition to name a new prime minister was a significant climb-down from his recently stated positions .
in earlier reactions to the protests , he played down the dissent as being confined to a few .
he also suggested it was being stoked by maoist insurgents , who have waged a decade-long insurgency to overthrow the monarchy .
now he says he is prepared to hand over power to the politicians from whom he seized direct control in february 2005 .
divide and rule ?
but reactions from the parties have been negative .
many of them believe the speech is merely a tactic by the king to continue to retain his position .
others say he simply has not gone far enough .
" the king has not addressed the central issue which is that he restore the parliament that he suspended last year , " a former foreign minister , chakra prasad bastola , told the bbc .
the king has consistently maintained that he will call fresh elections by next year .
but the political parties want elections to a constituent assembly that has the power to change the constitution - a move the palace has resisted all along .
some observers believe that the speech is a clever move by the king to shift attention from himself to the political parties .
the question is , how will people on the streets react ?
the parties are a divisive lot and have in the past often been embroiled in a bitter struggle .
up until now , they have been united in their opposition to the king .
but many say they would have found it difficult to name a prime minister acceptable to all seven in the opposition alliance .
" if the seven party alliance is unable to utilise the opportunity they have been given , then it gives him an opportunity to once again exercise his powers , perhaps even use military force to quell the street protests , " says analyst umanga pandey .
the onus is , however , also on the nepal 's public , especially the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets of the capital in the recent days .
many of them say that the king 's concessions are too little , too late .
" this is not what we came out on the streets for , " said one protester , ravi thapa .
" we want power to be handed over to us .
we no longer want to remain a monarchy - the king must abdicate . "
rhoderick chalmers of the international crisis group says much depends on how the protesters react in the coming days and also how the security forces deal with the situation .
" the question is , will the people on the streets continue or will they be satisfied with what they have achieved ? " he told the bbc .
" and will the security forces act with restraint ? "
nepal is the world 's only hindu kingdom and king gyanendra represents a line of monarchs that has ruled over it almost continuously since 1768 .
but with growing support for a republic the question is , can he do enough to save his monarchy ?

with nepal 's seven-party political alliance soundly rejecting king gyanendra 's offer that they name a new prime minister , the stage is set for a showdown .
the opposition says the king 's offer does not address their central concerns , and opposition leaders have pledged to continue the protests , now entering a third week .
many believe the opposition can not embrace a king who has become so unpopular with the nepalese public .
and although the seven party alliance has been taking the lead , the protests have clearly assumed a life of their own .
on saturday , for the first time since the protests began , protesters were able to break through police cordons and come to within a few kilometres of the royal palace .
this is now very much a people 's protest .
and the overwhelming sentiment is that any decision on the role of the monarchy in nepal now has to be left to the people , and not to king gyanendra .
we no longer want to remain a monarchy - the king must abdicate ravi thapa , protester king gyanendra 's speech on friday inviting the opposition to name a new prime minister was a significant climb-down from his recently stated positions .
in earlier reactions to the protests , he played down the dissent as being confined to a few .
he also suggested it was being stoked by maoist insurgents , who have waged a decade-long insurgency to overthrow the monarchy .
now he says he is prepared to hand over power to the politicians from whom he seized direct control in february 2005 .
divide and rule ?
but reactions from the parties have been negative .
many of them believe the speech is merely a tactic by the king to continue to retain his position .
others say he simply has not gone far enough .
" the king has not addressed the central issue which is that he restore the parliament that he suspended last year , " a former foreign minister , chakra prasad bastola , told the bbc .
the king has consistently maintained that he will call fresh elections by next year .
but the political parties want elections to a constituent assembly that has the power to change the constitution - a move the palace has resisted all along .
some observers believe that the speech is a clever move by the king to shift attention from himself to the political parties .
the question is , how will people on the streets react ?
the parties are a divisive lot and have in the past often been embroiled in a bitter struggle .
up until now , they have been united in their opposition to the king .
but many say they would have found it difficult to name a prime minister acceptable to all seven in the opposition alliance .
" if the seven party alliance is unable to utilise the opportunity they have been given , then it gives him an opportunity to once again exercise his powers , perhaps even use military force to quell the street protests , " says analyst umanga pandey .
the onus is , however , also on the nepal 's public , especially the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets of the capital in the recent days .
many of them say that the king 's concessions are too little , too late .
" this is not what we came out on the streets for , " said one protester , ravi thapa .
" we want power to be handed over to us .
we no longer want to remain a monarchy - the king must abdicate . "
rhoderick chalmers of the international crisis group says much depends on how the protesters react in the coming days and also how the security forces deal with the situation .
" the question is , will the people on the streets continue or will they be satisfied with what they have achieved ? " he told the bbc .
" and will the security forces act with restraint ? "
nepal is the world 's only hindu kingdom and king gyanendra represents a line of monarchs that has ruled over it almost continuously since 1768 .
but with growing support for a republic the question is , can he do enough to save his monarchy ?

the club 's sophia gardens ground will need to be redeveloped if test cricket is to to be played in the city in 2009 .
one campaigner neil mcevoy claimed there has been no full environmental impact assessement of the club 's plans .
cardiff council has pledged support for the club , insisting it has three years to get all issues resolved .
glamorgan beat other major english counties to host australia in the summer of 2009 , although the game is dependent on securing the redevelopment of sophia gardens .
the planned redevelopment would treble the 5,500 capacity of the ground , which stands in city park land .
cardiff council is due to decide on the plans on 10 may .

neil mcevoy , a former councillor and spokesman for the save our parklands campaign , said : " the ashes are very welcome in cardiff but this development is in the wrong place .
" i would say sophia gardens is probably the worst place in the city to develop such a huge stadium .
within cardiff there are brown field sites which we could develop .
they 've not been looked at .
' public transport ' " i would like somebody to explain to me why , in the rush to develop , there has been no full environmental impact assessment .

there may well be traffic issues ... but we 've got to make sure the traffic and highways people plan those out russell goodway , cardiff chamber of commerce mr mcevoy said the environmental studies conducted so far paid only " lip service " to likely impact of the scheme .
he added : " i think people are horrified that there is no provision for any improvement in public transport . "
russell goodway , chief executive of cardiff 's chamber of commerce , said bringing international cricket to the city would add to its reputation as a place to visit , boosting the hospitality and tourism sector on which 15,000 jobs depended .
he said many of the concerns raised about the development sounded similiar to the objections once heard about the millennium stadium which he said had threatened " grave consequences that never transpired " .
he said : " there may well be traffic issues relating to this development but we 've got to make sure the traffic and highways people plan those out , those problems have to be planned out and it 's possible to do it . "

the club 's sophia gardens ground will need to be redeveloped if test cricket is to to be played in the city in 2009 .
one campaigner neil mcevoy claimed there has been no full environmental impact assessement of the club 's plans .
cardiff council has pledged support for the club , insisting it has three years to get all issues resolved .
glamorgan beat other major english counties to host australia in the summer of 2009 , although the game is dependent on securing the redevelopment of sophia gardens .
the planned redevelopment would treble the 5,500 capacity of the ground , which stands in city park land .
cardiff council is due to decide on the plans on 10 may . "
i would say sophia gardens is probably the worst place in the city to develop such a huge stadium " neil mcevoy , save our parklands objectors claim the scheme would adversely affect the listed parkland setting .
neil mcevoy , a former councillor and spokesman for the save our parklands campaign , said : " the ashes are very welcome in cardiff but this development is in the wrong place .
" i would say sophia gardens is probably the worst place in the city to develop such a huge stadium .
within cardiff there are brown field sites which we could develop .
they 've not been looked at .
' public transport ' " i would like somebody to explain to me why , in the rush to develop , there has been no full environmental impact assessment .
it 's quite shocking . "
" there may well be traffic issues ... but we 've got to make sure the traffic and highways people plan those out " russell goodway , cardiff chamber of commerce mr mcevoy said the environmental studies conducted so far paid only " lip service " to likely impact of the scheme .
he added : " i think people are horrified that there is no provision for any improvement in public transport . "
russell goodway , chief executive of cardiff 's chamber of commerce , said bringing international cricket to the city would add to its reputation as a place to visit , boosting the hospitality and tourism sector on which 15,000 jobs depended .
he said many of the concerns raised about the development sounded similiar to the objections once heard about the millennium stadium which he said had threatened " grave consequences that never transpired " .
he said : " there may well be traffic issues relating to this development but we 've got to make sure the traffic and highways people plan those out , those problems have to be planned out and it 's possible to do it . "
after thursday 's announcement of the ashes fixture , elgan morgan , council executive member for environment and transport insisted that the planning committee would make its decision " on planning rules and regulations as it always does " .
he added : " it will have to stick by the law otherwise it will be open to challenge . "
campaigners , who held a meeting on saturday , hold a further meeting at pontcanna scout hall , fields park road , pontcanna , at 1900 bst on sunday .

professor rod morgan , chairman of the youth justice board , believes it could lead to some youths being " demonised " .
he told the independent on sunday that alternatives to court action are better for some bad behaviour incidents .
young person 's charity the ymca said some youths are being punished for what used to be called " high jinks " .
professor morgan called for a radical rethink into how unruly teenagers are dealt with and said there are " adverse consequences to fixing the mark of cain to a child 's forehead " .
he blamed " misplaced hysteria over teenage crime " and warned that the issuing of asbos and taking young people through the court system could lead to labelling children , who then live up to their name .
however , his comments come as prime minister tony blair told the observer that he wanted to " harry , hassle and hound " criminals into giving up or leaving britain .
' labelling effect ' children were being sent to court for trivial offences such as swearing in the playground or breaking windows , mr morgan told the paper .
instead , teachers and parents should be reprimanding them , and more use should be made of early prevention schemes such as dedicated police officers in schools .
" there are adverse consequences of fixing a mark of cain to a child 's forehead .
we should not forget the lessons of the 1960s and 70s of the labelling effect .
the argument is that if you give a dog a bad name then the dog may live up to the name , " he told the paper . "
there are a growing number of instances where incidents which used to be regarded as high-jinks or normal adolescent behaviour 15-20 years ago are being seen as criminal activity now " ceri davies , ymca mps out of touch on crime - blair professor morgan , who has been in post for two years , said there was also a danger that serious offenders who did need targeting would slip through the net .
last month the home office revealed it had issued 7,356 anti-social behaviour orders in england and wales since the scheme was introduced in 1999 , the home office says .

the year-long complete works festival , which begins on the anniversary of the bard 's death , will stage his sonnets , poems and all 37 shakespeare plays .
dame judi dench and sir ian mckellen are among the performers taking part .
rsc artistic director michael boyd told the bbc that the event would be a " national knees-up " .
" our ambition is to stage one of the most significant cultural festivals of the year in stratford-upon-avon , " said mr boyd .
shakespeare is traditionally said to have been born on 23 april 1564 , and to have died on the same day 52 years later , in 1616 .
hailed as the biggest theatrical celebration in the company 's history , the rsc claims the festival marks the first time all the plays have been staged in one continuous season .
overseas productions titus andronicus - japan richard iii - kuwait richard ii - germany two gentlemen of verona - brazil macbeth- - poland midsummer night 's dream - india hamlet - south africa seventeen overseas theatre companies and 14 uk theatre companies will perform at the festival , as well as the 23 productions being staged by the rsc .
ten of the productions will be in languages other than english , at least in part .
" it shows how fantastically universal the plays are , and seeing people 's different approach , " said dame judi , who will play mistress quickly in the merry wives of windsor .
outdoor theatre bbc arts correspondent rebecca jones called the project " a gamble " , but said ticket sales were already up by a 25 per cent on the equivalent period last year .
" if the festival is a success it could help revitalise a company which has been criticised by some for losing its way , " said jones .
a new outdoor theatre - the dell - will be built in the riverside gardens beside the royal shakespeare theatre , and a temporary 100-seat studio will be erected inside the auditorium for a month .
actors will also perform in the 1,000-seat courtyard theatre , which is scheduled to open in july 2006 , and holy trinity church , the burial place of shakespeare .

the fishermen at ports like boston in lincolnshire say the average eider duck can pack away about 2kg of mussels every day .
that is about four large supermarket packs each .
and now a burgeoning population of mussel loving ducks is placing an entire industry under threat .
april marks the end of the year 's mussel harvest on the vast waters of the wash estuary .
it has been a dreadful season and there are many who fear it is the last one they will work .
in a classic conflict between the environment and industry , fishermen in the ports around the wash say they can only watch as thousands of eider duck gobble up one of the mainstays of the local economy .
the duck is allowed to feed unchallenged because of the protected status of the wash - it is a site of special scientific interest run by the government agency english nature .
eider ducks dive in the shallow waters and gobble up the mussels it is only in recent years that the mussel beds have caught the eye of the eider .
that is because fishermen have improved catches by buying in mussel larvae and " planting " them in sites on the shallow sea bed known as " lays " .
" the mussel fishermen are now growing perfect mussels for eider " , richard leaf of english nature tells the politics show for yorkshire and lincolnshire .
" they are increasingly concentrating in numbers and feeding on this wonderful food source which is a very juicy meaty mussel with a very thin shell perfect for eider just underneath the water in the way they like to dive down " henry bellingham says fishermen just want to protect their crop english nature is trialling the effectiveness of floating eider duck scarers .
it has placed three of them over the muscle beds .
the shell fishermen want many more of them but english nature says they are too disruptive to the bird population .
" what the fishermen want is a licence to cull a few of them and to scare them away " , says local mp henry bellingham .
" just as any farmer would ask for permission to protect his crops , it 's as simple as that .

the fishermen at ports like boston in lincolnshire say the average eider duck can pack away about 2kg of mussels every day .
that is about four large supermarket packs each .
and now a burgeoning population of mussel loving ducks is placing an entire industry under threat .
april marks the end of the year 's mussel harvest on the vast waters of the wash estuary .
it has been a dreadful season and there are many who fear it is the last one they will work .
in a classic conflict between the environment and industry , fishermen in the ports around the wash say they can only watch as thousands of eider duck gobble up one of the mainstays of the local economy .
the duck is allowed to feed unchallenged because of the protected status of the wash - it is a site of special scientific interest run by the government agency english nature .
eider ducks dive in the shallow waters and gobble up the mussels it is only in recent years that the mussel beds have caught the eye of the eider .
that is because fishermen have improved catches by buying in mussel larvae and " planting " them in sites on the shallow sea bed known as " lays " .
" the mussel fishermen are now growing perfect mussels for eider " , richard leaf of english nature tells the politics show for yorkshire and lincolnshire .
" they are increasingly concentrating in numbers and feeding on this wonderful food source which is a very juicy meaty mussel with a very thin shell perfect for eider just underneath the water in the way they like to dive down " henry bellingham says fishermen just want to protect their crop english nature is trialling the effectiveness of floating eider duck scarers .
it has placed three of them over the muscle beds .
the shell fishermen want many more of them but english nature says they are too disruptive to the bird population .
" what the fishermen want is a licence to cull a few of them and to scare them away " , says local mp henry bellingham .
" just as any farmer would ask for permission to protect his crops , it 's as simple as that .
