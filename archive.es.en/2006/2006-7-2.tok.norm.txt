not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .
besides , i thought kalle rummenigge was really great .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .

he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .

he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .
besides , i thought kalle rummenigge was really great .
and since then the enthusiasm has n't left me . christine harjes interviewed nicole selmer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .
now though , ever more women are making their way to the stadiums .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?
no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 24 , 2006 -rrb- cashing in on the lucrative " soccer widows " market while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape .

i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .
but there is responsibility .
germany must become the leading country in the fight against anti-semitism .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .
besides , i thought kalle rummenigge was really great .
and since then the enthusiasm has n't left me . christine harjes interviewed nicole selmer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .
now though , ever more women are making their way to the stadiums .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?
no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 24 , 2006 -rrb- cashing in on the lucrative " soccer widows " market while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .

he said he hoped to continue as a player for england , but not as captain . " on november 15 , 2000 peter taylor gave me the greatest honor of my career in making me the captain of england , fulfilling me childhood dream , " said the real madrid star .
" now , almost six years later , after being captain for 58 of my 95 caps , i feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter in a new era under steve mcclaren . " " it has been an honor and a privilege to have captained our country and i want to stress that i wish to continue to play for england and look forward to helping both the new captain and steve mcclaren in any way i can . " " i came to this decision some time ago some time ago but i had hoped to announce it on the back of a successful world cup .
sadly that was n't to be , " added beckham . " this decision has been the most difficult of my career to date .
but after discussing it with my family and those closest to me i feel the time is right . " " i wish to thank all the players for their support during my time as captian , as well as peter taylor , sven and all the coaches .
i would also like to thank the press and of course all the england supporters who have both been great to me and my teammates .
i want them to know for me it has been an absolute honor .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .
but there is responsibility .

pope benedict has decided to open all vatican archives from 1922-1939 .
the secret archives should offer new insight into the catholic church 's actions in europe during the rise of nazism . the vatican said on friday that it will open its central files , known as the secret archives , as well as files of its secretariat of state for the 17-year papacy of pius xi , who died in 1939 .
in a short announcement , it said the opening would " make available for historical research … all documentary sources until february 1939 that are stored in different series of the archives of the holy see . " parts of the archives can already be consulted by researchers but the documents to be made available from september are expected to shed new light on the vatican 's diplomatic activities in the run-up to world war ii . wartime archives off-limits historians have long pushed the vatican to open its wartime archives to answer questions about what the catholic church knew about the nazi persecution of europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pius xii 's wartime papacy has been attacked by critics however the archives of the pontificate of pius xi 's successor , pius xii , whom critics accuse of failing to help the jews , will remain closed for the time being . " i welcome the decision to release the documents , but urge the vatican to do more , " rabbi marvien hier , dean of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , told reuters . heir said that while the new documents would shed light on the church 's activities leading up to the war , it was pius xii 's actions during the war that were of crucial importance .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .
but there is responsibility .
germany must become the leading country in the fight against anti-semitism .

at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .

at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .

what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .

but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .

at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .

and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .
but there is responsibility .
germany must become the leading country in the fight against anti-semitism .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .
besides , i thought kalle rummenigge was really great .
and since then the enthusiasm has n't left me . christine harjes interviewed nicole selmer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .

actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .
besides , i thought kalle rummenigge was really great .
and since then the enthusiasm has n't left me . christine harjes interviewed nicole selmer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .
now though , ever more women are making their way to the stadiums .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?
no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 24 , 2006 -rrb- cashing in on the lucrative " soccer widows " market while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape .

the italians hope to improve on that unimpressive series against germany on tuesday . speaking of series , germany ended one of their darkest by beating argentina on penalties to go through to the semifinals .
that victory put a stop to a winless series against the so-called " big " soccer nations that extended back six years . jürgen klinsmann 's squad has been a freight train gaining speed at this world cup .
the next match against italy will give the germans the opportunity to defeat another " big " soccer country - and atone for an embarrassing 4-1 defeat dealt to them by italy in march . " the humiliation of that defeat is still painful , " said midfielder torsten frings .

now we 'll try to win a place in the final .
we do n't want to stop now .
this is so beautiful , we want to carry it on , " he said after the win over brazil . zidane and les bleus will have to defeat surprise team portugal to carry on .
no small task considering that their coach is luiz felipe scolari , the man who led brazil to their 2002 world cup title .
scolari has instilled what he has called a " warrior spirit " in the portugal squad that is trying to better their best world cup performance , a third-place finish , 40 years ago . " we have a good team and can go even further as we advance , " the man known as " big phil " said after the penalty shootout win over england . that 's more than can be said for pre-tournament south american picks brazil and argentina .

humbert is to be replaced by christian streiff , a former top executive for the french glass manufacturer saint gobain . tough-minded businessman forgeard , 59 , had a reputation as a tough-minded businessman whose personal fortunes were closely tied to the european aerospace group . a former advisor to president jacques chirac , forgeard had relied partly on the french leader 's backing to wage - and win - a fierce leadership struggle at eads that saw him named co-chief executive in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deliveries of the airbus 380 are behind , but so far , no clients have cancelled their orders before joining eads , forgeard spent seven years at the helm of the aircraft maker airbus , where he was credited with regaining market leadership from the us manufacturer boeing . described as charismatic and strong-willed , forgeard 's professional assurance and forceful managerial style has also led to charges of arrogance . " he is not somebody who gives up easily .
he 's extremely pugnacious , like a bulldog who wo n't let go , " a former colleague said . " when forgeard was at airbus , his plan was simple - to be the world 's number one - and he succeeded . " tensions with german partners his nomination at the head of eads sparked tensions with the german partners in the company , with daimlerchrysler suspecting him of seeking to undermine the group 's joint french-german management structure . the germans accused him of trying to mount a coup when he questioned the two-headed leadership of the group and of trying , without success , to arrange a merger with thales . but the delays to the a380 , the problems with the a350 which is having to be radically reviewed , and the timing of the sale of the stock options cast a long shadow over his performance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de franco-german economic marriage hits a rough patch the franco-german aerospace giant eads has hit a patch of turbulence .

i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .

are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .

maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .

pope benedict has decided to open all vatican archives from 1922-1939 .
the secret archives should offer new insight into the catholic church 's actions in europe during the rise of nazism . the vatican said on friday that it will open its central files , known as the secret archives , as well as files of its secretariat of state for the 17-year papacy of pius xi , who died in 1939 .
in a short announcement , it said the opening would " make available for historical research … all documentary sources until february 1939 that are stored in different series of the archives of the holy see . " parts of the archives can already be consulted by researchers but the documents to be made available from september are expected to shed new light on the vatican 's diplomatic activities in the run-up to world war ii . wartime archives off-limits historians have long pushed the vatican to open its wartime archives to answer questions about what the catholic church knew about the nazi persecution of europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pius xii 's wartime papacy has been attacked by critics however the archives of the pontificate of pius xi 's successor , pius xii , whom critics accuse of failing to help the jews , will remain closed for the time being . " i welcome the decision to release the documents , but urge the vatican to do more , " rabbi marvien hier , dean of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , told reuters . heir said that while the new documents would shed light on the church 's activities leading up to the war , it was pius xii 's actions during the war that were of crucial importance .

not any more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female soccer fans are a conspicuous minority soccer fever in germany is not subject to gender limitations .
at the stadium , at public viewings or at home , ladies are tuning in to the world cup just as much as the guys .
but it 's not a new phenomenon , says one expert . nicole selmer is author of the book " watching the boys play - women as soccer fans " -lrb- agon-sportverlag , 2004 -rrb- .
when not following the world cup , she faithfully roots for borussia dortmund - through thick and thin . dw-world.de : it 's predominantly men who attend soccer games during the regular season , but now we 're suddenly seeing tons of women in the stands .
what 's different ? nicole selmer : unfortunately i have to contradict that statement .
i 've been in the world cup stadiums and i have to say that there are fewer women there than during the regular bundesliga season .
i would say that women make up about a quarter of the spectators at bundesliga games , but less than that now during the world cup . there are a whole lot of women at the fan fests , public viewings , in the pubs and definitely in front of the tv at home . a good half of the viewers there are women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole selmer found an interest in soccer during the 1982 world cup why are women suddenly so interested in soccer ? it 's not the case that women are interested in soccer now all of a sudden .
the discovery that women sit in front of the tv and watch soccer games has been made during every world cup for the past 16 years .
that was the case in italy in 1990 as well .
half of the people watching the semi-final germany-england game were women .
that was true in ' 94 in the us and in ' 98 in france .
in south korea the crowd was totally female - you could even hear it in the fans ' high-pitched screeching - and the same thing is being discovered again in germany right now .
actually , it 's really not a new phenomenon .
certainly , a lot more women are interested in national games than in the bundesliga , but that 's true about the men , too . the cliche goes that women want to check out the players ' well-toned legs and backsides and hope to catch a glimpse of naked torsos when they trade jerseys at the end of the game .
is there truth to the stereotype ? it really is a stereotype .
but it 's true that women can talk about other things at a soccer game than men . when the men get up and go to the concession stand for a beer - then maybe the women will talk about how the players look or who they like .
those are probably things the men do n't talk about , because it does n't fit with the classic cliche of how a fan is supposed to act . do men and women watch soccer in the same way ? i know from my interviews with female fans that there are quite a lot of similarities , which tend to outweigh the differences .
but the major difference is that going to a stadium does n't have the same meaning for men and women .
when men go alone , they do n't get stared at and they do n't have to explain the offsides rule when they become chancellor .
-lsb- german chancellor angela merkel was asked by journalists to explain the offsides rule . -rsb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the women just there to check out the players ' fine-tuned bodies - like michael ballack 's ? men always like to pretend that they are real soccer experts and would have led their team to victory a long time ago had someone given them the chance .
are women like that , too ? yes , sometimes .
i think for women there is a wide spectrum of behavioral styles as far as soccer is concerned .
take the classic situation of a large group of people sitting in front of the television .
there are women who make an extra effort to say things like , " oh , that 's so cute ! "
maybe just to bother their husbands a little bit .
and then there are other women who try to make a lot of clever statements and enjoy the attention they get . women often have to put up with the accusation that they do n't even know what an offsides trap is .
is that different now during the world cup , where women are attending public viewings with big screens and following the games on their tv at home ? i do n't think so .
the fan fests and public viewings are n't really about soccer .
no one talks about offsides or tactics there .
it 's just about having fun - it 's not even only about winning .
you can see that in the fans of the teams that have lost .
they 're not as sad as the fans in the bundesliga .
it 's a bit less existential , i think . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's soccer has been booming since these german ladies won the world cup in 2003 , said selmer since the world cup started , you can see people kicking soccer balls around at all the parks .
with this general increase in soccer enthusiasm , do you think that more women will also begin playing ? i definitely think so .
but i also think that has to do with the women 's soccer boom that 's been going on since the german team won the world cup title in 2003 .
that has certainly had an influence as well .
more and more girls are playing soccer as children , so it 's something they start to see as normal , something they know about . how did you first become interested in soccer ? i became interested in soccer by watching the 1982 world cup when i was 12 .
actually , it was n't a particularly good world cup and the german games were especially unimpressive , but that made the excitement get to me all the more .
besides , i thought kalle rummenigge was really great .
and since then the enthusiasm has n't left me . christine harjes interviewed nicole selmer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .
now though , ever more women are making their way to the stadiums .

france knocked out the favorites to make it an all-european semifinals brazil and argentina are packing their bags for home , leaving the 2006 world cup to be battled for amongst four european teams .
with the exception of italy , few people had the europeans on their list of favorites . the favorites entering the world cup 2006 - five-time winner and defending champ brazil and high-flying two-time champs argentina - have been knocked off their thrones .
coming to germany with the hope of keeping the title on their home continent , the selecao and the argentineans must watch how europe will reclaim the trophy that has been bouncing back and forth between the continents of south america and europe since brazil 's victory in chile in 1962 . four european countries , hosts germany , three-time victors italy , 1998 winners france , and surprising portugal , have gained the right to fight for soccer 's most prestigious prize , an improbable possibility just over three weeks ago before the cup 's opening match between germany and costa rica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only pure dejection could describe germany after a 4-1 loss in florence it will be the first time since 1982 that four european teams stand alone in the semifinals of the world cup .
then in spain , italy defeated germany 3-1 in the final .
to get there , the two teams beat poland and france respectively . a chance for retribution the 1982 champs , italy , are the only team that people had on their lists of favorites entering the tournament .
marcello lippi 's azzurri also were the only side to breeze through to the final four with their 3-0 victory against ukraine .
yet , the italians have had little luck against host countries at the world cup .
of the seven matches the squadra azzurra have been forced to face the hosts , they have won just once , a 1-0 win against argentina in the group phase in 1978 .
the italians hope to improve on that unimpressive series against germany on tuesday . speaking of series , germany ended one of their darkest by beating argentina on penalties to go through to the semifinals .
that victory put a stop to a winless series against the so-called " big " soccer nations that extended back six years . jürgen klinsmann 's squad has been a freight train gaining speed at this world cup .
the next match against italy will give the germans the opportunity to defeat another " big " soccer country - and atone for an embarrassing 4-1 defeat dealt to them by italy in march . " the humiliation of that defeat is still painful , " said midfielder torsten frings .
" but we 're so fit now , so well prepared , that we know it is not going to happen again . " the surprises keep coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old boys barthez and zidane have carried france to the semis what many people thought would never happen again was seeing france 's zinedine zidane just one game away from another world cup final .
yet , " zizou " , who will be retiring after this tournament , has risen to the occasion , proving to be the key player in their two knockout stage victories over spain and brazil . " we fought closely together for a well-deserved victory .
now we 'll try to win a place in the final .
we do n't want to stop now .
this is so beautiful , we want to carry it on , " he said after the win over brazil . zidane and les bleus will have to defeat surprise team portugal to carry on .
no small task considering that their coach is luiz felipe scolari , the man who led brazil to their 2002 world cup title .
scolari has instilled what he has called a " warrior spirit " in the portugal squad that is trying to better their best world cup performance , a third-place finish , 40 years ago . " we have a good team and can go even further as we advance , " the man known as " big phil " said after the penalty shootout win over england . that 's more than can be said for pre-tournament south american picks brazil and argentina .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .
but there is responsibility .
germany must become the leading country in the fight against anti-semitism .

france knocked out the favorites to make it an all-european semifinals brazil and argentina are packing their bags for home , leaving the 2006 world cup to be battled for amongst four european teams .
with the exception of italy , few people had the europeans on their list of favorites . the favorites entering the world cup 2006 - five-time winner and defending champ brazil and high-flying two-time champs argentina - have been knocked off their thrones .
coming to germany with the hope of keeping the title on their home continent , the selecao and the argentineans must watch how europe will reclaim the trophy that has been bouncing back and forth between the continents of south america and europe since brazil 's victory in chile in 1962 . four european countries , hosts germany , three-time victors italy , 1998 winners france , and surprising portugal , have gained the right to fight for soccer 's most prestigious prize , an improbable possibility just over three weeks ago before the cup 's opening match between germany and costa rica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only pure dejection could describe germany after a 4-1 loss in florence it will be the first time since 1982 that four european teams stand alone in the semifinals of the world cup .

to get there , the two teams beat poland and france respectively . a chance for retribution the 1982 champs , italy , are the only team that people had on their lists of favorites entering the tournament .

of the seven matches the squadra azzurra have been forced to face the hosts , they have won just once , a 1-0 win against argentina in the group phase in 1978 .
the italians hope to improve on that unimpressive series against germany on tuesday . speaking of series , germany ended one of their darkest by beating argentina on penalties to go through to the semifinals .
that victory put a stop to a winless series against the so-called " big " soccer nations that extended back six years . jürgen klinsmann 's squad has been a freight train gaining speed at this world cup .
the next match against italy will give the germans the opportunity to defeat another " big " soccer country - and atone for an embarrassing 4-1 defeat dealt to them by italy in march . " the humiliation of that defeat is still painful , " said midfielder torsten frings .
" but we 're so fit now , so well prepared , that we know it is not going to happen again .

yet , " zizou " , who will be retiring after this tournament , has risen to the occasion , proving to be the key player in their two knockout stage victories over spain and brazil . " we fought closely together for a well-deserved victory .
now we 'll try to win a place in the final .
we do n't want to stop now .
this is so beautiful , we want to carry it on , " he said after the win over brazil . zidane and les bleus will have to defeat surprise team portugal to carry on .
no small task considering that their coach is luiz felipe scolari , the man who led brazil to their 2002 world cup title .
scolari has instilled what he has called a " warrior spirit " in the portugal squad that is trying to better their best world cup performance , a third-place finish , 40 years ago . " we have a good team and can go even further as we advance , " the man known as " big phil " said after the penalty shootout win over england . that 's more than can be said for pre-tournament south american picks brazil and argentina .

france knocked out the favorites to make it an all-european semifinals brazil and argentina are packing their bags for home , leaving the 2006 world cup to be battled for amongst four european teams .
with the exception of italy , few people had the europeans on their list of favorites . the favorites entering the world cup 2006 - five-time winner and defending champ brazil and high-flying two-time champs argentina - have been knocked off their thrones .
coming to germany with the hope of keeping the title on their home continent , the selecao and the argentineans must watch how europe will reclaim the trophy that has been bouncing back and forth between the continents of south america and europe since brazil 's victory in chile in 1962 . four european countries , hosts germany , three-time victors italy , 1998 winners france , and surprising portugal , have gained the right to fight for soccer 's most prestigious prize , an improbable possibility just over three weeks ago before the cup 's opening match between germany and costa rica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only pure dejection could describe germany after a 4-1 loss in florence it will be the first time since 1982 that four european teams stand alone in the semifinals of the world cup .
then in spain , italy defeated germany 3-1 in the final .
to get there , the two teams beat poland and france respectively . a chance for retribution the 1982 champs , italy , are the only team that people had on their lists of favorites entering the tournament .
marcello lippi 's azzurri also were the only side to breeze through to the final four with their 3-0 victory against ukraine .
yet , the italians have had little luck against host countries at the world cup .
of the seven matches the squadra azzurra have been forced to face the hosts , they have won just once , a 1-0 win against argentina in the group phase in 1978 .
the italians hope to improve on that unimpressive series against germany on tuesday . speaking of series , germany ended one of their darkest by beating argentina on penalties to go through to the semifinals .
that victory put a stop to a winless series against the so-called " big " soccer nations that extended back six years . jürgen klinsmann 's squad has been a freight train gaining speed at this world cup .
the next match against italy will give the germans the opportunity to defeat another " big " soccer country - and atone for an embarrassing 4-1 defeat dealt to them by italy in march . " the humiliation of that defeat is still painful , " said midfielder torsten frings .
" but we 're so fit now , so well prepared , that we know it is not going to happen again . " the surprises keep coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old boys barthez and zidane have carried france to the semis what many people thought would never happen again was seeing france 's zinedine zidane just one game away from another world cup final .
yet , " zizou " , who will be retiring after this tournament , has risen to the occasion , proving to be the key player in their two knockout stage victories over spain and brazil . " we fought closely together for a well-deserved victory .
now we 'll try to win a place in the final .
we do n't want to stop now .
this is so beautiful , we want to carry it on , " he said after the win over brazil . zidane and les bleus will have to defeat surprise team portugal to carry on .
no small task considering that their coach is luiz felipe scolari , the man who led brazil to their 2002 world cup title .
scolari has instilled what he has called a " warrior spirit " in the portugal squad that is trying to better their best world cup performance , a third-place finish , 40 years ago . " we have a good team and can go even further as we advance , " the man known as " big phil " said after the penalty shootout win over england . that 's more than can be said for pre-tournament south american picks brazil and argentina .

" he is not somebody who gives up easily .
he 's extremely pugnacious , like a bulldog who wo n't let go , " a former colleague said . " when forgeard was at airbus , his plan was simple - to be the world 's number one - and he succeeded . " tensions with german partners his nomination at the head of eads sparked tensions with the german partners in the company , with daimlerchrysler suspecting him of seeking to undermine the group 's joint french-german management structure . the germans accused him of trying to mount a coup when he questioned the two-headed leadership of the group and of trying , without success , to arrange a merger with thales . but the delays to the a380 , the problems with the a350 which is having to be radically reviewed , and the timing of the sale of the stock options cast a long shadow over his performance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de franco-german economic marriage hits a rough patch the franco-german aerospace giant eads has hit a patch of turbulence .

pope benedict has decided to open all vatican archives from 1922-1939 .
the secret archives should offer new insight into the catholic church 's actions in europe during the rise of nazism . the vatican said on friday that it will open its central files , known as the secret archives , as well as files of its secretariat of state for the 17-year papacy of pius xi , who died in 1939 .
in a short announcement , it said the opening would " make available for historical research … all documentary sources until february 1939 that are stored in different series of the archives of the holy see . " parts of the archives can already be consulted by researchers but the documents to be made available from september are expected to shed new light on the vatican 's diplomatic activities in the run-up to world war ii . wartime archives off-limits historians have long pushed the vatican to open its wartime archives to answer questions about what the catholic church knew about the nazi persecution of europe 's jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pius xii 's wartime papacy has been attacked by critics however the archives of the pontificate of pius xi 's successor , pius xii , whom critics accuse of failing to help the jews , will remain closed for the time being . " i welcome the decision to release the documents , but urge the vatican to do more , " rabbi marvien hier , dean of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , told reuters . heir said that while the new documents would shed light on the church 's activities leading up to the war , it was pius xii 's actions during the war that were of crucial importance .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .
but there is responsibility .
germany must become the leading country in the fight against anti-semitism .

rabbi leo trepp , a holocaust survivor , has close ties to the country he was once forced to flee . rabbi leo trepp , 93 , is a holocaust survivor .
he was forced to flee nazi germany in 1938 and made his way to california , where he continued to work as a rabbi , eventually becoming a professor of jewish theology and philosophy .
trepp is the last living rabbi to have survived the holocaust .
he has been active in jewish-christian dialogue in germany for decades . face to face with hate nazi germany , 1938 : leo trepp , a young rabbi in oldenburg , is forced together with all the jewish men in the city to march past the destroyed synagogue where he had preached .
after that he is imprisoned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 100 neo-nazis demonstrated last september in oldenburg , where leo trepp was arrested by the nazis in 1938 now 93 years old , trepp remembers the atrocious details .
" the commandant came out and shouted such a horrible speech at us .
he said , ' you are the scum of humanity !
you do n't even deserve to be alive ! '
i had the feeling that next he was going to tell his gunmen to shoot us all , " he said . " but god was with me in the concentration camp .
i told him , ' dear god , i 'll die for you , if needed . '
but he did n't let us get shot . " recovering the past and ensuring the future trepp lived in constant fear during that time .
his congregation was disbanded and the synagogue was torched .
unlike so many other jews , the nazis let him live . after three weeks in the concentration camp , trepp immigrated with his wife to england and then on to the us .
in california , he worked as a rabbi and later became a philosophy professor .
but he did n't forget what he had seen and experienced . from the 1950 's on , he visited germany from time to time - even though his mother had been murdered there by the nazis .
he currently lectures at the university of mainz as an honorary professor and focuses especially on teaching young christian theologians . but there is yet another topic that he passionately dedicates himself to : the old liturgical music from the jewish congregation in mainz that was passed on orally for generations .
this musical tradition had disappeared along with the obliterated mainz synagogue .
but trepp collected the liturgical melodies and published them in 2004 in the form of sheet music accompanied by a cd recording . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial in berlin , completed in may 2005 , is an abstract work comprised of 2,700 concrete blocks no guilt , but responsibility trepp has been active in jewish-christian dialogue for years .
with standard publications like " the history of german jews " and " the jewish worship service " , he has contributed significantly to a greater understanding of judaism , particularly among non-jews .
however , trepp is concerned about growing prejudice against jews , even in germany . " anti-semitism has become acceptable again - by nationalists on the one hand and , on the other hand , by islamists .
israel and the jews are viewed as scapegoats .
sometimes i ask myself : has what i 've done had any impact ? " the christian religion instructors and pastors that rabbi trepp has taught at the university of mainz have encouraged him to fight against anti-semitism .
and he also has a message for them , and for other young people in germany : " you bear no guilt for what your grandparents did .

the terror network posed " an extremely serious and brutal threat " to the uk , the latest foreign affairs committee report into the " war on terror " found .
tackling this threat would become more difficult in the future , it concluded .
one reason was propaganda coming from iraq which is a crucial training ground for international terrorists , it said .
committee chairman mike gapes said al-qaeda had now broken up into smaller groups which were harder to trace .
" we feel that there is a problem that , although there 's been some successes , al-qaeda as a concept is actually more of a threat now than it was before . "
deteriorating security the report also argued that too little effort was being put into communicating with the arab and islamic world to counter terrorist propaganda .
it said the continued existence of guantanamo bay detention centre diminished us moral authority and added to the list of grievances .
the committee also expresses concerns over the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the arrival there of violent tactics pioneered by militants in iraq .
the mps called on the government to clarify the objectives for the british troops who were recently deployed in afghanistan .
military action -lrb- against iran -rrb- would be likely to unleash a host of extremely serious consequences both in the middle east and elsewhere foreign affairs committee in its response to the report , the government should set out the circumstances under which it would withdraw uk troops from iraq , the committee recommended .
former government intelligence analyst , crispin black , told the bbc more work needed to be done to reach people who may be persuaded by extremist views .
" what we need to do is to try and communicate directly to the kind of people who might be influenced at some point by the al qaeda world picture a sense of our strong good faith , and our sense of really wanting a peaceful and democratic middle east for everybody , " he said .
fabian hamilton mp , who sits on the foreign affairs committee , said the war on terror in iraq was fuelling extremist groups .
he said : " it increases that sense that those terror groups have , that this is a war against islam by the west , something not shared by pretty well every member of the islamic faith in great britain and most of europe .
" but that 's the way they feel , that 's the proposal they put forward and of course iraq just makes that worse " .
' extremely worrying ' the foreign affairs committee called the " continuing deterioration of the security situation " in iraq and its deepening sectarian and ethnic conflicts " extremely worrying " .
it called on the government to respond to other issues in the report , including the level of detentions by coalition forces .
iran was also a subject of the report , with the committee expressing concern " about the iranian involvement in iraq and that the organisation , weaponry and technology for a number of terrorist incidents in iraq have come from within iran " .
the mps said that iran 's position towards the war against terrorism had " been contradictory , and extremely unhelpful in a number of key areas " .
there was also " clear cause for concern " over iranian nuclear intentions , the mps said .
however , the committee commended the co-operation between the uk , france and germany in their negotiations with iran .
the mps said : " military action would be likely to unleash a host of extremely serious consequences both in the middle east and elsewhere , and would not be guaranteed to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons in the long term . "
the government should not undertake or support military action against iran " until all other options have been exhausted or without broad agreement " among its international allies , " the committee said .
" government should also make these points absolutely clear to the administration in washington , " the mps added .

the terror network posed " an extremely serious and brutal threat " to the uk , the latest foreign affairs committee report into the " war on terror " found .
tackling this threat would become more difficult in the future , it concluded .
one reason was propaganda coming from iraq which is a crucial training ground for international terrorists , it said .
committee chairman mike gapes said al-qaeda had now broken up into smaller groups which were harder to trace .
" we feel that there is a problem that , although there 's been some successes , al-qaeda as a concept is actually more of a threat now than it was before . "
deteriorating security the report also argued that too little effort was being put into communicating with the arab and islamic world to counter terrorist propaganda .
it said the continued existence of guantanamo bay detention centre diminished us moral authority and added to the list of grievances .
the committee also expresses concerns over the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the arrival there of violent tactics pioneered by militants in iraq .
the mps called on the government to clarify the objectives for the british troops who were recently deployed in afghanistan .
military action -lrb- against iran -rrb- would be likely to unleash a host of extremely serious consequences both in the middle east and elsewhere foreign affairs committee in its response to the report , the government should set out the circumstances under which it would withdraw uk troops from iraq , the committee recommended .
former government intelligence analyst , crispin black , told the bbc more work needed to be done to reach people who may be persuaded by extremist views .
" what we need to do is to try and communicate directly to the kind of people who might be influenced at some point by the al qaeda world picture a sense of our strong good faith , and our sense of really wanting a peaceful and democratic middle east for everybody , " he said .
fabian hamilton mp , who sits on the foreign affairs committee , said the war on terror in iraq was fuelling extremist groups .
he said : " it increases that sense that those terror groups have , that this is a war against islam by the west , something not shared by pretty well every member of the islamic faith in great britain and most of europe .
" but that 's the way they feel , that 's the proposal they put forward and of course iraq just makes that worse " .
' extremely worrying ' the foreign affairs committee called the " continuing deterioration of the security situation " in iraq and its deepening sectarian and ethnic conflicts " extremely worrying " .
it called on the government to respond to other issues in the report , including the level of detentions by coalition forces .
iran was also a subject of the report , with the committee expressing concern " about the iranian involvement in iraq and that the organisation , weaponry and technology for a number of terrorist incidents in iraq have come from within iran " .
the mps said that iran 's position towards the war against terrorism had " been contradictory , and extremely unhelpful in a number of key areas " .
there was also " clear cause for concern " over iranian nuclear intentions , the mps said .
however , the committee commended the co-operation between the uk , france and germany in their negotiations with iran .
the mps said : " military action would be likely to unleash a host of extremely serious consequences both in the middle east and elsewhere , and would not be guaranteed to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons in the long term . "
the government should not undertake or support military action against iran " until all other options have been exhausted or without broad agreement " among its international allies , " the committee said .
" government should also make these points absolutely clear to the administration in washington , " the mps added .

mark sharp , 45 , a heavy goods driver from nottingham , said : " we never win on penalties , do we ?
" i knew as soon as it went to penalties , that was it . "
in harlesden , north london , the mood was celebratory as jubilant portuguese fans drove up and down the high street cheering , and waving flags from their cars .
but in bolton , greater manchester , up to 500 drunken football fans attacked police in a major disturbance .
police say they were overwhelmed by the trouble which lasted for around two and a half hours .

the mother of three said she was feeling good after enduring high temperatures while covering 80 miles in california in 10 hours .
mrs tomlinson , 42 , of rothwell , leeds , is on her toughest challenge yet .
she and two companions now face a climb to 8,573ft at carson pass after they pass through sierra nevada .
she is joined on the 62-day ride by two friends - leeds metropolitan university lecturer ryan bowd , 27 , of calgary , canada , and 40-year-old martyn hollingworth from huddersfield , west yorkshire .
mrs tomlinson 's husband mike , 45 , said : " they 've been trying to get ahead of themselves to give them extra time to do the climb . "
it is not known how the higher altitude will affect mrs tomlinson 's heart condition , caused by the drug regime which has seen her undergo four courses of chemotherapy in the last six years .
" with the climb and the fact that jane has the heart condition , we do n't know what the risks are , " mr tomlinson said .
" we think it should be all right though .
it will allow her to adjust a little to the higher altitude before the bigger climbs later on .
the trio , who expect to arrive in new york in september , covered more than 140 miles of the journey in the first three days .

but can poland afford to let its skilled workforce settle permanently in the uk ?
kasia tabor is about to say goodbye to the sun-drenched garden in dzierzoniow where her children cyprian , aged nine , and martyna , six , have played all the summers of their lives .
she is going to join her husband adam who moved to nottingham two years ago .
she barely speaks a word of english and she does not know where she will be living .
but she is gradually becoming convinced there is no future for them at home .
kasia is following in the footsteps of probably half a million poles who have moved to britain after poland joined the eu in 2004 .
many of them are only temporary migrants who return home after a few months .
but evidence is mounting that increasing numbers see their long-term future in the uk .
at first the exodus suited everyone - the uk gained badly-needed labour for workplaces from cafes to operating theatres , and poland found a solution to its 17 % unemployment , the highest in the eu .
but now , poland is becoming alarmed that it may be seriously damaged by the departure of so many of its brightest and most energetic citizens .
and the exodus is beginning to spark painful questions about where the country is going wrong .
poland 's ombudsman flew in to the uk to see for himself how the emigrants are faring .
high unemployment dzierzoniow , a town of about 35,000 people in south-west poland , is a typical point of departure for migrants to britain .
between 500 and 1,000 have already left , fleeing a place where most factories closed after the fall of communism and one in four people is jobless .
" we are not saying we will never return here , " says kasia .
" but for now we just can not have a normal life here . "
her husband used to be a primary school teacher earning 900 zloty a month - about £ 180 -lrb- $ 330 -rrb- .
he is now earning over £ 1,000 in a recycling plant in nottingham .
he intended to stay only a few months , but like many other migrants his life has now improved so much he has no definite plans to go home .
in one recent survey of polish migrants to britain , nearly half those questioned would not say when they were returning home , suggesting they were at least considering staying long-term .
brain drain now rafal dutkiewicz , the mayor of poland 's fourth-largest city wroclaw - an hour 's drive from dzerzionow - is so worried that he is planning to travel to britain in the autumn to urge young migrants to come home . "
the quality of life here is quite high and will be much higher in the future " rafal dutkiewicz , mayor of wroclaw " most probably not today , not tomorrow , but the day after , we will need more people , " he says .
he admits it will take 10 years before polish wages approach those in western europe .
but he says migrants should come home for other reasons .
" the quality of life here is quite high and will be much higher in the future .
and the possibilities for improving your professional career are much greater here than in western europe . "
but the real crisis is in medicine .
a doctor with over seven years experience can earn as little as £ 200 a month .
in the last two years nearly 10 % of the doctors in the lower silesia region , which includes wroclaw , have left the country .
among anaesthetists the figure is even higher - one in four has emigrated .
replicate this number across all of poland 's regions and the health service could soon be in a critical condition .
already there are some cases of anaesthetists having to deal with more than one operation at once - putting patients at serious risk .
gone forever ?
the man responsible for poland 's youngest generation - education minister and deputy prime minister roman giertych - blames the exodus on the eu , not on poland itself . "
it is necessary to create some programme to stop the brain drain " polish deputy prime minister roman giertych " this is why i was against joining the eu .
there is a danger many people may never come back home , " he says .
" for great britain that may even be good news as they are intelligent and not as problematic as muslim immigrants .
but it is necessary to create some programme to stop the brain drain .
poland needs to think about this herself - or propose the idea to the eu . "
it is most unlikely the eu would consider any new restrictions on the free movement of labour .
but its plans to pour funds into poland in the next few years may do much to reduce the problem of migration .
back in wroclaw , mayor dutkiewicz is counting on growth rates of 7-8 % a year .
" i am sure with huge development we will get people back , " he predicts .
" it happened in ireland - in the 80s many young people left but they came back in the 90s when ireland really started to prosper .
i am sure they will come back . "
but his optimism is not enough to persuade kasia tabor to stay .
having shared a house for years with her parents or her in-laws , she thinks she and adam are far more likely to get a place of their own in nottingham than down the road in wroclaw .
" if there are jobs here - and they 're real jobs , not just possibilities at some point in the future , we 'd come back , " she says .
" but it ca n't be just promises . "

but can poland afford to let its skilled workforce settle permanently in the uk ?
kasia 's husband has no definite plans to return home to poland kasia tabor is about to say goodbye to the sun-drenched garden in dzierzoniow where her children cyprian , aged nine , and martyna , six , have played all the summers of their lives .
she is going to join her husband adam who moved to nottingham two years ago .
she barely speaks a word of english and she does not know where she will be living .
but she is gradually becoming convinced there is no future for them at home .
kasia is following in the footsteps of probably half a million poles who have moved to britain after poland joined the eu in 2004 .
many of them are only temporary migrants who return home after a few months .
but evidence is mounting that increasing numbers see their long-term future in the uk .
at first the exodus suited everyone - the uk gained badly-needed labour for workplaces from cafes to operating theatres , and poland found a solution to its 17 % unemployment , the highest in the eu .
but now , poland is becoming alarmed that it may be seriously damaged by the departure of so many of its brightest and most energetic citizens .
and the exodus is beginning to spark painful questions about where the country is going wrong .
poland 's ombudsman flew in to the uk to see for himself how the emigrants are faring .
high unemployment dzierzoniow , a town of about 35,000 people in south-west poland , is a typical point of departure for migrants to britain .
polish workers have left dzierzoniow in search of a better life between 500 and 1,000 have already left , fleeing a place where most factories closed after the fall of communism and one in four people is jobless .
" we are not saying we will never return here , " says kasia .
" but for now we just can not have a normal life here . "
her husband used to be a primary school teacher earning 900 zloty a month - about £ 180 -lrb- $ 330 -rrb- .
he is now earning over £ 1,000 in a recycling plant in nottingham .
he intended to stay only a few months , but like many other migrants his life has now improved so much he has no definite plans to go home .
in one recent survey of polish migrants to britain , nearly half those questioned would not say when they were returning home , suggesting they were at least considering staying long-term .
brain drain now rafal dutkiewicz , the mayor of poland 's fourth-largest city wroclaw - an hour 's drive from dzerzionow - is so worried that he is planning to travel to britain in the autumn to urge young migrants to come home .
the quality of life here is quite high and will be much higher in the future rafal dutkiewicz , mayor of wroclaw " most probably not today , not tomorrow , but the day after , we will need more people , " he says .
he admits it will take 10 years before polish wages approach those in western europe .
but he says migrants should come home for other reasons .
" the quality of life here is quite high and will be much higher in the future .
and the possibilities for improving your professional career are much greater here than in western europe . "
but the real crisis is in medicine .
a doctor with over seven years experience can earn as little as £ 200 a month .
in the last two years nearly 10 % of the doctors in the lower silesia region , which includes wroclaw , have left the country .
among anaesthetists the figure is even higher - one in four has emigrated .
replicate this number across all of poland 's regions and the health service could soon be in a critical condition .
already there are some cases of anaesthetists having to deal with more than one operation at once - putting patients at serious risk .
gone forever ?
the man responsible for poland 's youngest generation - education minister and deputy prime minister roman giertych - blames the exodus on the eu , not on poland itself .
it is necessary to create some programme to stop the brain drain polish deputy prime minister roman giertych " this is why i was against joining the eu .
there is a danger many people may never come back home , " he says .
" for great britain that may even be good news as they are intelligent and not as problematic as muslim immigrants .
but it is necessary to create some programme to stop the brain drain .
poland needs to think about this herself - or propose the idea to the eu . "
it is most unlikely the eu would consider any new restrictions on the free movement of labour .
but its plans to pour funds into poland in the next few years may do much to reduce the problem of migration .
back in wroclaw , mayor dutkiewicz is counting on growth rates of 7-8 % a year .
" i am sure with huge development we will get people back , " he predicts .
" it happened in ireland - in the 80s many young people left but they came back in the 90s when ireland really started to prosper .
i am sure they will come back . "
but his optimism is not enough to persuade kasia tabor to stay .
having shared a house for years with her parents or her in-laws , she thinks she and adam are far more likely to get a place of their own in nottingham than down the road in wroclaw .
" if there are jobs here - and they 're real jobs , not just possibilities at some point in the future , we 'd come back , " she says .
" but it ca n't be just promises . "

by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news website this weekend is the first anniversary of live 8 , when the world 's biggest pop stars performed at 10 concerts around the world to raise awareness of poverty in africa .
on 2 july 2005 , u2 joined forces with sir paul mccartney in london , madonna embraced a survivor of the 1984 ethiopian famine and crowds enjoyed the gig of a lifetime while saving the world in the process .
organisers said three billion people watched on tv , an estimated 1.5 million attended the concerts in person and more than 30 million signed up to the text and web petition , the live 8 list .
six days later , the world 's richest nations - who the concerts were designed to influence - announced measures including $ 50bn -lrb- £ 28.8bn -rrb- extra aid for africa plus measures on debt , trade and health .
mass media attention but now , bob geldof says the g8 countries are " all off track " in their progress to meet the commitments .
so did live 8 really make a difference ?
or did the public enjoy the music but soon forget the message , allowing politicians to do likewise ?
have your say on live 8 's legacy " did live 8 work ? "
geldof asks .
" yes it did .
" are more people being fed today because of live 8 ?
are they less hungry because of what we did last year ?
yes they are .
" are more children in school because of what we did last year ?
are more people being treated for diseases across the board ?
yes they are .
" that 's good for me .
but it is n't enough because the full promises must be implemented and nothing less will do . "
midge ure , geldof 's sidekick in organising both live 8 and the original live aid concert 21 years ago , says last year 's event succeeded in raising awareness about the cause .
" getting mass media to focus on a particular problem is a very , very difficult thing to do and i think that was done amazingly , " he says .
' change in attitude ' but public attention was quickly diverted by the london bombings on 7 july , he says .
" that just left the whole thing dangling , which means for a year no-one 's been quite sure whether it was a political success or not .
" changes were made , which is great , but it all went terribly quiet straight afterwards . "
the public are still passionate about changing the world , he believes .
that feeling is " still immense and very intense " .
" it has n't gone away - it just does n't have the huge media circus that revolved around the whole build-up to the live 8 concerts and g8 summit last year . "
live 8 made people realise that they could do something about poverty , according to barbara stocking , director of oxfam gb , one of the main partners in the make poverty history coalition .
" i think that was the difference , " she says .
" i do n't pretend that everybody 's remembered that , but i think there was a change in attitude . "
" moving on from there , for people like us , the issue is - how do you keep that sense of commitment and involvement going ?
because things wear off after the great event . "
global activists celebrity extravaganzas are valuable because they attract more attention than charities could on their own , she says .
there is now " a lot more interest " in poverty and other global issues as a result , she says .
but she adds : " keeping the public really engaged and interested to such an extent that the politicians feel moved to keep on is still quite hard . "
live 8 has not been without his critics .
radiohead singer thom yorke recently said his band did not take part because he " did n't agree with the idea " .
it was a " form of distraction " to the real business of the g8 , he said .
" holding a big rock concert and reducing the issues to bare essential levels , i think , ultimately , was to the detriment of the campaign . "
but geldof says live 8 had " political and social reverberations " as well as influencing g8 leaders .
it inspired the one campaign in the us , which has educated a generation of young americans about global poverty and is on course to become the world 's largest lobby group , according to the irish singer .
" to dismiss any of these things as being meaningless is ridiculous , " he says .
" twenty years ago a bunch of us jumped on a stage and wanted some money to stop people dying of hunger .
" it is now the debated topic at the highest level of global politics and it is pursued by the global activist movement that constantly grows in exponential numbers .
" and this is something that is part of the end tally of live 8 . "

" i do n't pretend that everybody 's remembered that , but i think there was a change in attitude . "

it was a " form of distraction " to the real business of the g8 , he said .

but geldof says live 8 had " political and social reverberations " as well as influencing g8 leaders .
it inspired the one campaign in the us , which has educated a generation of young americans about global poverty and is on course to become the world 's largest lobby group , according to the irish singer .
" to dismiss any of these things as being meaningless is ridiculous , " he says .
" twenty years ago a bunch of us jumped on a stage and wanted some money to stop people dying of hunger .

by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news website this weekend is the first anniversary of live 8 , when the world 's biggest pop stars performed at 10 concerts around the world to raise awareness of poverty in africa .
madonna famously embraced ethiopian birhan woldu at live 8 on 2 july 2005 , u2 joined forces with sir paul mccartney in london , madonna embraced a survivor of the 1984 ethiopian famine and crowds enjoyed the gig of a lifetime while saving the world in the process .
organisers said three billion people watched on tv , an estimated 1.5 million attended the concerts in person and more than 30 million signed up to the text and web petition , the live 8 list .
six days later , the world 's richest nations - who the concerts were designed to influence - announced measures including $ 50bn -lrb- £ 28.8bn -rrb- extra aid for africa plus measures on debt , trade and health .
mass media attention but now , bob geldof says the g8 countries are " all off track " in their progress to meet the commitments .
so did live 8 really make a difference ?
or did the public enjoy the music but soon forget the message , allowing politicians to do likewise ?
have your say on live 8 's legacy " did live 8 work ? "
geldof asks .
" yes it did .
" are more people being fed today because of live 8 ?
are they less hungry because of what we did last year ?
yes they are .
" are more children in school because of what we did last year ?
are more people being treated for diseases across the board ?
yes they are .
" that 's good for me .
but it is n't enough because the full promises must be implemented and nothing less will do . "
midge ure , geldof 's sidekick in organising both live 8 and the original live aid concert 21 years ago , says last year 's event succeeded in raising awareness about the cause .
up to a million people attended the live 8 concert in philadelphia " getting mass media to focus on a particular problem is a very , very difficult thing to do and i think that was done amazingly , " he says .
' change in attitude ' but public attention was quickly diverted by the london bombings on 7 july , he says .
" that just left the whole thing dangling , which means for a year no-one 's been quite sure whether it was a political success or not .
" changes were made , which is great , but it all went terribly quiet straight afterwards . "
the public are still passionate about changing the world , he believes .
that feeling is " still immense and very intense " .
" it has n't gone away - it just does n't have the huge media circus that revolved around the whole build-up to the live 8 concerts and g8 summit last year . "
live 8 made people realise that they could do something about poverty , according to barbara stocking , director of oxfam gb , one of the main partners in the make poverty history coalition .
sir paul mccartney was one of the star attractions in london " i think that was the difference , " she says .
" i do n't pretend that everybody 's remembered that , but i think there was a change in attitude . "
" moving on from there , for people like us , the issue is - how do you keep that sense of commitment and involvement going ?
because things wear off after the great event . "
global activists celebrity extravaganzas are valuable because they attract more attention than charities could on their own , she says .
there is now " a lot more interest " in poverty and other global issues as a result , she says .
but she adds : " keeping the public really engaged and interested to such an extent that the politicians feel moved to keep on is still quite hard . "
live 8 has not been without his critics .
radiohead singer thom yorke recently said his band did not take part because he " did n't agree with the idea " .
it was a " form of distraction " to the real business of the g8 , he said .
geldof says the crowd remembered the message as well as the music " holding a big rock concert and reducing the issues to bare essential levels , i think , ultimately , was to the detriment of the campaign . "
but geldof says live 8 had " political and social reverberations " as well as influencing g8 leaders .
it inspired the one campaign in the us , which has educated a generation of young americans about global poverty and is on course to become the world 's largest lobby group , according to the irish singer .
" to dismiss any of these things as being meaningless is ridiculous , " he says .
" twenty years ago a bunch of us jumped on a stage and wanted some money to stop people dying of hunger .
" it is now the debated topic at the highest level of global politics and it is pursued by the global activist movement that constantly grows in exponential numbers .
" and this is something that is part of the end tally of live 8 . "
