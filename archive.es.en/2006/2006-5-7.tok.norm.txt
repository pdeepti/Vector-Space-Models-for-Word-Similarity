animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .

" ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .
final reach legislation is expected to be passed by the end of 2006 . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .

" the germans just do n't like war - no matter where they are in terms of the political spectrum .
i can understand that .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .
if france and germany can do it , other countries might soon follow suit . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fortifying franco-german relations german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed french president jacques chirac to his hometown of blomberg on monday .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .
if france and germany can do it , other countries might soon follow suit . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fortifying franco-german relations german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed french president jacques chirac to his hometown of blomberg on monday .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2006 germany , france write history together großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toasting to franco-german friendship a joint french-german school textbook was unveiled thursday by the french education minister in peronne - site of a famously horrific world war i battle .
but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .
if france and germany can do it , other countries might soon follow suit . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fortifying franco-german relations german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed french president jacques chirac to his hometown of blomberg on monday .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .
final reach legislation is expected to be passed by the end of 2006 . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .
if france and germany can do it , other countries might soon follow suit . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fortifying franco-german relations german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed french president jacques chirac to his hometown of blomberg on monday .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .
final reach legislation is expected to be passed by the end of 2006 . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2006 germany , france write history together großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toasting to franco-german friendship a joint french-german school textbook was unveiled thursday by the french education minister in peronne - site of a famously horrific world war i battle .
but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .

in the small city on the north frisian coast , a small old house marks a place where the writer located so many of his novels and poems .
the furnishings of the husum merchant houses , in which storm lived and worked from 1866 to 1880 , were often a model for the fixtures in his stories .
he set the novel " viola tricolor " - a complex tale of a young woman who marries a much older widower with children - is set in his living room .

in fact , he placed the family epic in the buildings where his grandmother lived .
in the buddenbrook house , the line between fact and fiction is spectacularly blurred . " visitors are never sure if they are in an exhibition about the mann family or in the world of the buddenbrooks , " said hans wisskirchen of the lübeck thomas and heinrich mann center .
in lübeck , buddenbrook fans can wander through the world of the novel such as the landscape room , the dining room or the column hall .
the exhibit also features multimedia clips from theater , movie and television productions based on the novel . poetry museums in the dithmarschen region dramatist christian friedrich hebbel spent his childhood in the small town of wesselburen .
the former kirchspielvogtei parish , where the creator of dramas such as " judith " and " mary magdalene " spent some of his working years , today hosts a museum devoted to him .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .

" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

" i want your readers to know that i wish and believe that we can solve this diplomatically , " he said , adding later that all options had to remain on the table , however . the international community is engaged in intense diplomatic debate over how to respond to iran 's categoric refusal to suspend uranium enrichment , the process creating fuel for nuclear reactors and - potentially - the core of an atomic bomb . growi n g relatio n ship asked whether he had any particular requests for his visit to merkel 's constituency on the baltic sea coast in eastern germany , bush said that he appreciated the chancellor 's desire to show him the former communist part of the country .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2006 germany , france write history together großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toasting to franco-german friendship a joint french-german school textbook was unveiled thursday by the french education minister in peronne - site of a famously horrific world war i battle .
but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .
if france and germany can do it , other countries might soon follow suit . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fortifying franco-german relations german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed french president jacques chirac to his hometown of blomberg on monday .

in the small city on the north frisian coast , a small old house marks a place where the writer located so many of his novels and poems .
the furnishings of the husum merchant houses , in which storm lived and worked from 1866 to 1880 , were often a model for the fixtures in his stories .
he set the novel " viola tricolor " - a complex tale of a young woman who marries a much older widower with children - is set in his living room .

the exhibit also features multimedia clips from theater , movie and television productions based on the novel . poetry museums in the dithmarschen region dramatist christian friedrich hebbel spent his childhood in the small town of wesselburen .

in the small city on the north frisian coast , a small old house marks a place where the writer located so many of his novels and poems .
the furnishings of the husum merchant houses , in which storm lived and worked from 1866 to 1880 , were often a model for the fixtures in his stories .

but banishing historical demons is what it 's all about . an educational milestone , " histoire / geschichte : europe and the world since 1945 " is a high school textbook that explores the two countries ' post-war history , while two further books on pre-1945 history are currently in the pipeline . choosing to focus on these years was a brave move , given that national interpretations of world war ii and its aftermath are notoriously different from country to country . but french and german authors rose to the challenge , producing the world 's first history book co-written by two countries . " the big lesson is that nothing is written in stone , " said french education minister gilles de robien .
" the antagonisms which we thought had been carved into marble are not eternal , and it 's possible to write new pages in the books of the peoples . " pitfalls a clash of perspectives and political agenda might have seemed inevitable .
but surprisingly , french newspaper figaro quoted the project 's co-director guillaume le quintrec as saying , the main bone of contention was actually the depiction of the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been accused of being pro-american " the french found the germans to be pro-american , and the germans found our viewpoint to be anti-american , " he said . differences in educational styles also proved problematic , with the authors realizing that while german teachers encourage students to debate , their french counterparts tend to be stricter and more authoritarian . fostering ties the idea for the project was born three years ago at the european youth parliament in strasbourg , when teenage participants agreed on a need to accentuate what unites europe rather than what divides it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac shared a strong bond the proposal was welcomed both by french president jacques chirac and then chancellor gerhard schröder - two fervent believers in the franco-german axis - and given the green light just one year later . " it was not easy because of the complexity of the german and french school systems , " a spokesman from the german embassy in paris told the bbc .
" but both leaders really threw their weight behind the project . " writing history together two years in development , the french edition was completed first , with the german version set to be published on july 10 , and actual classroom launch scheduled for autumn 2007 . the textbook , designed to foster ties and boost a sense of european identity , is geared to german and french students in the last three years of high school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaping political consciousness " for the first time in the world , two nations are writing history together , " peter müller , germany 's chief representative for cultural affairs to france , told reuters .
" this book allows us to understand even better the partner country and its history . " although the goal is to emphasize the french-german friendship , the textbook does n't shy away from the more turbulent aspects of past-war history - nor does it slide into franco-german centricity . " the book looks at the whole of europe and the world , " said history teacher frederic munier from the henry iv lycee in paris .
" the cover features kohl and mitterand in verdun , as well as the berlin wall , but it also shows israelis and palestinians ! " if it proves successful , " histoire / geschichte " may be the first of many similar projects .
if france and germany can do it , other countries might soon follow suit . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : fortifying franco-german relations german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed french president jacques chirac to his hometown of blomberg on monday .

animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary . a test based on the use of stem cells from mice can offer " at least the same amount of information about the possible toxic effects on unborn human life as experiments on mice , rabbits , rats and guinea pigs , " said cologne-based physician heribert bohlen , one of the co-developers of the new " r.e.tox " method .
in addition to saving animal lives , bohlen says testing using the new stem cell technology is more economical than conventional animal experiments . the tüv rheinland group and the cologne research company axiogenesis developed the r.e.tox method to study the effects of chemicals on the unborn .
the developers claim that the method can show whether or not a substance damages cells or hinders their development .
tüv director bruno braun said that the european centre for the validation of alternative methods -lrb- ecvam -rrb- had already confirmed the effectiveness of the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinea pigs are a prime object for research experiments ecvam is an institution that was created based on a european union directive calling for the development , validation and acceptance of methods which could reduce , refine or replace the use of laboratory animals . a humane alternative roman kolar , a biologist and deputy director of the animal welfare academy near munich , says that while the stem cell method is very welcome , he is quick to point out that it is not new . " ecvam confirmed back in 2001 that stem cell tests for embryotoxicity work , " kolar said , but conceded that " such testing can indeed save many , many animals ' lives . " bohlen estimates that " to achieve the same information that the r.e.tox method produces , one would have to conduct experiments on 150 to 300 animals for just one substance .
we can therefore save hundreds of thousands of animal lives in the future . " however , the ecvam said in a statement that in vitro testing methods for embryotoxicity " do not represent replacements for current animals test for reproductive toxicity as a whole . " bildunterschrift : rats in a research lab in frankfurt animal testing still widespread while animal welfare activists are happy when animals ' lives can be saved , regardless of the number , they emphasize that wide-spread testing on animals still continues . according to kolar , screening for potentially embryotoxic substances and their classification is " just a very small area of all the experiments conducted on animals . " " animal use in science ranges from regulatory compound testing to basic research on monkeys ' brains , " he added . kolar also stressed that while it is commendable that the axiogenesis company has developed its own version of testing embryotoxity using mice stem cells , they intend to use that version exclusively inside their own laboratories . but he also pointed out that this makes the official acceptance of the method - which is normally intended for eu-wide use - problematic due to the lack of transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice stem cells behave similarly to human ones the reach list while the r.e.tox method can now be applied in the commercial sector , the tüv rheinland group hopes the method will also be put on the " reach " list of acceptable testing methods . reach is a european union " ordinance on registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals " which has yet to be fully passed , but which would - upon approval - require the testing of at least 30,000 chemicals already on the market . up to 6,000 different substances would have to be analyzed as to whether they would adversely affect fertility or an embryo 's development .
final reach legislation is expected to be passed by the end of 2006 . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .

in the days leading up to thursday 's local election polls , labour councillors , mps and party workers in west and south yorkshire were looking decidedly glum .
though none would openly say so , it 's safe to assume that they were expecting substantial losses - particularly in the heartland cities of sheffield and hull .
so in the early hours of friday morning , sheffield central mp and government minister richard caborn could barely contain his delight that his party were still in charge of the flagship authority in his home town : " in barnsley , doncaster and rotherham we 've done well and we 've still got our majority in sheffield .
" we were told we were going to have meltdown .
it has n't happened . "
click here for local election results in fact , there was no change for labour in sheffield .
carl minns : labour still have the whip hand the liberal democrats did become the largest party in hull by just one seat but their leader on the local council , carl minns , did n't seem overly confident that his party would be taking charge : " we needed four more seats to form an administration .
" there are a number of independents in hull who always vote with labour so at the moment ...
-lrb- labour -rrb- still have the whip hand . "
in harrogate and bradford , it was a bad day for the conservatives as their friday morning counts eventually revealed that they were no longer the biggest parties in both authorities .
in harrogate , the liberal democrats made gains to take the council to no overall control .
in bradford , labour again showed the north 's tendency to go against the grain when the party gained seats to become the biggest party .
however , it could take weeks to sort out who will eventually take charge .
margaret eaton : disappointed not to have made further gains the incumbent tory leader margaret eaton said : " i 'm very disappointed that we have n't made further gains .
i would much prefer to be the largest party . "
however it seems very likely that she will not relinquish control of the council without a fight .
the picture for the far right british national party ended up being a mixed one .
the bnp made two gains in kirklees and scored its first ever seat on leeds council , as well as picking up a new bradford seat in queensbury .
but it also lost two of its bradford seats and one in calderdale .
the greens were delighted with their gain in sheffield at the expense of the liberal democrats .
a single issue group opposing hospital cuts in huddersfield also gained a seat on kirklees council .

the married father-of-two said " unhappiness " at work and losing his hair had contributed to the affair .
in an interview with the sunday times , he said he had regularly considered " throwing in the towel " on his job .
he said his wife , belinda , had thrown her wedding ring at him and tried to hit him on learning of the affair .
mr oaten , who admitted the affair with a male escort in january , told the paper that he had been looking forward to a quiet weekend when he was confronted by journalists from the news of the world .
he said it had not occurred to him to deny the affair but had known his family life " had just been blown apart " . "
the problem was undoubtedly compounded by my dramatic loss of hair in my late thirties " liberal democrat mp mark oaten life as a frontbench mp was a seven-day a week job with " little time to sit down and think about what 's actually going on " , he continued .
" i had a real sense of transferring ownership of my life to the party and i was never able to adjust to becoming public property . "
mr oaten told how , leading up to the affair , he had had " something of a mid-life crisis " .
he added : " i was turning 40 and i really felt that i was losing my youth .
" the problem was undoubtedly compounded by my dramatic loss of hair in my late thirties .
" this really knocked me for six .
i started to look noticeably older . "
the winchester mp , who resigned as the liberal democrat home affairs spokesman following the affair with the 23-year-old rent boy , told the newspaper he accepts he will always be known as a " scandal mp " .

a complex network has developed shipping the phones out of british ports and to west africa .
but once they arrive in the country - and in particularly the capital accra - they are often re-stolen a number of times as a phone-centred crime wave sweeps the city .
" we identified that mobile phones which had been reported as stolen by customers in the uk - and were therefore blocked by the networks - were being exported throughout the world for resale and use in other countries , and this obviously included ghana , " superintendent eddie thompson , of the world 's only dedicated mobile phone crime unit , based in london , told bbc world service 's global perspective programme .
one ongoing inquiry is of an individual exporting through ports , and group exporting the phones through a freight terminal , exporting " quite high volumes of phones , stolen in the uk , out to ghana . "
moto snatches many of the stolen phones end up in accra 's tiptoe lane , known for its second-hand markets and traders of goods of questionable origin .
ademan , one of the traders , explained that he receives supplies from finland , and brand new phones from dubai .
on a good day he will sell four phones , on a bad day none .
the phones end up in the markets of west africa , where they are sold on he said , however , that he does not accept phones to sell unless they are accompanied by a matching charger .
but another trader , alasan , said that he simply sells phones he is given by his brother , who says they come from italy .
" i ca n't know whether they are stolen - i ca n't know that , " he admitted .
but the story of the stolen phone does not end there .
the surge in mobile phone ownership in the country in recent years - some of which has been driven by the availability of stolen european phones - has led to a wave of crime focused solely on snatching the phones from their owners .
gangs of young boys , usually aged 14-16 , ride around the city on " motos " - small motorcycles - targeting people who have handsets in plain sight .
they are often able to snatch them swiftly , and at force , before driving off .
" the bike comes , they go behind the car - the driver did n't even see they were coming - and then they got to the passenger side and snatched the phone with some force , " explained one victim .
" then they sped off , and they were gone .
it came to a level where the police needed to act - and we have acted deputy director of police public affairs kwesi ofori " it happens a lot - they just snatch your phone , and they are gone . "
a former gang leader , razak , told global perspective how easy he had found it to steal the phones .
and if the handset was not clearly visible , they would simply target people 's bags which they would usually keep the phone in .
" i was always looking for phones , every time i stepped outside , " he said ..
" phones are easier than wallets - and often wallets do n't have anything in anyway . "
he explained that the reason his gang had stolen was because " we did n't have any education , and our family had no money - nothing . "
" but i saw it was a bad life , " he added .
this relatively new crime has been working its way up the police priority list in the country .
" it came to a level where the police needed to act - and we have acted , " said accra 's deputy director of police public affairs , kwesi ofori .
" we have put a lot of resources in .
in 2004 , there were 209 reported cases - in 2005 , 417 .
" our anti-armed robbery unit has taken it very seriously , and has arrested a lot of violent gang members for phone snatching .
" we have reduced phone robbery to a level which is encouraging . "
changing attitudes philip boyfi , one of ghana 's biggest mobile phone retailers , explained that until recently many ghanaians were not at all careful about concealing their phones .
" they always want to show off the mobile phone they have got , " he said .
" all my customers want to be able to scream at the top of their voice that they are on cellphones . "
however , following a massive push by the police to educate people of the dangers of using their phone in the street , attitudes are changing .
" you hear of people being threatened at gunpoint for their phone , hit , stabbed with knives , " said fiona entman , one accra citizen who lives not far from tiptoe lane .
" now , it is a bit on the low side .
some months ago it was terrible and everyone was scared - some people did not even take their phones to the office , they just left it at home .
" there was a lot of publication on safety with your mobile phone .
people are now more alert , and even the people who commit such crimes are more alert , because the police are around . "

chief arweh richard says he can speak to the pygmy god , agengi in the dense forest of southern cameroon , chief arweh richard is the final arbiter for his extended family of around 70 people .
every evening he watches affectionately as the young men play football together in front of the camp , and he sometimes joins in , too .
he helps his wife gabba as she prepares the evening meal of bushmeat and boiled cassava .
rather than ruling from an obviously elevated position , the chief seems to understand how inter-connected these people are , both with each other , and with their physical surroundings .
pygmies are among the few remaining hunter-gatherer peoples in africa .
force but whereas some pygmies hunt with a spear or with arrows , chief arweh and his fellow men set traps which they regularly inspect .
much of the religious ceremony which traditionally preceded hunting continues , in spite of the fact that their approach is less dangerous now .
you can take the pygmy man out of the forest , but you ca n't take the forest out of the pygmy man chief arweh richard part of that ceremony involves the rite of a wife praying for her husband 's safety , as she smears some ground bark on to his forehead .
the forest is to be respected - it is not simply a resource , it 's seen as a force which has sustained generations of pygmies .
the force within the forest is called agengi , the god of pygmies everywhere .
whether they are in the democratic republic of congo , gabon , or here in cameroon , chief arweh tells me they can come to the forest and call out to agengi and he will reply to them .
there are different reasons why people might want to do that .
power while i was staying in the village , the chief was frustrated that his other role as the settlement 's traditional healer was these days being neglected .
" people do n't come for healing any more , " he said .
chief arweh richard -lrb- l -rrb- and his son yamma use herbs to make traditional medicine " i used to have lots of people coming for medicine and my treatment .
i was well known for healing people the doctors could n't . "
but in visiting the forest and calling out to agengi - making loud whooping noises - chief arweh and his father antoine and son yamma , believe they connect with their god .
after they have made their call , a startling clapping sound seems to come out of the leaves all around us .
this , i 'm told , is agengi and simply being with him means that some of his power rubs off on you .
later in the week , when chief arweh receives two visitors seeking traditional remedies for their families ' illnesses , he tells me agengi has heard his cry and given him back his role in the community .
chief arweh recognises that the forest not only provides for its people physically with creatures and plants for food , but its god determines their health and well-being in every way .
this symbiotic relationship between the forest surroundings and the forest dwellers , is summed up in a popular phrase the chief told me : " you can take the pygmy man out of the forest , but you ca n't take the forest out of the pygmy man . "

chief arweh richard says he can speak to the pygmy god , agengi in the dense forest of southern cameroon , chief arweh richard is the final arbiter for his extended family of around 70 people .
every evening he watches affectionately as the young men play football together in front of the camp , and he sometimes joins in , too .
he helps his wife gabba as she prepares the evening meal of bushmeat and boiled cassava .
rather than ruling from an obviously elevated position , the chief seems to understand how inter-connected these people are , both with each other , and with their physical surroundings .
pygmies are among the few remaining hunter-gatherer peoples in africa .
force but whereas some pygmies hunt with a spear or with arrows , chief arweh and his fellow men set traps which they regularly inspect .
much of the religious ceremony which traditionally preceded hunting continues , in spite of the fact that their approach is less dangerous now .
you can take the pygmy man out of the forest , but you ca n't take the forest out of the pygmy man chief arweh richard part of that ceremony involves the rite of a wife praying for her husband 's safety , as she smears some ground bark on to his forehead .
the forest is to be respected - it is not simply a resource , it 's seen as a force which has sustained generations of pygmies .
the force within the forest is called agengi , the god of pygmies everywhere .

welsh secretary peter hain said that while he thought having an all-woman shortlist was an honourable objective , labour " got it wrong " .
mr hain told bbc wales ' politics show he was issuing the apology on behalf of labour at the highest levels .
independent peter law defeated labour 's maggie jones at the election .
blaenau gwent was labour 's parliamentary seat in wales , but mr law overturned a 19,000 majority in defeating ms jones .
' listen to people ' mr hain said on sunday : " i 'm saying sorry to them -lrb- people in blaenau gwent -rrb- .
we got it wrong last time .
" we sought to present a choice of women only and we over-rode local party wishes and the wishes of the people of blaenau gwent .
" the first law of politics is you listen to the people .
" the voters are in charge and that is why the selection of our candidate tomorrow night will be entirely by the party in blaenau gwent reflecting the wishes of the people in blaenau gwent which did n't happen last time . "
mr hain said the apology was coming from him " as secretary of state for wales , speaking for welsh labour and on behalf of the national executive , the party leadership and the government " .
in the interview , mr hain also offered an olive branch to those expelled in 2005 for supporting mr law when he left labour over the issue of all-woman shortlists to contest the blaenau gwent seat .
while stopping short of declaring an amnesty , the welsh secretary said there was no reason why those who had been expelled could not come back to labour .
bbc wales understands that further steps will be taken in the coming days to bring supporters of mr law back into the fold .
reacting to the interview , dai davies , spokesman for blaenau gwent 's people 's voice group which supported mr law , said that the apology was " hypocritical " and reflected labour 's desire for self-preservation .
mr davies , mr law 's former parliamentary agent and likely by-election candidate , added that the labour party could have done this " five , six , 10 months ago " .
he added that the apology reflected the party 's " desperation " to win the upcoming double by-election in the seat caused by mr law 's death last month .
party selection parties contesting the parliamentary and welsh assembly seats in blaenau gwent have begun the process of selecting their candidates .
john hopkins will be the labour candidate for the seat in the assembly by-election while the party is due to choose its parliamentary candidate on monday .
the liberal democrats have chosen amy kitcher to fight the parliamentary seat with abertillery councillor steve bard contesting the assembly seat .
the conservatives and plaid cymru are expected to confirm their candidates by the end of the week .
the blaenau gwent people 's voice group has also said it will put candidates forward .

mr davies , mr law 's former parliamentary agent and likely by-election candidate , added that the labour party could have done this " five , six , 10 months ago " .
he added that the apology reflected the party 's " desperation " to win the upcoming double by-election in the seat caused by mr law 's death last month .

in spite of the secrecy surrounding the ufo study , it seems citizens of planet earth have little to worry about .
the report , which was completed in 2000 and stamped " secret : uk eyes only " , has been made public for the first time .
only a small number of copies were produced and the identity of the man who wrote it has been protected .
his findings were only made public thanks to the freedom of information act , after a request by sheffield hallam university academic dr david clarke .
the four-year study - entitled unidentified aerial phenomena in the uk - tackles the long-running question by ufo-spotters : " is anyone out there ? "
the answer , it seems , is " no " .
have your say never in thirty years of working out of doors at all hours have i seen anything that can not be explained by a few seconds reasoned thought barry p , havant , uk send us your comments the 400-page report puts it like this : " no evidence exists to suggest that the phenomena seen are hostile or under any type of control , other than that of natural physical forces . "
it adds : " there is no evidence that ' solid ' objects exist which could cause a collision hazard . "
so if there are no such things as little green men in spaceships or flying saucers , why have so many people reported seeing them ?
well , here is the science bit .
" evidence suggests that meteors and their well-known effects and , possibly some other less-known effects are responsible for some unidentified aerial phenomena , " concludes the report .
meteors may have been responsible for some ufo sightings " considerable evidence exists to support the thesis that the events are almost certainly attributable to physical , electrical and magnetic phenomena in the atmosphere , mesosphere and ionosphere .
" they appear to originate due to more than one set of weather and electrically charged conditions , and are observed so infrequently as to make them unique to the majority of observers . "
people who claim to have had a " close encounter " are often difficult to persuade that they did not really see what they thought they saw .
the report offers a possible medical explanation .
" the close proximity of plasma related fields can adversely affect a vehicle or person , " states the report .
" local fields of this type have been medically proven to cause responses in the temporal lobes of the human brain .
these result in the observer sustaining -lrb- and later describing and retaining -rrb- his or her own vivid , but mainly incorrect , description of what is experienced . "
there are , of course , other causes of ufos - aeroplanes with particularly bright lights , stray odd-shaped balloons and strange flocks of birds , to name but a few .
the report admits its findings will not persuade everyone yet , it will be difficult to convince everyone that there is a rational explanation for all mysterious movements in the sky .
some ufo-spotters believe governments will always cover up the truth about ufos , because they are afraid of admitting that there is something beyond their control .
it is not clear how much time and effort the mod has spent looking at the skies in recent years , but it appears there are no plans for an in-depth ufo report like the one written in 2000 .
a mod spokesperson said : " both this study and the original " flying saucer working party " -lsb- already in public domain in the national archives -rsb- concluded that there is insufficient evidence to indicate the presence of any genuine unidentified aerial phenomena .
" it is unlikely that we would carry out any future studies unless such evidence were to emerge . "

have your say never in thirty years of working out of doors at all hours have i seen anything that can not be explained by a few seconds reasoned thought barry p , havant , uk send us your comments the 400-page report puts it like this : " no evidence exists to suggest that the phenomena seen are hostile or under any type of control , other than that of natural physical forces . "
it adds : " there is no evidence that ' solid ' objects exist which could cause a collision hazard . "
so if there are no such things as little green men in spaceships or flying saucers , why have so many people reported seeing them ?
well , here is the science bit .
" evidence suggests that meteors and their well-known effects and , possibly some other less-known effects are responsible for some unidentified aerial phenomena , " concludes the report .
meteors may have been responsible for some ufo sightings " considerable evidence exists to support the thesis that the events are almost certainly attributable to physical , electrical and magnetic phenomena in the atmosphere , mesosphere and ionosphere .
" they appear to originate due to more than one set of weather and electrically charged conditions , and are observed so infrequently as to make them unique to the majority of observers . "
people who claim to have had a " close encounter " are often difficult to persuade that they did not really see what they thought they saw .
the report offers a possible medical explanation .
" the close proximity of plasma related fields can adversely affect a vehicle or person , " states the report .
" local fields of this type have been medically proven to cause responses in the temporal lobes of the human brain .
these result in the observer sustaining -lrb- and later describing and retaining -rrb- his or her own vivid , but mainly incorrect , description of what is experienced . "
there are , of course , other causes of ufos - aeroplanes with particularly bright lights , stray odd-shaped balloons and strange flocks of birds , to name but a few .
the report admits its findings will not persuade everyone yet , it will be difficult to convince everyone that there is a rational explanation for all mysterious movements in the sky .
some ufo-spotters believe governments will always cover up the truth about ufos , because they are afraid of admitting that there is something beyond their control .
it is not clear how much time and effort the mod has spent looking at the skies in recent years , but it appears there are no plans for an in-depth ufo report like the one written in 2000 .
a mod spokesperson said : " both this study and the original " flying saucer working party " -lsb- already in public domain in the national archives -rsb- concluded that there is insufficient evidence to indicate the presence of any genuine unidentified aerial phenomena .
" it is unlikely that we would carry out any future studies unless such evidence were to emerge . "
