under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .

" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

it 's not naming names , but some suspect the country is sweden . citing a clear breach of the country 's human rights duties , the council of europe , the continent 's human rights watchdog , declined to name the country in question , but said the nation had secretly transferred suspects .
the body said it was up to national authorities or the european court of human rights to act . " we have received official acknowledgement of handing over ' individuals to foreign officials " in violation of the european convention on human rights , council general secretary terry davis said .
" i am now in position to say that we no longer need to speak about ' alleged ' cases of rendition , " he added , referring to the process in which prisoners are transferred to jails in third countries where they faced torture and other abuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis in november , davis imposed a three-month deadline on the council 's 46 member states to provide information relating to suspicions that the american cia has run a network of secret jails in europe for al qaeda suspects . the council decided not to name the state that had admitted to the wrongdoing , davis ' spokesman matjas gruden told reuters .
but " everything will be very transparent .
we will publish the responses " once the responses have been collated over the next two weeks . sweden guilty party ? some say the country in question might be sweden , where security services have come under criticism for the expulsion of two egyptian terrorism suspects who were then handed over to us agents and flown home aboard a us government-leased aircraft in 2001 .
the organization human rights watch has said there is credible evidence that the two were later tortured . while the swedish government has thus far declined to comment , opposition politician cecilia wilkstrom told reuters .
" i would put some money on sweden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air force c130 parked on a romanian airfield sarah ludford , a british liberal democratic member of the european parliament committee which is investigating cia prisons , agreed that sweden was a strong possibility . she added that that parliamentary committee was making headway in its own investigation .
it is expected to release an interim draft report next month . " we 'll say there is enough material to go on investigating and to keep up the pressure , " she told reuters . a washington post article last november first made the explosive accusations that the cia ran secret prisons in eastern europe for al qaeda suspects , but after several months the issue largely faded from view .
these new developments have put it in the headlines again . german investigation a german parliamentary inquiry will begin work on may 11 , examining the case of german citizen khaled al-masri , who was arrested at the end of 2003 and flown to afghanistan where he was held for months as a terrorist suspect by the us . al-masri was later released without charge and is now suing the former head of the cia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid al-masri the german committee is also expected to look into the use of german airports for dozens of unexplained cia flights . the us acknowledges it has used secret prison transfers , but denies that it " outsources torture .

" you 're lying ! " the man yelled , " that 's the biggest load of crap i 've ever heard . " his outburst was sparked by author peter pfütze 's assertion that all of the 550 west germans who were imprisoned by the stasi from the mid-1970s on had confessed to crimes the secret police accused them of .
" i spent nine years and eight months in prison and i never confessed , " the man continued . the two books , both written by former employees of the gdr secret police , aim to present the notorious organization as just another intelligence service , along the lines of the cia or west germany 's bnd , but which has been unfairly demonized in the wake of east germany 's collapse . questionable history one of the books , " der botschaftsflüchtling " -lrb- " the refugee from the embassy " -rrb- , by gotthold schramm , contains accounts from former stasi spies operating across the border in then west germany .
markus wolf , the east germans ' chief spy , contributed a foreword to schramm 's book . the book contains accounts of the experiences of 35 former stasi agents , which the publisher describes as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . " the other , entitled " besuchszeit " -lrb- " visiting hours " -rrb- and written by former stasi officer pfütze , insists that prisoners were treated well .
in the book , he describes visits west german diplomats were allowed to make to west germans imprisoned by the east german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former stasi prison hohenschönhausen in eastern berlin " the prisoners were treated correctly , " pfütze told the audience , some of whom then erupted into sarcastic laughter . the two authors presented the gdr as a country which respected the rule of law , which operated very normally within the framework of its own constitutional framework . " the gdr was recognized by 180 nations , " said schramm .
" tell me , were they all idiots ? " tense atmosphere but the atmosphere in the room was tense , and the two authors ' talks were often interrupted by catcalls , mostly from former prisoners or family members of those persecuted by the east german regime .
a man claiming to be a psychologist in the former east germany interrupted comments from schramm and claimed the stasi used " psychological methods of torture . " schramm rejected the man 's accusations that the stasi were " fascists , " saying : " we were not nazis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files have to be painstakingly reconstructed in many cases the books ' release comes in the wake of another high-profile instance of former stasi member publicly defending their actions under the former communist regime .
in march , some 200 former officers disrupted a meeting at the hohenschönhausen site , a former stasi prison in berlin and now a museum and memorial . the officers called many of the former victims of the secret service " liars " when they described the terror , abuse and suffering they experienced at the prison . marianne birthler , head of the authority which researches stasi records , called this new public resurfacing of former stasi officers alarming . " they are spreading aggressive propaganda , organized themselves and disturbing gatherings , " she warned . the stasi compiled surveillance files on approximately 6,000,000 east german citizens - more than one-third of the population . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film takes uncompromising look at gdr police state a debut film by a young german director about east germany 's secret police has critics raving and awards piling up .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .

" you 're lying ! " the man yelled , " that 's the biggest load of crap i 've ever heard . " his outburst was sparked by author peter pfütze 's assertion that all of the 550 west germans who were imprisoned by the stasi from the mid-1970s on had confessed to crimes the secret police accused them of .
" i spent nine years and eight months in prison and i never confessed , " the man continued . the two books , both written by former employees of the gdr secret police , aim to present the notorious organization as just another intelligence service , along the lines of the cia or west germany 's bnd , but which has been unfairly demonized in the wake of east germany 's collapse . questionable history one of the books , " der botschaftsflüchtling " -lrb- " the refugee from the embassy " -rrb- , by gotthold schramm , contains accounts from former stasi spies operating across the border in then west germany .
markus wolf , the east germans ' chief spy , contributed a foreword to schramm 's book . the book contains accounts of the experiences of 35 former stasi agents , which the publisher describes as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . " the other , entitled " besuchszeit " -lrb- " visiting hours " -rrb- and written by former stasi officer pfütze , insists that prisoners were treated well .
in the book , he describes visits west german diplomats were allowed to make to west germans imprisoned by the east german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former stasi prison hohenschönhausen in eastern berlin " the prisoners were treated correctly , " pfütze told the audience , some of whom then erupted into sarcastic laughter . the two authors presented the gdr as a country which respected the rule of law , which operated very normally within the framework of its own constitutional framework . " the gdr was recognized by 180 nations , " said schramm .
" tell me , were they all idiots ? " tense atmosphere but the atmosphere in the room was tense , and the two authors ' talks were often interrupted by catcalls , mostly from former prisoners or family members of those persecuted by the east german regime .
a man claiming to be a psychologist in the former east germany interrupted comments from schramm and claimed the stasi used " psychological methods of torture . " schramm rejected the man 's accusations that the stasi were " fascists , " saying : " we were not nazis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files have to be painstakingly reconstructed in many cases the books ' release comes in the wake of another high-profile instance of former stasi member publicly defending their actions under the former communist regime .
in march , some 200 former officers disrupted a meeting at the hohenschönhausen site , a former stasi prison in berlin and now a museum and memorial . the officers called many of the former victims of the secret service " liars " when they described the terror , abuse and suffering they experienced at the prison . marianne birthler , head of the authority which researches stasi records , called this new public resurfacing of former stasi officers alarming .

quite a lot , according to poland . the polish government wants unesco to clearly describe the former auschwitz death camp as " nazi " and " german " in the un culture organization 's list of world heritage sites .
they say it shopuld be officially designated as the " former nazi german auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . " at the moment the un culture organization lists the site as the " auschwitz concentration camp , " but says in its accompanying description that the " fortified walls , barbed wire , platforms , barracks , gallows , gas chambers and cremation ovens show the conditions within which the nazi genocide took place in the former concentration and extermination camp of auschwitz-birkenau , the largest in the third reich . " " we can not continue to ignore repeated publications that defame poland , " jan kasprzyk , a culture ministry official told reuters .
" the new name is completely accurate .

germany has appealed to the iranian government to stop its uranium enrichment program . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad on thursday shunned international demands to freeze his country 's controversial nuclear drive , as the head of the united nations atomic agency , mohamed elbaradei , flew into tehran in a bid to head off an escalation of the crisis . " the situation is completely changed .
we are a nuclear state , " hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad said in the wake of a breakthrough in the country 's disputed nuclear energy drive , seen in the west as a mask for weapons development . iran announced this week that its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is peaceful , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead .
the un security council has set april 28 as a deadline for tehran to halt enrichment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is adamant about iran 's nuclear ambitions " we will not negotiate on our rights with anyone , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by the official news agency irna .
he added that nobody in the country " has the right to step back one iota from the path we are following . " elbaradei tries to negotiate international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei arrived in tehran during the night for talks with the regime 's top nuclear negotiator and a message that appeared to be falling on deaf ears . " we hope to convince iran to take confidence-building measures including suspension of uranium enrichment activities until outstanding issues are clarified , " elbaradei told journalists at the airport . " i would like to see iran has come to terms with the request of the international community , " adding that he still remained " hopeful the time is right for political solutions , through negotiations . " elbaradei must give a report at the end of april on iran 's nuclear activities to the un security council and the 35 states of the iaea 's governing council . world powers consider stronger action toward iran representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with the long-running stand-off set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier us secretary of state condoleezza rice called for the 15-member security council to take " strong steps " and the white house said sanctions were now an option . officials from permanent security council members britain , france and russia , as well as german officials , all said iran had taken a " step in the wrong direction . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told german broadcaster ard that suspicions about iran 's nuclear ambitions were triggered by tehran 's years-long , clandestine nuclear research .
he said iran 's statements about its progress in atomic technology were a " renewed provocation that must not only be rejected , but which have also reinforced -lrb- international -rrb- concerns . " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , however , was quoted as strongly opposing the use of force after us reports over the weekend suggested washington was considering military action - even a possible nuclear strike . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans and french criticize iran nuclear claim germany and france said wednesday iran 's claim to have enriched uranium on its own was a step in the wrong direction .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .

rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .

by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .

the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .

by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .
we have germans , togolese , other africans , even turkish members . " small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .
but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved . " togo 's new cultural ambassadors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing strong for togo : aziabou and klein with regional coordinator ali tchassanti the fan club has big plans for the games .
their web site supports togolese who want to attend the games with information and accommodations .
they also plan to set up an intercultural café in berlin , organize dancing and music for togolese fans during the preliminary matches , and get a team togo together for a fan soccer tournament .
but all ideas are still waiting for sponsors to make them happen .
if nothing else , the first yellow and green fan shirts are already made . " we want to fans to cheer on the togolese national team , " klein said .

" you 're lying ! " the man yelled , " that 's the biggest load of crap i 've ever heard . " his outburst was sparked by author peter pfütze 's assertion that all of the 550 west germans who were imprisoned by the stasi from the mid-1970s on had confessed to crimes the secret police accused them of .
" i spent nine years and eight months in prison and i never confessed , " the man continued . the two books , both written by former employees of the gdr secret police , aim to present the notorious organization as just another intelligence service , along the lines of the cia or west germany 's bnd , but which has been unfairly demonized in the wake of east germany 's collapse . questionable history one of the books , " der botschaftsflüchtling " -lrb- " the refugee from the embassy " -rrb- , by gotthold schramm , contains accounts from former stasi spies operating across the border in then west germany .
markus wolf , the east germans ' chief spy , contributed a foreword to schramm 's book . the book contains accounts of the experiences of 35 former stasi agents , which the publisher describes as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . " the other , entitled " besuchszeit " -lrb- " visiting hours " -rrb- and written by former stasi officer pfütze , insists that prisoners were treated well .
in the book , he describes visits west german diplomats were allowed to make to west germans imprisoned by the east german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former stasi prison hohenschönhausen in eastern berlin " the prisoners were treated correctly , " pfütze told the audience , some of whom then erupted into sarcastic laughter . the two authors presented the gdr as a country which respected the rule of law , which operated very normally within the framework of its own constitutional framework . " the gdr was recognized by 180 nations , " said schramm .
" tell me , were they all idiots ? " tense atmosphere but the atmosphere in the room was tense , and the two authors ' talks were often interrupted by catcalls , mostly from former prisoners or family members of those persecuted by the east german regime .
a man claiming to be a psychologist in the former east germany interrupted comments from schramm and claimed the stasi used " psychological methods of torture . " schramm rejected the man 's accusations that the stasi were " fascists , " saying : " we were not nazis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files have to be painstakingly reconstructed in many cases the books ' release comes in the wake of another high-profile instance of former stasi member publicly defending their actions under the former communist regime .
in march , some 200 former officers disrupted a meeting at the hohenschönhausen site , a former stasi prison in berlin and now a museum and memorial . the officers called many of the former victims of the secret service " liars " when they described the terror , abuse and suffering they experienced at the prison . marianne birthler , head of the authority which researches stasi records , called this new public resurfacing of former stasi officers alarming . " they are spreading aggressive propaganda , organized themselves and disturbing gatherings , " she warned . the stasi compiled surveillance files on approximately 6,000,000 east german citizens - more than one-third of the population . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film takes uncompromising look at gdr police state a debut film by a young german director about east germany 's secret police has critics raving and awards piling up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2006 poland wants name change for auschwitz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants the world to remember that auschwitz was german not polish poland has stirred controversy by requesting that unesco change the name of auschwitz concentration camp to better reflect its nazi german - not polish - origin . it began after a german magazine referred to auschwitz concentration camp as a " polish " death camp . what is in a name ?
quite a lot , according to poland . the polish government wants unesco to clearly describe the former auschwitz death camp as " nazi " and " german " in the un culture organization 's list of world heritage sites .
they say it shopuld be officially designated as the " former nazi german auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . " at the moment the un culture organization lists the site as the " auschwitz concentration camp , " but says in its accompanying description that the " fortified walls , barbed wire , platforms , barracks , gallows , gas chambers and cremation ovens show the conditions within which the nazi genocide took place in the former concentration and extermination camp of auschwitz-birkenau , the largest in the third reich . " " we can not continue to ignore repeated publications that defame poland , " jan kasprzyk , a culture ministry official told reuters .
" the new name is completely accurate .
by stating who was the perpetrator of a war that ended more than 60 years ago , honest mistakes could be avoided . " more than a million died germany occupied poland from 1939 to 1945 .
in 1940 , the nazis built the camp on the site of former polish army barracks on the outskirts of the southern town of oswiecim - auschwitz in german .
it was one of six extermination camps in poland . bildunterschrift : more than 1 million people died in auschwitz , mostly jewish the camp was expanded later to the nearby village of birkenau .
at least 1.1 million men , women and children , mostly jews , perished at auschwitz-birkenau during world war ii . the auschwitz concentration camp was included in the unesco world heritage list in 1979 .
since then , international media have repeatedly referred to the camp as polish due to its location .
polish officials have long complained to journalists to no avail , they said . redefining history ? the world jewish congress has voiced opposition to the polish request , saying that the country wants to redefine history with the name change . " although the camp had been built and run by nazi germany , everybody in the area had known about its existence and workers were recruited from the polish population in the neighboring village , " wjc officials told german news agency dpa in a statement . but wladyslaw bartoszewski , the head of the international auschwitz council and a former camp prisoner disagreed , telling the news agency that " none of the local residents worked at auschwitz . " controversial timing the issue has attracted attention just one month before a visit by german-born pope benedict xvi to auschwitz in his first journey to his predecessor 's homeland since assuming the his position .
it also follows a stern warning from the vatican to poland 's hard-line catholic radio maryja after the fundamentalist radio station - which claims to have an audience of around three million - aired anti-semitic statements by commentator stanislaw michalkiewicz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has reached out to jews in his first year as pope michalkiewicz accused jews of " humiliating poland internationally by demanding money " for goods and property expropriated during world war ii . " we look after democratic issues in ukraine and belarus , while in our own backyard , ' kikes ' sneak up behind us to try to oblige our government to pay them money on the pretext of these demands , " he said . some conservatives say the vatican issued the warnings because the pope is german . in a comment broadcast on radio maryja and published in its sister publication , nasz dziennik , boguslaw wolniewicz , an academic , said : " i have a sneaking suspicion that those who were behind the latest attack -lrb- on radio maryja -rrb- are trying to exploit the fact that the new pope is german and would be ill-placed to defend someone whom the media and some in his entourage have accused of anti-semitism .
no one on earth is more scared of being labeled an anti-semite than a german .
and with good reason , because they know what they did . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

quite a lot , according to poland . the polish government wants unesco to clearly describe the former auschwitz death camp as " nazi " and " german " in the un culture organization 's list of world heritage sites .
they say it shopuld be officially designated as the " former nazi german auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . " at the moment the un culture organization lists the site as the " auschwitz concentration camp , " but says in its accompanying description that the " fortified walls , barbed wire , platforms , barracks , gallows , gas chambers and cremation ovens show the conditions within which the nazi genocide took place in the former concentration and extermination camp of auschwitz-birkenau , the largest in the third reich . " " we can not continue to ignore repeated publications that defame poland , " jan kasprzyk , a culture ministry official told reuters .
" the new name is completely accurate .
by stating who was the perpetrator of a war that ended more than 60 years ago , honest mistakes could be avoided . " more than a million died germany occupied poland from 1939 to 1945 .
in 1940 , the nazis built the camp on the site of former polish army barracks on the outskirts of the southern town of oswiecim - auschwitz in german .
it was one of six extermination camps in poland . bildunterschrift : more than 1 million people died in auschwitz , mostly jewish the camp was expanded later to the nearby village of birkenau .
at least 1.1 million men , women and children , mostly jews , perished at auschwitz-birkenau during world war ii . the auschwitz concentration camp was included in the unesco world heritage list in 1979 .
since then , international media have repeatedly referred to the camp as polish due to its location .
polish officials have long complained to journalists to no avail , they said . redefining history ? the world jewish congress has voiced opposition to the polish request , saying that the country wants to redefine history with the name change . " although the camp had been built and run by nazi germany , everybody in the area had known about its existence and workers were recruited from the polish population in the neighboring village , " wjc officials told german news agency dpa in a statement . but wladyslaw bartoszewski , the head of the international auschwitz council and a former camp prisoner disagreed , telling the news agency that " none of the local residents worked at auschwitz . " controversial timing the issue has attracted attention just one month before a visit by german-born pope benedict xvi to auschwitz in his first journey to his predecessor 's homeland since assuming the his position .
it also follows a stern warning from the vatican to poland 's hard-line catholic radio maryja after the fundamentalist radio station - which claims to have an audience of around three million - aired anti-semitic statements by commentator stanislaw michalkiewicz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has reached out to jews in his first year as pope michalkiewicz accused jews of " humiliating poland internationally by demanding money " for goods and property expropriated during world war ii . " we look after democratic issues in ukraine and belarus , while in our own backyard , ' kikes ' sneak up behind us to try to oblige our government to pay them money on the pretext of these demands , " he said . some conservatives say the vatican issued the warnings because the pope is german . in a comment broadcast on radio maryja and published in its sister publication , nasz dziennik , boguslaw wolniewicz , an academic , said : " i have a sneaking suspicion that those who were behind the latest attack -lrb- on radio maryja -rrb- are trying to exploit the fact that the new pope is german and would be ill-placed to defend someone whom the media and some in his entourage have accused of anti-semitism .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .

for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2006 poland wants name change for auschwitz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants the world to remember that auschwitz was german not polish poland has stirred controversy by requesting that unesco change the name of auschwitz concentration camp to better reflect its nazi german - not polish - origin . it began after a german magazine referred to auschwitz concentration camp as a " polish " death camp . what is in a name ?
quite a lot , according to poland . the polish government wants unesco to clearly describe the former auschwitz death camp as " nazi " and " german " in the un culture organization 's list of world heritage sites .
they say it shopuld be officially designated as the " former nazi german auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . " at the moment the un culture organization lists the site as the " auschwitz concentration camp , " but says in its accompanying description that the " fortified walls , barbed wire , platforms , barracks , gallows , gas chambers and cremation ovens show the conditions within which the nazi genocide took place in the former concentration and extermination camp of auschwitz-birkenau , the largest in the third reich . " " we can not continue to ignore repeated publications that defame poland , " jan kasprzyk , a culture ministry official told reuters .
" the new name is completely accurate .
by stating who was the perpetrator of a war that ended more than 60 years ago , honest mistakes could be avoided . " more than a million died germany occupied poland from 1939 to 1945 .
in 1940 , the nazis built the camp on the site of former polish army barracks on the outskirts of the southern town of oswiecim - auschwitz in german .
it was one of six extermination camps in poland . bildunterschrift : more than 1 million people died in auschwitz , mostly jewish the camp was expanded later to the nearby village of birkenau .
at least 1.1 million men , women and children , mostly jews , perished at auschwitz-birkenau during world war ii . the auschwitz concentration camp was included in the unesco world heritage list in 1979 .
since then , international media have repeatedly referred to the camp as polish due to its location .
polish officials have long complained to journalists to no avail , they said . redefining history ? the world jewish congress has voiced opposition to the polish request , saying that the country wants to redefine history with the name change . " although the camp had been built and run by nazi germany , everybody in the area had known about its existence and workers were recruited from the polish population in the neighboring village , " wjc officials told german news agency dpa in a statement . but wladyslaw bartoszewski , the head of the international auschwitz council and a former camp prisoner disagreed , telling the news agency that " none of the local residents worked at auschwitz . " controversial timing the issue has attracted attention just one month before a visit by german-born pope benedict xvi to auschwitz in his first journey to his predecessor 's homeland since assuming the his position .
it also follows a stern warning from the vatican to poland 's hard-line catholic radio maryja after the fundamentalist radio station - which claims to have an audience of around three million - aired anti-semitic statements by commentator stanislaw michalkiewicz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has reached out to jews in his first year as pope michalkiewicz accused jews of " humiliating poland internationally by demanding money " for goods and property expropriated during world war ii . " we look after democratic issues in ukraine and belarus , while in our own backyard , ' kikes ' sneak up behind us to try to oblige our government to pay them money on the pretext of these demands , " he said . some conservatives say the vatican issued the warnings because the pope is german . in a comment broadcast on radio maryja and published in its sister publication , nasz dziennik , boguslaw wolniewicz , an academic , said : " i have a sneaking suspicion that those who were behind the latest attack -lrb- on radio maryja -rrb- are trying to exploit the fact that the new pope is german and would be ill-placed to defend someone whom the media and some in his entourage have accused of anti-semitism .
no one on earth is more scared of being labeled an anti-semite than a german .
and with good reason , because they know what they did . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.04.2006 amo , amas , amat : german students ' love affair with latin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genitive , vocative , ablative - a lot of german students are n't intimidated by latin grammar while many students consider latin a grammatical nightmare of declensions , cases and genders which must be painfully memorized , the tongue of julius caesar , cicero et al. is a popular subject in german schools . at german schools , latin is currently the third most popular foreign language among secondary school students and it 's gaining in popularity .
the status of the language of the ancient romans and mother of several modern european tongues is even greater than that of world tongue spanish .
italian , a child of latin , ca n't hold a candle to its parent as far as numbers of students go . in 2003 , 654,000 german students between the ages of 14-18 were busy declining a -stem nouns and conjugating i -stem verbs .
two years later , that number increased more than 13 percent to 740,000 .
only english , with 10 times the number of learners , and french , two-and-a-half times as popular , beat latin in the foreign language race . returning to europe 's roots the popularity of latin in germany coincides with a unification of europe .
it is a phenomenon somewhat similar to the era when augustus caesar 's empire stretched from gaul in the northwest to asia minor in the southeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius caesar , emperor of rome and conqueror of much of europe latin was the lingua franca then , and rome , together with its role model greece , was the cradle of modern european civilization .
it 's exactly this attempt to understand one 's roots and find a common european identity that is driving latin 's current renewal , according to hartmut loos , chair of the german philology association . students who read ovid , for example , experience the mythology that has left its mark on western culture and discover how europe got its name through the abduction of europa by the roman god jupiter .
possibly trivial , but nomen est omen , particularly in the age of globalization . " no subject is better suited than latin to help us understand our common european roots , " loos said .
" it is the mother of european languages , and allows students clear insight into europe 's cultural tradition .
latin is a multifaceted instrument that imparts language , methodical , cultural , and personal skills . " better teaching methods , more interested students while many who took latin in the past have not-so-fond memories of late-night memorizing of verb tables and conjugation patterns , current latin learners have a largely different experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum tour in bremen - in latin , of course today 's students are spared the tedious task of parsing and translating each and every word .
what 's important is not the rote learning of dative and ablative forms , but the ability to analyze the content of julius caesar 's gallic wars , or illustrate how cicero 's republic is relevant to modern democracy . also , pupils today are left more often to their own resources .
they work together in groups and present their findings to their classmates , instead of just responding to teacher 's questions .
in the words of one of germany 's leading educators , friedrich maier , latin instruction is meant to build character and not to be just a grammar drill . textbook editors have also dramatically altered the content of teaching materials by adding more information about roman culture , politics , philosophy and daily life . milosevic mortuus latin is not , however , simply popular with teenagers .
one of the biggest advocates of antiquity and the classical languages in the classroom is the country 's most popular quiz show host , günter jauch . the 49-year-old who asks the questions for the german version of who wants to be a millionaire ? admits that latin and greek are difficult .
but he compares learning classic languages to taking a trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter jauch , popular quiz show host and promoter of the classics " latin is like taking the long way , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" if i want to get from a to b fastest , then i 'll drive on the autobahn .
the beauty in travel though is the stops in between , or traveling through the villages . " many latin teachers enjoy their work also and try to bring the " dead " language to vibrant life .
seven schoolteachers in the northern city of bremen compile and broadcast a radio bulletin in latin with the month 's top local , national and international news stories from around the world .
in march , the demise of a former leader in the balkans was the lead item : milosevic mortuus . quidquid latine dictum sit , altum viditur .
translation : " anything said in latin sounds profound . " john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany leads latin revival just when you thought that " dumbing down " had got the better of everyone , it seems that germany has rediscovered the joys of latin .

10 , 2006 -rrb- new campaign seeks to calm germans ' anglomania the use of foreign words in german is nothing new , but more and more anglicisms are creeping in , upsetting some language mavens .

the status of the language of the ancient romans and mother of several modern european tongues is even greater than that of world tongue spanish .
italian , a child of latin , ca n't hold a candle to its parent as far as numbers of students go . in 2003 , 654,000 german students between the ages of 14-18 were busy declining a -stem nouns and conjugating i -stem verbs .
two years later , that number increased more than 13 percent to 740,000 .
only english , with 10 times the number of learners , and french , two-and-a-half times as popular , beat latin in the foreign language race . returning to europe 's roots the popularity of latin in germany coincides with a unification of europe .
it is a phenomenon somewhat similar to the era when augustus caesar 's empire stretched from gaul in the northwest to asia minor in the southeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius caesar , emperor of rome and conqueror of much of europe latin was the lingua franca then , and rome , together with its role model greece , was the cradle of modern european civilization .
it 's exactly this attempt to understand one 's roots and find a common european identity that is driving latin 's current renewal , according to hartmut loos , chair of the german philology association . students who read ovid , for example , experience the mythology that has left its mark on western culture and discover how europe got its name through the abduction of europa by the roman god jupiter .
possibly trivial , but nomen est omen , particularly in the age of globalization . " no subject is better suited than latin to help us understand our common european roots , " loos said .
" it is the mother of european languages , and allows students clear insight into europe 's cultural tradition .
latin is a multifaceted instrument that imparts language , methodical , cultural , and personal skills . " better teaching methods , more interested students while many who took latin in the past have not-so-fond memories of late-night memorizing of verb tables and conjugation patterns , current latin learners have a largely different experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum tour in bremen - in latin , of course today 's students are spared the tedious task of parsing and translating each and every word .
what 's important is not the rote learning of dative and ablative forms , but the ability to analyze the content of julius caesar 's gallic wars , or illustrate how cicero 's republic is relevant to modern democracy . also , pupils today are left more often to their own resources .
they work together in groups and present their findings to their classmates , instead of just responding to teacher 's questions .
in the words of one of germany 's leading educators , friedrich maier , latin instruction is meant to build character and not to be just a grammar drill . textbook editors have also dramatically altered the content of teaching materials by adding more information about roman culture , politics , philosophy and daily life . milosevic mortuus latin is not , however , simply popular with teenagers .
one of the biggest advocates of antiquity and the classical languages in the classroom is the country 's most popular quiz show host , günter jauch . the 49-year-old who asks the questions for the german version of who wants to be a millionaire ? admits that latin and greek are difficult .
but he compares learning classic languages to taking a trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter jauch , popular quiz show host and promoter of the classics " latin is like taking the long way , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" if i want to get from a to b fastest , then i 'll drive on the autobahn .
the beauty in travel though is the stops in between , or traveling through the villages . " many latin teachers enjoy their work also and try to bring the " dead " language to vibrant life .
seven schoolteachers in the northern city of bremen compile and broadcast a radio bulletin in latin with the month 's top local , national and international news stories from around the world .
in march , the demise of a former leader in the balkans was the lead item : milosevic mortuus . quidquid latine dictum sit , altum viditur .
translation : " anything said in latin sounds profound . " john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows .

but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .
we have germans , togolese , other africans , even turkish members . " small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .
but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved . " togo 's new cultural ambassadors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing strong for togo : aziabou and klein with regional coordinator ali tchassanti the fan club has big plans for the games .
their web site supports togolese who want to attend the games with information and accommodations .
they also plan to set up an intercultural café in berlin , organize dancing and music for togolese fans during the preliminary matches , and get a team togo together for a fan soccer tournament .
but all ideas are still waiting for sponsors to make them happen .
if nothing else , the first yellow and green fan shirts are already made . " we want to fans to cheer on the togolese national team , " klein said .
" but we also want awake interest in togo in general .
we will keep the club going , even after the games are over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .

however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .

" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

quite a lot , according to poland . the polish government wants unesco to clearly describe the former auschwitz death camp as " nazi " and " german " in the un culture organization 's list of world heritage sites .
they say it shopuld be officially designated as the " former nazi german auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . " at the moment the un culture organization lists the site as the " auschwitz concentration camp , " but says in its accompanying description that the " fortified walls , barbed wire , platforms , barracks , gallows , gas chambers and cremation ovens show the conditions within which the nazi genocide took place in the former concentration and extermination camp of auschwitz-birkenau , the largest in the third reich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.04.2006 amo , amas , amat : german students ' love affair with latin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genitive , vocative , ablative - a lot of german students are n't intimidated by latin grammar while many students consider latin a grammatical nightmare of declensions , cases and genders which must be painfully memorized , the tongue of julius caesar , cicero et al. is a popular subject in german schools . at german schools , latin is currently the third most popular foreign language among secondary school students and it 's gaining in popularity .
the status of the language of the ancient romans and mother of several modern european tongues is even greater than that of world tongue spanish .
italian , a child of latin , ca n't hold a candle to its parent as far as numbers of students go . in 2003 , 654,000 german students between the ages of 14-18 were busy declining a -stem nouns and conjugating i -stem verbs .
two years later , that number increased more than 13 percent to 740,000 .
only english , with 10 times the number of learners , and french , two-and-a-half times as popular , beat latin in the foreign language race . returning to europe 's roots the popularity of latin in germany coincides with a unification of europe .
it is a phenomenon somewhat similar to the era when augustus caesar 's empire stretched from gaul in the northwest to asia minor in the southeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius caesar , emperor of rome and conqueror of much of europe latin was the lingua franca then , and rome , together with its role model greece , was the cradle of modern european civilization .
it 's exactly this attempt to understand one 's roots and find a common european identity that is driving latin 's current renewal , according to hartmut loos , chair of the german philology association . students who read ovid , for example , experience the mythology that has left its mark on western culture and discover how europe got its name through the abduction of europa by the roman god jupiter .
possibly trivial , but nomen est omen , particularly in the age of globalization . " no subject is better suited than latin to help us understand our common european roots , " loos said .
" it is the mother of european languages , and allows students clear insight into europe 's cultural tradition .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .
but their admission fees of four euros -lrb- $ 4.83 -rrb- do not nearly cover the maintenance costs .
the foundation lives from the sale and reproduction royalties from nolde 's works .
however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .
beginning in april , a new " nolde shuttle bus " will also bring visitors from the island of sylt , looking for a break from overcrowded beaches and sunburn , directly to the museum 's door . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating the roots of expressionism 100 years have passed since the founding of the influential art group , " die brücke " or " the bridge .

but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .

" you 're lying ! " the man yelled , " that 's the biggest load of crap i 've ever heard . " his outburst was sparked by author peter pfütze 's assertion that all of the 550 west germans who were imprisoned by the stasi from the mid-1970s on had confessed to crimes the secret police accused them of .
" i spent nine years and eight months in prison and i never confessed , " the man continued . the two books , both written by former employees of the gdr secret police , aim to present the notorious organization as just another intelligence service , along the lines of the cia or west germany 's bnd , but which has been unfairly demonized in the wake of east germany 's collapse . questionable history one of the books , " der botschaftsflüchtling " -lrb- " the refugee from the embassy " -rrb- , by gotthold schramm , contains accounts from former stasi spies operating across the border in then west germany .
markus wolf , the east germans ' chief spy , contributed a foreword to schramm 's book . the book contains accounts of the experiences of 35 former stasi agents , which the publisher describes as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . " the other , entitled " besuchszeit " -lrb- " visiting hours " -rrb- and written by former stasi officer pfütze , insists that prisoners were treated well .
in the book , he describes visits west german diplomats were allowed to make to west germans imprisoned by the east german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former stasi prison hohenschönhausen in eastern berlin " the prisoners were treated correctly , " pfütze told the audience , some of whom then erupted into sarcastic laughter . the two authors presented the gdr as a country which respected the rule of law , which operated very normally within the framework of its own constitutional framework . " the gdr was recognized by 180 nations , " said schramm .
" tell me , were they all idiots ? " tense atmosphere but the atmosphere in the room was tense , and the two authors ' talks were often interrupted by catcalls , mostly from former prisoners or family members of those persecuted by the east german regime .
a man claiming to be a psychologist in the former east germany interrupted comments from schramm and claimed the stasi used " psychological methods of torture . " schramm rejected the man 's accusations that the stasi were " fascists , " saying : " we were not nazis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files have to be painstakingly reconstructed in many cases the books ' release comes in the wake of another high-profile instance of former stasi member publicly defending their actions under the former communist regime .
in march , some 200 former officers disrupted a meeting at the hohenschönhausen site , a former stasi prison in berlin and now a museum and memorial . the officers called many of the former victims of the secret service " liars " when they described the terror , abuse and suffering they experienced at the prison . marianne birthler , head of the authority which researches stasi records , called this new public resurfacing of former stasi officers alarming . " they are spreading aggressive propaganda , organized themselves and disturbing gatherings , " she warned . the stasi compiled surveillance files on approximately 6,000,000 east german citizens - more than one-third of the population . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film takes uncompromising look at gdr police state a debut film by a young german director about east germany 's secret police has critics raving and awards piling up .
the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era .
-lrb- march 27 , 2006 -rrb- long shadow of stasi still darkens aspects of german life despite being disbanded 16 years ago , the legacy of the east german secret police - the stasi - continues to taint people in the public eye .

" you 're lying ! " the man yelled , " that 's the biggest load of crap i 've ever heard . " his outburst was sparked by author peter pfütze 's assertion that all of the 550 west germans who were imprisoned by the stasi from the mid-1970s on had confessed to crimes the secret police accused them of .
" i spent nine years and eight months in prison and i never confessed , " the man continued . the two books , both written by former employees of the gdr secret police , aim to present the notorious organization as just another intelligence service , along the lines of the cia or west germany 's bnd , but which has been unfairly demonized in the wake of east germany 's collapse . questionable history one of the books , " der botschaftsflüchtling " -lrb- " the refugee from the embassy " -rrb- , by gotthold schramm , contains accounts from former stasi spies operating across the border in then west germany .
markus wolf , the east germans ' chief spy , contributed a foreword to schramm 's book . the book contains accounts of the experiences of 35 former stasi agents , which the publisher describes as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . " the other , entitled " besuchszeit " -lrb- " visiting hours " -rrb- and written by former stasi officer pfütze , insists that prisoners were treated well .
in the book , he describes visits west german diplomats were allowed to make to west germans imprisoned by the east german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former stasi prison hohenschönhausen in eastern berlin " the prisoners were treated correctly , " pfütze told the audience , some of whom then erupted into sarcastic laughter . the two authors presented the gdr as a country which respected the rule of law , which operated very normally within the framework of its own constitutional framework . " the gdr was recognized by 180 nations , " said schramm .
" tell me , were they all idiots ? " tense atmosphere but the atmosphere in the room was tense , and the two authors ' talks were often interrupted by catcalls , mostly from former prisoners or family members of those persecuted by the east german regime .
a man claiming to be a psychologist in the former east germany interrupted comments from schramm and claimed the stasi used " psychological methods of torture . " schramm rejected the man 's accusations that the stasi were " fascists , " saying : " we were not nazis .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .
we have germans , togolese , other africans , even turkish members . " small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .
we have germans , togolese , other africans , even turkish members . " small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .
but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved . " togo 's new cultural ambassadors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing strong for togo : aziabou and klein with regional coordinator ali tchassanti the fan club has big plans for the games .

they also plan to set up an intercultural café in berlin , organize dancing and music for togolese fans during the preliminary matches , and get a team togo together for a fan soccer tournament .
but all ideas are still waiting for sponsors to make them happen .
if nothing else , the first yellow and green fan shirts are already made . " we want to fans to cheer on the togolese national team , " klein said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .

whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .

" totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .

but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved .

germany has appealed to the iranian government to stop its uranium enrichment program . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad on thursday shunned international demands to freeze his country 's controversial nuclear drive , as the head of the united nations atomic agency , mohamed elbaradei , flew into tehran in a bid to head off an escalation of the crisis . " the situation is completely changed .
we are a nuclear state , " hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad said in the wake of a breakthrough in the country 's disputed nuclear energy drive , seen in the west as a mask for weapons development . iran announced this week that its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is peaceful , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead .
the un security council has set april 28 as a deadline for tehran to halt enrichment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is adamant about iran 's nuclear ambitions " we will not negotiate on our rights with anyone , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by the official news agency irna .
he added that nobody in the country " has the right to step back one iota from the path we are following . " elbaradei tries to negotiate international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei arrived in tehran during the night for talks with the regime 's top nuclear negotiator and a message that appeared to be falling on deaf ears . " we hope to convince iran to take confidence-building measures including suspension of uranium enrichment activities until outstanding issues are clarified , " elbaradei told journalists at the airport . " i would like to see iran has come to terms with the request of the international community , " adding that he still remained " hopeful the time is right for political solutions , through negotiations . " elbaradei must give a report at the end of april on iran 's nuclear activities to the un security council and the 35 states of the iaea 's governing council . world powers consider stronger action toward iran representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with the long-running stand-off set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier us secretary of state condoleezza rice called for the 15-member security council to take " strong steps " and the white house said sanctions were now an option . officials from permanent security council members britain , france and russia , as well as german officials , all said iran had taken a " step in the wrong direction . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told german broadcaster ard that suspicions about iran 's nuclear ambitions were triggered by tehran 's years-long , clandestine nuclear research .
he said iran 's statements about its progress in atomic technology were a " renewed provocation that must not only be rejected , but which have also reinforced -lrb- international -rrb- concerns . " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , however , was quoted as strongly opposing the use of force after us reports over the weekend suggested washington was considering military action - even a possible nuclear strike . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans and french criticize iran nuclear claim germany and france said wednesday iran 's claim to have enriched uranium on its own was a step in the wrong direction .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .

germany has appealed to the iranian government to stop its uranium enrichment program . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad on thursday shunned international demands to freeze his country 's controversial nuclear drive , as the head of the united nations atomic agency , mohamed elbaradei , flew into tehran in a bid to head off an escalation of the crisis . " the situation is completely changed .
we are a nuclear state , " hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad said in the wake of a breakthrough in the country 's disputed nuclear energy drive , seen in the west as a mask for weapons development . iran announced this week that its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is peaceful , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead .
the un security council has set april 28 as a deadline for tehran to halt enrichment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is adamant about iran 's nuclear ambitions " we will not negotiate on our rights with anyone , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by the official news agency irna .
he added that nobody in the country " has the right to step back one iota from the path we are following . " elbaradei tries to negotiate international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei arrived in tehran during the night for talks with the regime 's top nuclear negotiator and a message that appeared to be falling on deaf ears . " we hope to convince iran to take confidence-building measures including suspension of uranium enrichment activities until outstanding issues are clarified , " elbaradei told journalists at the airport . " i would like to see iran has come to terms with the request of the international community , " adding that he still remained " hopeful the time is right for political solutions , through negotiations .

the status of the language of the ancient romans and mother of several modern european tongues is even greater than that of world tongue spanish .
italian , a child of latin , ca n't hold a candle to its parent as far as numbers of students go . in 2003 , 654,000 german students between the ages of 14-18 were busy declining a -stem nouns and conjugating i -stem verbs .
two years later , that number increased more than 13 percent to 740,000 .
only english , with 10 times the number of learners , and french , two-and-a-half times as popular , beat latin in the foreign language race . returning to europe 's roots the popularity of latin in germany coincides with a unification of europe .
it is a phenomenon somewhat similar to the era when augustus caesar 's empire stretched from gaul in the northwest to asia minor in the southeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius caesar , emperor of rome and conqueror of much of europe latin was the lingua franca then , and rome , together with its role model greece , was the cradle of modern european civilization .
it 's exactly this attempt to understand one 's roots and find a common european identity that is driving latin 's current renewal , according to hartmut loos , chair of the german philology association . students who read ovid , for example , experience the mythology that has left its mark on western culture and discover how europe got its name through the abduction of europa by the roman god jupiter .
possibly trivial , but nomen est omen , particularly in the age of globalization . " no subject is better suited than latin to help us understand our common european roots , " loos said .
" it is the mother of european languages , and allows students clear insight into europe 's cultural tradition .
latin is a multifaceted instrument that imparts language , methodical , cultural , and personal skills . " better teaching methods , more interested students while many who took latin in the past have not-so-fond memories of late-night memorizing of verb tables and conjugation patterns , current latin learners have a largely different experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum tour in bremen - in latin , of course today 's students are spared the tedious task of parsing and translating each and every word .
what 's important is not the rote learning of dative and ablative forms , but the ability to analyze the content of julius caesar 's gallic wars , or illustrate how cicero 's republic is relevant to modern democracy . also , pupils today are left more often to their own resources .
they work together in groups and present their findings to their classmates , instead of just responding to teacher 's questions .
in the words of one of germany 's leading educators , friedrich maier , latin instruction is meant to build character and not to be just a grammar drill . textbook editors have also dramatically altered the content of teaching materials by adding more information about roman culture , politics , philosophy and daily life . milosevic mortuus latin is not , however , simply popular with teenagers .
one of the biggest advocates of antiquity and the classical languages in the classroom is the country 's most popular quiz show host , günter jauch . the 49-year-old who asks the questions for the german version of who wants to be a millionaire ? admits that latin and greek are difficult .
but he compares learning classic languages to taking a trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter jauch , popular quiz show host and promoter of the classics " latin is like taking the long way , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" if i want to get from a to b fastest , then i 'll drive on the autobahn .
the beauty in travel though is the stops in between , or traveling through the villages . " many latin teachers enjoy their work also and try to bring the " dead " language to vibrant life .
seven schoolteachers in the northern city of bremen compile and broadcast a radio bulletin in latin with the month 's top local , national and international news stories from around the world .
in march , the demise of a former leader in the balkans was the lead item : milosevic mortuus . quidquid latine dictum sit , altum viditur .
translation : " anything said in latin sounds profound .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.04.2006 50 years of " intellectual pilgrimage " : emil nolde and seebüll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil nolde 's self portrait bold and eccentric , emil nolde is one of germany 's most famous expressionist painters .
upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .
but their admission fees of four euros -lrb- $ 4.83 -rrb- do not nearly cover the maintenance costs .
the foundation lives from the sale and reproduction royalties from nolde 's works .
however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .
beginning in april , a new " nolde shuttle bus " will also bring visitors from the island of sylt , looking for a break from overcrowded beaches and sunburn , directly to the museum 's door . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating the roots of expressionism 100 years have passed since the founding of the influential art group , " die brücke " or " the bridge .

-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- spectacular art theft in berlin shockwaves ripple through berlin ’ s art-loving community amid reports of thieves having walked off with nine valuable expressionist paintings from the bruecke museum .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .
but their admission fees of four euros -lrb- $ 4.83 -rrb- do not nearly cover the maintenance costs .
the foundation lives from the sale and reproduction royalties from nolde 's works .
however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .
beginning in april , a new " nolde shuttle bus " will also bring visitors from the island of sylt , looking for a break from overcrowded beaches and sunburn , directly to the museum 's door . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating the roots of expressionism 100 years have passed since the founding of the influential art group , " die brücke " or " the bridge .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .
but their admission fees of four euros -lrb- $ 4.83 -rrb- do not nearly cover the maintenance costs .
the foundation lives from the sale and reproduction royalties from nolde 's works .
however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .
beginning in april , a new " nolde shuttle bus " will also bring visitors from the island of sylt , looking for a break from overcrowded beaches and sunburn , directly to the museum 's door . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating the roots of expressionism 100 years have passed since the founding of the influential art group , " die brücke " or " the bridge .

germany has appealed to the iranian government to stop its uranium enrichment program . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad on thursday shunned international demands to freeze his country 's controversial nuclear drive , as the head of the united nations atomic agency , mohamed elbaradei , flew into tehran in a bid to head off an escalation of the crisis . " the situation is completely changed .
we are a nuclear state , " hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad said in the wake of a breakthrough in the country 's disputed nuclear energy drive , seen in the west as a mask for weapons development . iran announced this week that its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is peaceful , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead .
the un security council has set april 28 as a deadline for tehran to halt enrichment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is adamant about iran 's nuclear ambitions " we will not negotiate on our rights with anyone , " ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by the official news agency irna .
he added that nobody in the country " has the right to step back one iota from the path we are following . " elbaradei tries to negotiate international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohamed elbaradei arrived in tehran during the night for talks with the regime 's top nuclear negotiator and a message that appeared to be falling on deaf ears . " we hope to convince iran to take confidence-building measures including suspension of uranium enrichment activities until outstanding issues are clarified , " elbaradei told journalists at the airport . " i would like to see iran has come to terms with the request of the international community , " adding that he still remained " hopeful the time is right for political solutions , through negotiations . " elbaradei must give a report at the end of april on iran 's nuclear activities to the un security council and the 35 states of the iaea 's governing council . world powers consider stronger action toward iran representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with the long-running stand-off set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier us secretary of state condoleezza rice called for the 15-member security council to take " strong steps " and the white house said sanctions were now an option . officials from permanent security council members britain , france and russia , as well as german officials , all said iran had taken a " step in the wrong direction . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told german broadcaster ard that suspicions about iran 's nuclear ambitions were triggered by tehran 's years-long , clandestine nuclear research .
he said iran 's statements about its progress in atomic technology were a " renewed provocation that must not only be rejected , but which have also reinforced -lrb- international -rrb- concerns . " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , however , was quoted as strongly opposing the use of force after us reports over the weekend suggested washington was considering military action - even a possible nuclear strike . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans and french criticize iran nuclear claim germany and france said wednesday iran 's claim to have enriched uranium on its own was a step in the wrong direction .

germany has appealed to the iranian government to stop its uranium enrichment program . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad on thursday shunned international demands to freeze his country 's controversial nuclear drive , as the head of the united nations atomic agency , mohamed elbaradei , flew into tehran in a bid to head off an escalation of the crisis . " the situation is completely changed .
we are a nuclear state , " hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad said in the wake of a breakthrough in the country 's disputed nuclear energy drive , seen in the west as a mask for weapons development . iran announced this week that its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .
the islamic republic insists its program is peaceful , but the enrichment process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear warhead .

" i would like to see iran has come to terms with the request of the international community , " adding that he still remained " hopeful the time is right for political solutions , through negotiations . " elbaradei must give a report at the end of april on iran 's nuclear activities to the un security council and the 35 states of the iaea 's governing council . world powers consider stronger action toward iran representatives of the five permanent members of the council plus germany are to meet in moscow next tuesday to discuss the crisis , with the long-running stand-off set to enter a period of far more robust diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier us secretary of state condoleezza rice called for the 15-member security council to take " strong steps " and the white house said sanctions were now an option . officials from permanent security council members britain , france and russia , as well as german officials , all said iran had taken a " step in the wrong direction .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .

the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .
but their admission fees of four euros -lrb- $ 4.83 -rrb- do not nearly cover the maintenance costs .
the foundation lives from the sale and reproduction royalties from nolde 's works .
however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .
beginning in april , a new " nolde shuttle bus " will also bring visitors from the island of sylt , looking for a break from overcrowded beaches and sunburn , directly to the museum 's door . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating the roots of expressionism 100 years have passed since the founding of the influential art group , " die brücke " or " the bridge .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .

whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .

her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .

" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german .

" you 're lying ! " the man yelled , " that 's the biggest load of crap i 've ever heard . " his outburst was sparked by author peter pfütze 's assertion that all of the 550 west germans who were imprisoned by the stasi from the mid-1970s on had confessed to crimes the secret police accused them of .
" i spent nine years and eight months in prison and i never confessed , " the man continued . the two books , both written by former employees of the gdr secret police , aim to present the notorious organization as just another intelligence service , along the lines of the cia or west germany 's bnd , but which has been unfairly demonized in the wake of east germany 's collapse . questionable history one of the books , " der botschaftsflüchtling " -lrb- " the refugee from the embassy " -rrb- , by gotthold schramm , contains accounts from former stasi spies operating across the border in then west germany .
markus wolf , the east germans ' chief spy , contributed a foreword to schramm 's book . the book contains accounts of the experiences of 35 former stasi agents , which the publisher describes as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . " the other , entitled " besuchszeit " -lrb- " visiting hours " -rrb- and written by former stasi officer pfütze , insists that prisoners were treated well .
in the book , he describes visits west german diplomats were allowed to make to west germans imprisoned by the east german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former stasi prison hohenschönhausen in eastern berlin " the prisoners were treated correctly , " pfütze told the audience , some of whom then erupted into sarcastic laughter . the two authors presented the gdr as a country which respected the rule of law , which operated very normally within the framework of its own constitutional framework . " the gdr was recognized by 180 nations , " said schramm .
" tell me , were they all idiots ? " tense atmosphere but the atmosphere in the room was tense , and the two authors ' talks were often interrupted by catcalls , mostly from former prisoners or family members of those persecuted by the east german regime .
a man claiming to be a psychologist in the former east germany interrupted comments from schramm and claimed the stasi used " psychological methods of torture . " schramm rejected the man 's accusations that the stasi were " fascists , " saying : " we were not nazis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files have to be painstakingly reconstructed in many cases the books ' release comes in the wake of another high-profile instance of former stasi member publicly defending their actions under the former communist regime .
in march , some 200 former officers disrupted a meeting at the hohenschönhausen site , a former stasi prison in berlin and now a museum and memorial . the officers called many of the former victims of the secret service " liars " when they described the terror , abuse and suffering they experienced at the prison . marianne birthler , head of the authority which researches stasi records , called this new public resurfacing of former stasi officers alarming . " they are spreading aggressive propaganda , organized themselves and disturbing gatherings , " she warned . the stasi compiled surveillance files on approximately 6,000,000 east german citizens - more than one-third of the population . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film takes uncompromising look at gdr police state a debut film by a young german director about east germany 's secret police has critics raving and awards piling up .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .

the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .

rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .

by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .

it 's not naming names , but some suspect the country is sweden . citing a clear breach of the country 's human rights duties , the council of europe , the continent 's human rights watchdog , declined to name the country in question , but said the nation had secretly transferred suspects .
the body said it was up to national authorities or the european court of human rights to act . " we have received official acknowledgement of handing over ' individuals to foreign officials " in violation of the european convention on human rights , council general secretary terry davis said .
" i am now in position to say that we no longer need to speak about ' alleged ' cases of rendition , " he added , referring to the process in which prisoners are transferred to jails in third countries where they faced torture and other abuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis in november , davis imposed a three-month deadline on the council 's 46 member states to provide information relating to suspicions that the american cia has run a network of secret jails in europe for al qaeda suspects . the council decided not to name the state that had admitted to the wrongdoing , davis ' spokesman matjas gruden told reuters .
but " everything will be very transparent .
we will publish the responses " once the responses have been collated over the next two weeks . sweden guilty party ? some say the country in question might be sweden , where security services have come under criticism for the expulsion of two egyptian terrorism suspects who were then handed over to us agents and flown home aboard a us government-leased aircraft in 2001 .
the organization human rights watch has said there is credible evidence that the two were later tortured . while the swedish government has thus far declined to comment , opposition politician cecilia wilkstrom told reuters .
" i would put some money on sweden . "

it is expected to release an interim draft report next month . " we 'll say there is enough material to go on investigating and to keep up the pressure , " she told reuters . a washington post article last november first made the explosive accusations that the cia ran secret prisons in eastern europe for al qaeda suspects , but after several months the issue largely faded from view .
these new developments have put it in the headlines again . german investigation a german parliamentary inquiry will begin work on may 11 , examining the case of german citizen khaled al-masri , who was arrested at the end of 2003 and flown to afghanistan where he was held for months as a terrorist suspect by the us . al-masri was later released without charge and is now suing the former head of the cia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid al-masri the german committee is also expected to look into the use of german airports for dozens of unexplained cia flights . the us acknowledges it has used secret prison transfers , but denies that it " outsources torture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.04.2006 amo , amas , amat : german students ' love affair with latin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genitive , vocative , ablative - a lot of german students are n't intimidated by latin grammar while many students consider latin a grammatical nightmare of declensions , cases and genders which must be painfully memorized , the tongue of julius caesar , cicero et al. is a popular subject in german schools . at german schools , latin is currently the third most popular foreign language among secondary school students and it 's gaining in popularity .
the status of the language of the ancient romans and mother of several modern european tongues is even greater than that of world tongue spanish .
italian , a child of latin , ca n't hold a candle to its parent as far as numbers of students go . in 2003 , 654,000 german students between the ages of 14-18 were busy declining a -stem nouns and conjugating i -stem verbs .
two years later , that number increased more than 13 percent to 740,000 .
only english , with 10 times the number of learners , and french , two-and-a-half times as popular , beat latin in the foreign language race . returning to europe 's roots the popularity of latin in germany coincides with a unification of europe .
it is a phenomenon somewhat similar to the era when augustus caesar 's empire stretched from gaul in the northwest to asia minor in the southeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius caesar , emperor of rome and conqueror of much of europe latin was the lingua franca then , and rome , together with its role model greece , was the cradle of modern european civilization .
it 's exactly this attempt to understand one 's roots and find a common european identity that is driving latin 's current renewal , according to hartmut loos , chair of the german philology association . students who read ovid , for example , experience the mythology that has left its mark on western culture and discover how europe got its name through the abduction of europa by the roman god jupiter .
possibly trivial , but nomen est omen , particularly in the age of globalization . " no subject is better suited than latin to help us understand our common european roots , " loos said .
" it is the mother of european languages , and allows students clear insight into europe 's cultural tradition .
latin is a multifaceted instrument that imparts language , methodical , cultural , and personal skills . " better teaching methods , more interested students while many who took latin in the past have not-so-fond memories of late-night memorizing of verb tables and conjugation patterns , current latin learners have a largely different experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum tour in bremen - in latin , of course today 's students are spared the tedious task of parsing and translating each and every word .
what 's important is not the rote learning of dative and ablative forms , but the ability to analyze the content of julius caesar 's gallic wars , or illustrate how cicero 's republic is relevant to modern democracy . also , pupils today are left more often to their own resources .
they work together in groups and present their findings to their classmates , instead of just responding to teacher 's questions .
in the words of one of germany 's leading educators , friedrich maier , latin instruction is meant to build character and not to be just a grammar drill . textbook editors have also dramatically altered the content of teaching materials by adding more information about roman culture , politics , philosophy and daily life . milosevic mortuus latin is not , however , simply popular with teenagers .
one of the biggest advocates of antiquity and the classical languages in the classroom is the country 's most popular quiz show host , günter jauch . the 49-year-old who asks the questions for the german version of who wants to be a millionaire ? admits that latin and greek are difficult .
but he compares learning classic languages to taking a trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter jauch , popular quiz show host and promoter of the classics " latin is like taking the long way , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" if i want to get from a to b fastest , then i 'll drive on the autobahn .
the beauty in travel though is the stops in between , or traveling through the villages . " many latin teachers enjoy their work also and try to bring the " dead " language to vibrant life .
seven schoolteachers in the northern city of bremen compile and broadcast a radio bulletin in latin with the month 's top local , national and international news stories from around the world .
in march , the demise of a former leader in the balkans was the lead item : milosevic mortuus . quidquid latine dictum sit , altum viditur .
translation : " anything said in latin sounds profound .

the status of the language of the ancient romans and mother of several modern european tongues is even greater than that of world tongue spanish .
italian , a child of latin , ca n't hold a candle to its parent as far as numbers of students go . in 2003 , 654,000 german students between the ages of 14-18 were busy declining a -stem nouns and conjugating i -stem verbs .
two years later , that number increased more than 13 percent to 740,000 .
only english , with 10 times the number of learners , and french , two-and-a-half times as popular , beat latin in the foreign language race . returning to europe 's roots the popularity of latin in germany coincides with a unification of europe .
it is a phenomenon somewhat similar to the era when augustus caesar 's empire stretched from gaul in the northwest to asia minor in the southeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius caesar , emperor of rome and conqueror of much of europe latin was the lingua franca then , and rome , together with its role model greece , was the cradle of modern european civilization .
it 's exactly this attempt to understand one 's roots and find a common european identity that is driving latin 's current renewal , according to hartmut loos , chair of the german philology association . students who read ovid , for example , experience the mythology that has left its mark on western culture and discover how europe got its name through the abduction of europa by the roman god jupiter .
possibly trivial , but nomen est omen , particularly in the age of globalization . " no subject is better suited than latin to help us understand our common european roots , " loos said .
" it is the mother of european languages , and allows students clear insight into europe 's cultural tradition .
latin is a multifaceted instrument that imparts language , methodical , cultural , and personal skills . " better teaching methods , more interested students while many who took latin in the past have not-so-fond memories of late-night memorizing of verb tables and conjugation patterns , current latin learners have a largely different experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum tour in bremen - in latin , of course today 's students are spared the tedious task of parsing and translating each and every word .
what 's important is not the rote learning of dative and ablative forms , but the ability to analyze the content of julius caesar 's gallic wars , or illustrate how cicero 's republic is relevant to modern democracy . also , pupils today are left more often to their own resources .
they work together in groups and present their findings to their classmates , instead of just responding to teacher 's questions .
in the words of one of germany 's leading educators , friedrich maier , latin instruction is meant to build character and not to be just a grammar drill . textbook editors have also dramatically altered the content of teaching materials by adding more information about roman culture , politics , philosophy and daily life . milosevic mortuus latin is not , however , simply popular with teenagers .
one of the biggest advocates of antiquity and the classical languages in the classroom is the country 's most popular quiz show host , günter jauch . the 49-year-old who asks the questions for the german version of who wants to be a millionaire ? admits that latin and greek are difficult .
but he compares learning classic languages to taking a trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter jauch , popular quiz show host and promoter of the classics " latin is like taking the long way , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" if i want to get from a to b fastest , then i 'll drive on the autobahn .
the beauty in travel though is the stops in between , or traveling through the villages . " many latin teachers enjoy their work also and try to bring the " dead " language to vibrant life .
seven schoolteachers in the northern city of bremen compile and broadcast a radio bulletin in latin with the month 's top local , national and international news stories from around the world .
in march , the demise of a former leader in the balkans was the lead item : milosevic mortuus . quidquid latine dictum sit , altum viditur .
translation : " anything said in latin sounds profound . " john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ni hao " rather than " bonjour " in german classrooms english , french and spanish have long been the primary foreign languages in german schools .
but there 's a new kid on the block : chinese is popping up more frequently on class schedules as china 's economic might grows .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany leads latin revival just when you thought that " dumbing down " had got the better of everyone , it seems that germany has rediscovered the joys of latin .

but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .

he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .

rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .

by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .

germany has appealed to the iranian government to stop its uranium enrichment program . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad on thursday shunned international demands to freeze his country 's controversial nuclear drive , as the head of the united nations atomic agency , mohamed elbaradei , flew into tehran in a bid to head off an escalation of the crisis . " the situation is completely changed .
we are a nuclear state , " hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad said in the wake of a breakthrough in the country 's disputed nuclear energy drive , seen in the west as a mask for weapons development . iran announced this week that its scientists had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

" controversial timing the issue has attracted attention just one month before a visit by german-born pope benedict xvi to auschwitz in his first journey to his predecessor 's homeland since assuming the his position .
it also follows a stern warning from the vatican to poland 's hard-line catholic radio maryja after the fundamentalist radio station - which claims to have an audience of around three million - aired anti-semitic statements by commentator stanislaw michalkiewicz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has reached out to jews in his first year as pope michalkiewicz accused jews of " humiliating poland internationally by demanding money " for goods and property expropriated during world war ii . " we look after democratic issues in ukraine and belarus , while in our own backyard , ' kikes ' sneak up behind us to try to oblige our government to pay them money on the pretext of these demands , " he said . some conservatives say the vatican issued the warnings because the pope is german . in a comment broadcast on radio maryja and published in its sister publication , nasz dziennik , boguslaw wolniewicz , an academic , said : " i have a sneaking suspicion that those who were behind the latest attack -lrb- on radio maryja -rrb- are trying to exploit the fact that the new pope is german and would be ill-placed to defend someone whom the media and some in his entourage have accused of anti-semitism .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .

whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

germany has appealed to the iranian government to stop its uranium enrichment program . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad on thursday shunned international demands to freeze his country 's controversial nuclear drive , as the head of the united nations atomic agency , mohamed elbaradei , flew into tehran in a bid to head off an escalation of the crisis .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .
but their admission fees of four euros -lrb- $ 4.83 -rrb- do not nearly cover the maintenance costs .
the foundation lives from the sale and reproduction royalties from nolde 's works .
however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .

" small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .
but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved . " togo 's new cultural ambassadors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing strong for togo : aziabou and klein with regional coordinator ali tchassanti the fan club has big plans for the games .

but all ideas are still waiting for sponsors to make them happen .
if nothing else , the first yellow and green fan shirts are already made . " we want to fans to cheer on the togolese national team , " klein said .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .

the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .

rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .

along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .
we have germans , togolese , other africans , even turkish members . " small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .
but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved . " togo 's new cultural ambassadors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing strong for togo : aziabou and klein with regional coordinator ali tchassanti the fan club has big plans for the games .
their web site supports togolese who want to attend the games with information and accommodations .
they also plan to set up an intercultural café in berlin , organize dancing and music for togolese fans during the preliminary matches , and get a team togo together for a fan soccer tournament .
but all ideas are still waiting for sponsors to make them happen .
if nothing else , the first yellow and green fan shirts are already made . " we want to fans to cheer on the togolese national team , " klein said .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .
we have germans , togolese , other africans , even turkish members . " small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .
but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved . " togo 's new cultural ambassadors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing strong for togo : aziabou and klein with regional coordinator ali tchassanti the fan club has big plans for the games .
their web site supports togolese who want to attend the games with information and accommodations .
they also plan to set up an intercultural café in berlin , organize dancing and music for togolese fans during the preliminary matches , and get a team togo together for a fan soccer tournament .
but all ideas are still waiting for sponsors to make them happen .
if nothing else , the first yellow and green fan shirts are already made . " we want to fans to cheer on the togolese national team , " klein said .
" but we also want awake interest in togo in general .
we will keep the club going , even after the games are over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 german court convicts turk of " honor killing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü 's brother said he regrets her murder in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing . a berlin court convicted a 19-year-old turkish man for gunning down his sister on a berlin street last year but acquitted his two older brothers of involvement in her death on thursday . ayhan sürücü , who confessed to shooting 23-year-old hatan sürücü in the head in february 2005 , was sentenced to nine years in prison .
under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .

for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .

that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .

the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .

whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

six months later , the club has over 700 members throughout germany . sven klein has just finished his university business degree .
but he is n't sending out job applications yet - being vice-president of the german-togolese soccer fan club that he and his togolese friend kossi aziabou founded last october has turned out to be more work than he expected . " we are promoting the fan club at various conferences to attract sponsors and meet with the press , " klein said .
" i think that i will have to wait until the world cup is over to start thinking about getting a real job . " totally togo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan club founders kossi aziabou and sven klein while many bilateral " friendship " clubs are born out of political or business interests , the german-togolese soccer fan club has personal roots .
klein and aziabou have been friends for years and both are soccer fans .
as the togolese national team , the eperviers -lrb- sparrow hawks -rrb- , got closer to qualifying for the world cup , the two were in constant contact .
aziabou , a togolese embassy employee in berlin and president of the fan club , was surprised at his friend 's enthusiasm for his home team . " during togo 's last qualification round against congo , i was watching at home and sven had his eye on the fifa internet ticker , " aziabou said .
" he kept calling me to talk about the game .
when the eperviers won , we decided that we had to do something to support them . " flying high in honor of togo 's debut world cup qualification , klein and aziabou founded the german-togolese soccer fan club - with no budget , no base and just a handful of enthusiasts .
when they told friends about it , one offered to set up a free web site for the group .
soon , people from all over germany were signing up . " i was totally surprised , " aziabou said .
" i thought that the club would be like five people sitting on my couch watching the games together .
and now there are over 700 members , from all over germany .
we have germans , togolese , other africans , even turkish members . " small size , big response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo : soccer , sand and savanna after just six months , the club now has four regional coordinators to mobilize fans throughout the country .
but it is n't always easy .
klein said that many people are hard pressed to even place togo on a map .
the country is one of africa 's smallest , a sliver of land that 's smaller than bavaria , pressed between ghana and benin . " but everyone who hears about them is really enthusiastic , " klein said .
" maybe it 's because of the national colors -lrb- green , yellow , red and white -rrb- , maybe because it 's such a small country .
maybe it is because this will be their first time at the world cup .
people just like them . " rallying for support at the international soccer fan congress in bonn , the two friends presented their group 's ideas for the world cup .
helping them drum up support were four former togo national players . " it is difficult to get into contact with togolese fans back home , " aziabou said .
" but we finally got into contact with these older togolese players that now live in france .
they are big names in togolese soccer history and have a lot of fans .
i think with their support , we have a chance to get even more people in togo involved . " togo 's new cultural ambassadors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing strong for togo : aziabou and klein with regional coordinator ali tchassanti the fan club has big plans for the games .
their web site supports togolese who want to attend the games with information and accommodations .
they also plan to set up an intercultural café in berlin , organize dancing and music for togolese fans during the preliminary matches , and get a team togo together for a fan soccer tournament .
but all ideas are still waiting for sponsors to make them happen .
if nothing else , the first yellow and green fan shirts are already made . " we want to fans to cheer on the togolese national team , " klein said .

quite a lot , according to poland . the polish government wants unesco to clearly describe the former auschwitz death camp as " nazi " and " german " in the un culture organization 's list of world heritage sites .
they say it shopuld be officially designated as the " former nazi german auschwitz-birkenau concentration camp . " at the moment the un culture organization lists the site as the " auschwitz concentration camp , " but says in its accompanying description that the " fortified walls , barbed wire , platforms , barracks , gallows , gas chambers and cremation ovens show the conditions within which the nazi genocide took place in the former concentration and extermination camp of auschwitz-birkenau , the largest in the third reich . " " we can not continue to ignore repeated publications that defame poland , " jan kasprzyk , a culture ministry official told reuters .
" the new name is completely accurate .

polish officials have long complained to journalists to no avail , they said . redefining history ? the world jewish congress has voiced opposition to the polish request , saying that the country wants to redefine history with the name change . " although the camp had been built and run by nazi germany , everybody in the area had known about its existence and workers were recruited from the polish population in the neighboring village , " wjc officials told german news agency dpa in a statement . but wladyslaw bartoszewski , the head of the international auschwitz council and a former camp prisoner disagreed , telling the news agency that " none of the local residents worked at auschwitz . " controversial timing the issue has attracted attention just one month before a visit by german-born pope benedict xvi to auschwitz in his first journey to his predecessor 's homeland since assuming the his position .

it 's not naming names , but some suspect the country is sweden . citing a clear breach of the country 's human rights duties , the council of europe , the continent 's human rights watchdog , declined to name the country in question , but said the nation had secretly transferred suspects .
the body said it was up to national authorities or the european court of human rights to act . " we have received official acknowledgement of handing over ' individuals to foreign officials " in violation of the european convention on human rights , council general secretary terry davis said .
" i am now in position to say that we no longer need to speak about ' alleged ' cases of rendition , " he added , referring to the process in which prisoners are transferred to jails in third countries where they faced torture and other abuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis in november , davis imposed a three-month deadline on the council 's 46 member states to provide information relating to suspicions that the american cia has run a network of secret jails in europe for al qaeda suspects . the council decided not to name the state that had admitted to the wrongdoing , davis ' spokesman matjas gruden told reuters .
but " everything will be very transparent .
we will publish the responses " once the responses have been collated over the next two weeks . sweden guilty party ? some say the country in question might be sweden , where security services have come under criticism for the expulsion of two egyptian terrorism suspects who were then handed over to us agents and flown home aboard a us government-leased aircraft in 2001 .
the organization human rights watch has said there is credible evidence that the two were later tortured . while the swedish government has thus far declined to comment , opposition politician cecilia wilkstrom told reuters .
" i would put some money on sweden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us air force c130 parked on a romanian airfield sarah ludford , a british liberal democratic member of the european parliament committee which is investigating cia prisons , agreed that sweden was a strong possibility . she added that that parliamentary committee was making headway in its own investigation .
it is expected to release an interim draft report next month . " we 'll say there is enough material to go on investigating and to keep up the pressure , " she told reuters . a washington post article last november first made the explosive accusations that the cia ran secret prisons in eastern europe for al qaeda suspects , but after several months the issue largely faded from view .
these new developments have put it in the headlines again . german investigation a german parliamentary inquiry will begin work on may 11 , examining the case of german citizen khaled al-masri , who was arrested at the end of 2003 and flown to afghanistan where he was held for months as a terrorist suspect by the us . al-masri was later released without charge and is now suing the former head of the cia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid al-masri the german committee is also expected to look into the use of german airports for dozens of unexplained cia flights . the us acknowledges it has used secret prison transfers , but denies that it " outsources torture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.04.2006 opinion : a murder becomes political großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpaslan sürücü -lrb- r -rrb- , one of the two brothers of the convicted , left the court a free man the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .
the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

italian , a child of latin , ca n't hold a candle to its parent as far as numbers of students go . in 2003 , 654,000 german students between the ages of 14-18 were busy declining a -stem nouns and conjugating i -stem verbs .
two years later , that number increased more than 13 percent to 740,000 .
only english , with 10 times the number of learners , and french , two-and-a-half times as popular , beat latin in the foreign language race . returning to europe 's roots the popularity of latin in germany coincides with a unification of europe .
it is a phenomenon somewhat similar to the era when augustus caesar 's empire stretched from gaul in the northwest to asia minor in the southeast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius caesar , emperor of rome and conqueror of much of europe latin was the lingua franca then , and rome , together with its role model greece , was the cradle of modern european civilization .
it 's exactly this attempt to understand one 's roots and find a common european identity that is driving latin 's current renewal , according to hartmut loos , chair of the german philology association . students who read ovid , for example , experience the mythology that has left its mark on western culture and discover how europe got its name through the abduction of europa by the roman god jupiter .
possibly trivial , but nomen est omen , particularly in the age of globalization . " no subject is better suited than latin to help us understand our common european roots , " loos said .
" it is the mother of european languages , and allows students clear insight into europe 's cultural tradition .
latin is a multifaceted instrument that imparts language , methodical , cultural , and personal skills . " better teaching methods , more interested students while many who took latin in the past have not-so-fond memories of late-night memorizing of verb tables and conjugation patterns , current latin learners have a largely different experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a museum tour in bremen - in latin , of course today 's students are spared the tedious task of parsing and translating each and every word .
what 's important is not the rote learning of dative and ablative forms , but the ability to analyze the content of julius caesar 's gallic wars , or illustrate how cicero 's republic is relevant to modern democracy . also , pupils today are left more often to their own resources .
they work together in groups and present their findings to their classmates , instead of just responding to teacher 's questions .
in the words of one of germany 's leading educators , friedrich maier , latin instruction is meant to build character and not to be just a grammar drill . textbook editors have also dramatically altered the content of teaching materials by adding more information about roman culture , politics , philosophy and daily life . milosevic mortuus latin is not , however , simply popular with teenagers .
one of the biggest advocates of antiquity and the classical languages in the classroom is the country 's most popular quiz show host , günter jauch . the 49-year-old who asks the questions for the german version of who wants to be a millionaire ? admits that latin and greek are difficult .
but he compares learning classic languages to taking a trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter jauch , popular quiz show host and promoter of the classics " latin is like taking the long way , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" if i want to get from a to b fastest , then i 'll drive on the autobahn .
the beauty in travel though is the stops in between , or traveling through the villages . " many latin teachers enjoy their work also and try to bring the " dead " language to vibrant life .
seven schoolteachers in the northern city of bremen compile and broadcast a radio bulletin in latin with the month 's top local , national and international news stories from around the world .
in march , the demise of a former leader in the balkans was the lead item : milosevic mortuus . quidquid latine dictum sit , altum viditur .

upon his death 50 years ago , his home in seebüll near the danish border became a museum that 's stark , idyllic - and easy to miss . for lack of a bridge to connect it to the mainland , there are only three ways to get to sylt , germany 's most popular island in the north sea : by plane , by danish ferry , or by train from niebüll .
cars load on in niebüll , too , and most of the 600,000 tourists to the island pass through the sleepy frisian town .
but only a fraction of these sand-struck visitors know that with a quick side trip , they could visit the former home of one of germany 's most important expressionist painters , emil nolde .
craftsman and artistic avant-garde born in 1867 , emil nolde was a trained wood-carver , who made furniture by day and took art lessons at night .
he studied the french impressionists , older masters like rembrandt , and took trips to visit artists in denmark and sweden .
nolde was looking for a new type of art - genuinely german , uniquely his .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worn by wind and weather : emil nolde but he was almost 30 before he made his first paintings , which resemble his drawings and wood-cuts : grotesque figures with bold lines and strong contrasts .
the style was new , and it inspired the nascent artist movement die brücke -lrb- the bridge -rrb- , who invited nolde to join them in 1906 .
he was a member for just a year , preferring winter solitude in berlin and summers by the sea .
bright blue cityscapes , bombastic red floral gardens , pink , yellow and red nudes : nolde 's emotional use of color became his calling card .
this was intensified after he and his wife , the danish actress ada vilstrup , returned from an expedition to this south seas in 1913/14 .
powerful poppies and bold brick in 1927 , the couple moved to seebüll , a nearly non-existent farming settlement in schleswig-holstein , just minutes from the danish border .
it is hard to find , but each year , 78,000 adventurers do drive down the long country road leading to nolde 's home , now a museum , perched atop one of the few tiny hills in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color and contrast : nolde 's biography and his art amidst the wide plains typical for northern germany , the building is like a brick fortress , with narrow windows and a flat roof .
the artist consciously chose the modern bauhaus-style design to distinguish it from his neighbors ' frisian thatched roofed farmhouses .
rich gardens surround the museum , with flowers - red poppies and bright blue lilies - so decidedly foreign to the region that they must be carefully sheltered from the strong winds that sweep up the hill .
here , nolde said , he came to recuperate from the overwhelming abundance that was berlin in the roaring twenties .
but in 1937 , seebüll became a retreat of a different kind .
along with other expressionists , the national socialists proclaimed emile nolde a " degenerate artist " and confiscated his works .
in 1941 , they prohibited him from painting altogether .
in a secret room in his house , nolde continued to paint watercolor sketches - most of them no bigger than the palm of his hand .
by the end of world war ii , nolde had completed more than 1,300 of these so-called " unpainted pictures . " they are on display at the museum , as are the large-scale religion-inspired oil paintings nolde worked on in the last years of his life .
not just for art pilgrims any more ten years before his death on april 13 , 1956 , emil nolde and his wife established the nolde foundation seebüll .
nolde wanted the museum to be a place where " intellectual pilgrims " could come for " happiness and artistic and spiritual relaxation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director manfred reuther wants to bring more visitors to enjoy nolde 's works over three and a half million art lovers have done so .
but their admission fees of four euros -lrb- $ 4.83 -rrb- do not nearly cover the maintenance costs .
the foundation lives from the sale and reproduction royalties from nolde 's works .
however , in 2026 , the foundation 's copyrights will expire .
this year , in preparation for that day , the foundation has built a new addition to the house , focusing on nolde 's life .
it is also planning an extension in berlin to focus on the artist 's work there .
beginning in april , a new " nolde shuttle bus " will also bring visitors from the island of sylt , looking for a break from overcrowded beaches and sunburn , directly to the museum 's door . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : celebrating the roots of expressionism 100 years have passed since the founding of the influential art group , " die brücke " or " the bridge .

under german law , the maximum he could receive was 10 years because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder . presiding judge michael degreif said that hatin sürücü had been killed " because she lived her life as she saw fit , " and had adopted western ideas of sexual equality . his brothers , mutlu and alpaslan sürücü , who were accused of conspiring to murder , were found not guilty .
ayhan sürücü had long insisted they had no involvement . the murder of the young , divorced mother of a five-year-old son shocked germany , especially after ayhan sürücü said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle .
he added that he now regretted his actions . trying to break free hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 .
her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and she subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she was trying to lead an independent life ayhan sürücü told prosecutors he was appalled by her western lifestyle and concerned about his nephew .
as a result , he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian seller and killed her . " it was too much for me , " he told the court .
" i grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger .
i do n't even understand what i did anymore . " prosecutors initially believed it was the oldest brother who had procured the weapon .
they thought that ayhan sürücü and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences before ayhan sürücü shot her . triggered debate though such killings have occurred before in germany , this case caused particular outrage and set off a heightened debate in germany over immigrant integration : germany has a turkish population of 2.6 million , 800,000 of whom live in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education has to be improved for turkish immigrants , german experts say and while most of the debated focused on ghettoization and the compatibility of islamic values with western ones , it was the reaction of a small group of turkish students to the murder that rattled germany . days after hatin sürücü was killed , some male students of turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act .
during a class discussion on the murder , one said , " she only had herself to blame , " while another remarked " she deserved what she got - the whore lived like a german . " such reactions cause alarm also among muslim leaders . " it might be a minority but even one person applauding is unacceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg . according to papatya , a berlin-based organization that seeks to help young turkish women , there were 45 known honor killings in germany from 1996 to 2004 , of which 13 occured in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : brother admits to honor killing a young turkish man told a berlin court wednesday that he murdered his sister earlier this year because he did n't approve of her lifestyle .

the sentence comes amid a needed debate on integration comments deutsche welle 's verica spasovska . by german standards , the sentence handed down by the judge in berlin was harsh : almost 10 years in jail for the young turkish man who killed his sister hatun execution style simply because she lived as she saw fit .
to condemn such a life and then extinguish it is an absurd understanding of the idea of honor and the judge was correct to punish such an act with an appropriately serious sentence . but even during the trial it was unclear what the real motive behind the killing was .
did the crime have something to do with a false understanding of islam or did the reasons revolve around something else in the family 's history ?
what is clear is that this honor killing is not a unique case . according to estimates by the united nations , some 5,000 such killings take place every year around the world , a few of those in germany .
the number of unreported cases is likely high .
these murders in the name of honor have little to do with islam , much more with patriarchal models in families which are often disadvantaged . many young immigrants misuse the concept of honor to conceal their own feelings of inferiority in a complex , competition-oriented society .
but one should n't conclude that the majority of turks living in germany approve of what hatun sürücü 's brother did .
this incident should not be used to stamp all immigrants in germany , especially muslim ones , as backwards .
still , germany should not just file the case away .
even though the incident is the exception rather than the rule , the subject has taken on political overtones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of hatun sürücü on the street where she was killed ayhan sürücü 's sentencing comes right in the middle of a debate about integration policy , which has been raging in germany for weeks now .
whether about citizenship tests for immigrants , language teaching or the despondent calls by berlin teachers who could no longer handle the violence in their schools , all these show clearly that the government has yet to come up with an effective approach to integration . policies unclear it does n't help that germany 's policies regarding immigrants have been anything but consistent .
for far too long , conservative politicians insisted that germany was not a land of immigration .
that , in turn , gave foreigners very few reasons to ever put down solid roots here .
on the other hand , the left-of-center fans of a multicultural society never even asked immigrants to try to integrate into the larger society .
that led to the development of so-called parallel societies and disadvantaged immigrant families , which after three generations now often find themselves living on welfare . clearly , immigration enriches german society .
and anyway , demographic developments mean immigrants are necessary for this fast-greying country .
but immigration must be guided .
the serious problem of young immigrants achieving less than their parents and remaining strangers to society must be solved for the long term .
integration will only have succeeded when the children of those who arrived in germany to work decades ago have a shot at a job and social advancement and enjoy the same opportunities as german children do . but for hatun sürücü , murdered in the street by a member of her own family , that will have come too late . verica spasovska -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german court convicts turk of " honor killing " in a case that captured international attention , the brother of a young german woman of turkish origin was sentenced to nine years in prison for murdering her in a so-called honor killing .

but as we set off in search of a new sofa , a flat packed wardrobe or specimen shrub , the aa is warning drivers not to overload their cars .
its research suggests that 21 % of drivers admit to driving with an item poking out of the sunroof , window or boot .
and it 's warning that even a small tin of paint can become a dangerous projectile in a collision .
we found out how to safely load your car with the help of the aa on breakfast this morning with the help of the aa motoring trust , we 've put together a common sense guide to safely loading your car on a trip to a diy superstore or garden centre - see below for more details modern day furnishing superstores often keep their costs low by letting customers select their own furniture items .
having made your selection in the showroom , it can be a little tricky to assess how big the item will be when it 's packaged .
the aa says that 15 % of drivers it surveyed admit to over loading their car to the point of obstructing their vision .
and it also discovered that passengers were being put at risk from objects placed on seats - another 15 % of drivers surveyed admitted to this .
what can you do to make sure your car is loaded safely ?
the aa motoring trust has come up with the following , commonsense advice for loading your car : prioritise be realistic about what you can fit into the space .
decide which items are the most important when you 're shopping , rather than when you get to your car stay safe never place heavy items like paint tins high up in the back or elsewhere in the cabin - small objects can become dangerous projectiles in the event of a crash location heavy items like pot plants or furniture in the boot must be put hard up against the rear seatbacks to make sure the weight is distributed across the back axle plan ahead even with a large boot , you can find yourself running out of space if you do n't plan carefully , so put the biggest purchases at the bottom and place smaller items in the space around them tyre pressures always check that tyre pressures are correctly adjusted in line with the manufacturer 's handbook before setting off - especially when carrying a heavy load drive defensively your car 's handling and performance will be affected by any load , so take care on the roads , especially while braking as slowing down may take longer than anticipated insure yourself certain heavy or unwieldy loads may invalidate your insurance policy - so make sure you check the small print before strapping that chest of drawers to your roof rack see and be seen some protruding loads may mean you have to fit extra visible signs on your car - for example if you ¿ re transporting timber on your roof rack .
always ask an expert before you set off finally , you should always refer to your vehicle 's manual for the correct information about maximum loads , fitting a roof rack and safe tyre pressures .
and you should also take special care when attaching a trailer to your vehicle .

recipes from the boke of cokery , richard pynson 1500 © marquess of bath , longleat house pomes moled -lrb- apple pudding -rrb- take rice and grind it and boil it with almond milk ; then take apples and cut them finely and put them in after bringing the mixture to a boil , and add sugar and good spices , and colour it with saffron , and dress it in dishes and serve it .
ingredients : 1lb or 500g cooking apples 2 to 4 oz or half to one cup ground almonds -lrb- 50 to 100gr -rrb- three quarters of a pint or 2 cups water -lrb- 500 ml -rrb- 4 tbsp rice flour -lrb- 50 ml -rrb- 2 to 4 fl oz or quarter to half a cup of sugar -lrb- 50 - 125 ml -rrb- half tsp cinnamon -lrb- 2 ml -rrb- quarter tsp ginger -lrb- 1 ml -rrb- pinch each of : ground cloves , salt , nutmeg ; ground saffron -lrb- optional pinch -rrb- steep the ground almonds in the water , then blend or process into almond milk .
while it is steeping , peel and core the apples and dice them finely , or chop them in a food processor .
mix sugar , rice flour , and almond milk in a saucepan ; stir in the apples and bring to a boil over medium heat .
stir and boil about 5 minutes , or until quite thick .
in a small bowl combine a spoonful of the pudding with all seasonings except nutmeg , then stir this mixture back into the pot of pudding .
when thoroughly blended , pour into a serving dish ; sprinkle with nutmeg and cool or chill .
saracen bruet for ten messes -lrb- saracen stew -rrb- to make saracen bruet for ten messes , take good broth of beef and wine and set it on the fire to boil .
add to it cloves , mace , pine nuts , currants , sugar , and minced ginger , and thicken your pottage with small pieces of bread steeped in wine and dissolved in the wine .
then take parboiled rabbits chopped , or whole very young rabbits for a lord , fried in fresh grease ; then take parboiled partridges and fry them whole for a lord , and add them to the pot .
and for a lord , take squirrels in place of rabbits .
colour it with saffron and sanders , and add a little vinegar and ground cinnamon drawn with wine .
when you take it off the fire , add ginger ; let the sauce be fairly thin , and salt it .
and for a lord serve a whole rabbit on a dish , or else rabbits and partridges on a dish together , and serve it .
note : those who wish to substitute chicken - or any other meat or poultry - for rabbits and / or partridges will still have what a medieval diner would have recognized as ' saracen ' stew ; the particular meat for this dish is variable .
furthermore , the original characteristic of the dish seems to have been frying the meat before adding it to the pot , a genuinely arab practice , and , especially in england , the preferred colour of the sauce was red : a red dye was often added , a role filled here by sanders .
ingredients : about 3 lbs rabbits , partridges , chickens , or whatever , -lrb- approx 1.5 kg -rrb- grease of your choice for frying half pint or 1 cup each beef broth , red wine -lrb- 250 ml each -rrb- quarter tsp ground cloves -lrb- 1 ml -rrb- half tsp ground mace -lrb- 2 ml -rrb- 4 tbsp or quarter cup pine nuts -lrb- 50 ml -rrb- 4 tbsp or quarter cup currants -lrb- 50 ml -rrb- 2 tbsp minced preserved -lrb- candied -rrb- ginger -lrb- 25 ml -rrb- 2 tsp sugar -lrb- 10 ml -rrb- 2 slices bread , crusts removed , diced 4 fl oz or half cup red wine -lrb- 125 ml -rrb- pinch ground saffron -lrb- optional -rrb- , pinch sanders or red food dye , 1 tbsp red wine vinegar -lrb- 15 ml -rrb- half tsp each ground cinnamon and ginger -lrb- 2 ml each -rrb- 1 tsp salt -lrb- or to taste -rrb- -lrb- 4 ml -rrb- there is probably no need to parboil the meat or poultry today , but do so if you suspect it may be tough .
in any case cut the meat into serving pieces and fry it to brown lightly .
meanwhile , put the broth and wine in a pot and heat , adding the cloves , mace , pine nuts , currants , sugar and ginger .
steep the bread in more red wine -lrb- saving a little to dissolve the cinnamon -rrb- , then blend it and add to the pot .
when the sauce has lightly thickened and the meat is brown enough , add the meat to the pot and continue to cook until the meat is tender - the time will vary depending on what kind of meat or poultry you have chosen to use and whether it has been parboiled .
add saffron -lrb- if desired -rrb- , red colouring , ginger dissolved in the vinegar and cinnamon dissolved in a little red wine .
salt to taste .
a revised version of richard pynson 's book will be published later in the year .

recipes from the boke of cokery , richard pynson 1500 © marquess of bath , longleat house pomes moled -lrb- apple pudding -rrb- take rice and grind it and boil it with almond milk ; then take apples and cut them finely and put them in after bringing the mixture to a boil , and add sugar and good spices , and colour it with saffron , and dress it in dishes and serve it .
ingredients : 1lb or 500g cooking apples 2 to 4 oz or half to one cup ground almonds -lrb- 50 to 100gr -rrb- three quarters of a pint or 2 cups water -lrb- 500 ml -rrb- 4 tbsp rice flour -lrb- 50 ml -rrb- 2 to 4 fl oz or quarter to half a cup of sugar -lrb- 50 - 125 ml -rrb- half tsp cinnamon -lrb- 2 ml -rrb- quarter tsp ginger -lrb- 1 ml -rrb- pinch each of : ground cloves , salt , nutmeg ; ground saffron -lrb- optional pinch -rrb- steep the ground almonds in the water , then blend or process into almond milk .
while it is steeping , peel and core the apples and dice them finely , or chop them in a food processor .
mix sugar , rice flour , and almond milk in a saucepan ; stir in the apples and bring to a boil over medium heat .
stir and boil about 5 minutes , or until quite thick .
in a small bowl combine a spoonful of the pudding with all seasonings except nutmeg , then stir this mixture back into the pot of pudding .
when thoroughly blended , pour into a serving dish ; sprinkle with nutmeg and cool or chill .
saracen bruet for ten messes -lrb- saracen stew -rrb- to make saracen bruet for ten messes , take good broth of beef and wine and set it on the fire to boil .
add to it cloves , mace , pine nuts , currants , sugar , and minced ginger , and thicken your pottage with small pieces of bread steeped in wine and dissolved in the wine .
then take parboiled rabbits chopped , or whole very young rabbits for a lord , fried in fresh grease ; then take parboiled partridges and fry them whole for a lord , and add them to the pot .
and for a lord , take squirrels in place of rabbits .
colour it with saffron and sanders , and add a little vinegar and ground cinnamon drawn with wine .
when you take it off the fire , add ginger ; let the sauce be fairly thin , and salt it .
and for a lord serve a whole rabbit on a dish , or else rabbits and partridges on a dish together , and serve it .
note : those who wish to substitute chicken - or any other meat or poultry - for rabbits and / or partridges will still have what a medieval diner would have recognized as ' saracen ' stew ; the particular meat for this dish is variable .
furthermore , the original characteristic of the dish seems to have been frying the meat before adding it to the pot , a genuinely arab practice , and , especially in england , the preferred colour of the sauce was red : a red dye was often added , a role filled here by sanders .
ingredients : about 3 lbs rabbits , partridges , chickens , or whatever , -lrb- approx 1.5 kg -rrb- grease of your choice for frying half pint or 1 cup each beef broth , red wine -lrb- 250 ml each -rrb- quarter tsp ground cloves -lrb- 1 ml -rrb- half tsp ground mace -lrb- 2 ml -rrb- 4 tbsp or quarter cup pine nuts -lrb- 50 ml -rrb- 4 tbsp or quarter cup currants -lrb- 50 ml -rrb- 2 tbsp minced preserved -lrb- candied -rrb- ginger -lrb- 25 ml -rrb- 2 tsp sugar -lrb- 10 ml -rrb- 2 slices bread , crusts removed , diced 4 fl oz or half cup red wine -lrb- 125 ml -rrb- pinch ground saffron -lrb- optional -rrb- , pinch sanders or red food dye , 1 tbsp red wine vinegar -lrb- 15 ml -rrb- half tsp each ground cinnamon and ginger -lrb- 2 ml each -rrb- 1 tsp salt -lrb- or to taste -rrb- -lrb- 4 ml -rrb- there is probably no need to parboil the meat or poultry today , but do so if you suspect it may be tough .
in any case cut the meat into serving pieces and fry it to brown lightly .
meanwhile , put the broth and wine in a pot and heat , adding the cloves , mace , pine nuts , currants , sugar and ginger .
steep the bread in more red wine -lrb- saving a little to dissolve the cinnamon -rrb- , then blend it and add to the pot .
when the sauce has lightly thickened and the meat is brown enough , add the meat to the pot and continue to cook until the meat is tender - the time will vary depending on what kind of meat or poultry you have chosen to use and whether it has been parboiled .
add saffron -lrb- if desired -rrb- , red colouring , ginger dissolved in the vinegar and cinnamon dissolved in a little red wine .
salt to taste .
a revised version of richard pynson 's book will be published later in the year .

the talks were supposed to have been concluded at the end of last month .
but there are still disagreements over how to achieve the reductions in troops numbers and redeployments that have been promised .
six months ago the two sides agreed the broad outline of a plan to move some of the 50,000 us troops stationed here .
some would leave the country , others would be moved around to different bases within japan .
the plan is part of the us military 's realignment of its forces worldwide .
it is also designed to lighten the burden on the southern japanese island of okinawa , which hosts the majority of the us troops .
money row in recent months though , the plan has run into trouble as the two sides argue over who should foot the bill .
the united states wants japan to pay three quarters of the $ 10bn it will cost to move 7,000 us marines from okinawa to the us territory of guam .
japan has offered to pay just a third of the cost .
recent opinion polls here suggest most japanese support their government 's position .
there have been disagreements , too , over plans to move an airfield which is currently in a densely crowded urban area in okinawa .
the japanese government has found it hard to persuade other communities to accept a move of the airfield to their area .
last week though , the city of nago in central okinawa agreed to host it .
publicly both sides are upbeat now about the chances of an agreement .

it is also designed to lighten the burden on the southern japanese island of okinawa , which hosts the majority of the us troops .
money row in recent months though , the plan has run into trouble as the two sides argue over who should foot the bill .
the united states wants japan to pay three quarters of the $ 10bn it will cost to move 7,000 us marines from okinawa to the us territory of guam .
japan has offered to pay just a third of the cost .
recent opinion polls here suggest most japanese support their government 's position .
there have been disagreements , too , over plans to move an airfield which is currently in a densely crowded urban area in okinawa .
the japanese government has found it hard to persuade other communities to accept a move of the airfield to their area .
last week though , the city of nago in central okinawa agreed to host it .
publicly both sides are upbeat now about the chances of an agreement .
but before these two days of talks are concluded there 's a lot of horse trading still to do .

nationalists say no-one should wait longer than 18 weeks from gp referral to treatment by the end of 2011 .
if elected at holyrood , the snp would give patients a legal right to be treated within a specified period and the right of redress if it is not met .
the proposal was endorsed unanimously by delegates at the snp 's spring conference in dundee .
they also backed moves to make it easier for patients who receive sub-standard nhs healthcare to receive no-fault payouts , in order to prevent them having to go through the courts .
the snp will now consult on the detail of the proposals , to be included in the party 's manifesto for the 2007 holyrood election .
in february health minister andy kerr said the nhs in scotland had met the scottish executive 's target of having no patient waiting more than six months for treatment by the end of last year .
executive ' deception ' however , around a third of all patients waiting for nhs treatment in scotland are not included in the figures as they do not have a waiting time guarantee .
instead they are assigned availability status codes -lrb- ascs -rrb- for a range of reasons such as an inability to attend an appointment or due to a medical condition preventing treatment .
snp health spokeswoman shona robison told the conference on saturday that the party would introduce a patients ' rights act if elected to power at holyrood next may .
" the snp believes in cast iron rights for patients , not fiddled figures which this labour-liberal democrat executive has made a bit of an art form , " ms robison said .
" i think scotland has had enough of this deception and the snp will introduce a transparent system , based on the needs of the individual patient .
" we will treat patients as people not as statistics . "

wiltshire and swindon safety camera partnership -lrb- wsscp -rrb- began enforcing the 70mph limit in the county last april .
figures suggest that since then , there has been a 57.89 % cut in the number of people killed or seriously injured .
but campaign group safe speed , which opposes the cameras , said there was insufficient data to justify the claim .
spokesman paul smith said the assumptions should not be based on a single year 's figures , which did not take into account national trends and local conditions .
' danger unfounded ' " analysis and interpretation of road accident statistics requires considerable care and scrupulous honesty because road accidents are rare and exceptional events , " he said .
" it is necessary to separate random effects from real changes . "
david frampton , manager of the wsscp admitted there was no specific evidence to show that the cameras had caused the reduction .
but he said : " nothing else has changed on the motorway since they were introduced .
there are no extra police patrols , only the cameras , and we have fewer collisions , so we have to draw some conclusions .
" when we started enforcing on the m4 , some people said we would make the road more dangerous , these figures prove that this is not the case .
the signs and cameras encourage motorists to slow down . "
he added the partnership would continue to enforce the speed limit on the motorway .

the oscar-winning actor admitted resurrection blues , directed by robert altman , began poorly and " did n't go down as well as any of us had hoped " .
he said it was " not unusual for a show to come off early " .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme that it was " not a disaster " the theatre would now lie empty all summer .
the southwark-based old vic is one of the capital 's oldest theatres , having opened in 1818 . "
we must be doing something right even though 11 or 12 people who write for newspapers do n't particularly like what we 've done " kevin spacey spacey started running the old vic in 2003 and has a 10-year contract with the london theatre .
" we never announced a production for the summer slot and therefore we have n't cancelled anything - we just have n't scheduled anything , " he said .
" we took a view that if we could n't find the right production that we felt was financially right to produce , it was in our interest to put all of our resources and all of our efforts into the work that we 're about to announce at the beginning of may , " he said , referring to the old vic 's next run of plays .
" it 's not ideal , " he said , " but at the same time we 're trying to get a financially responsible position . "
spacey said the first time he saw the production of resurrection blues , he " knew it was in trouble " , resulting in several weeks of intensive work before it opened .
" the unfortunate thing that happened on opening night is that the actors got hit with a case of the nerves and it kind of fell apart on that evening , and i think the reviews reflected that .
" everyone was completely open and honest about the fact the show was n't where it should have gotten , but i can tell you that after the critics ' night , that cast pulled themselves together .
" they started to deliver that play in a way that i think audiences saw a much better production than those critics saw . "
' no apology ' he denied press reports that actress jane adams - who played emily - had stormed out of the play .
" that 's not true .
there were artistic differences and there was a mutual decision that she should leave the production . "
spacey added he was " more determined than ever " to complete his 10-year contract .
" this the middle of our second season , it 's very early going , nothing has put me off from our goal and our plan . "
he had no reason to say sorry , he said , because " i do n't think that 18 months in , that anyone needs to apologise for having done a programme that 's brought 425,000 people into the theatre " .
fundraising " that 's nearly more than two times the number of people that came into the old vic in the previous two seasons , " he said .
" we must be doing something right even though 11 or 12 people who write for newspapers do n't particularly like what we 've done . "
spacey , who has won oscars for the usual suspects and american beauty , has said fell in love with the old vic after being taken there during a childhood holiday .
he appeared on the old vic stage in 1998 , and was heavily involved in fund-raising and running the theatre since becoming a trustee that year .
the actor has invested more than £ 100,000 of his own money into the venue .

" we took a view that if we could n't find the right production that we felt was financially right to produce , it was in our interest to put all of our resources and all of our efforts into the work that we 're about to announce at the beginning of may , " he said , referring to the old vic 's next run of plays .

spacey admits resurrection blues got off to a bad start spacey said the first time he saw the production of resurrection blues , he " knew it was in trouble " , resulting in several weeks of intensive work before it opened .
" the unfortunate thing that happened on opening night is that the actors got hit with a case of the nerves and it kind of fell apart on that evening , and i think the reviews reflected that .
" everyone was completely open and honest about the fact the show was n't where it should have gotten , but i can tell you that after the critics ' night , that cast pulled themselves together .
