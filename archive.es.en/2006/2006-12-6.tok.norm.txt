" unemployment and the lack of a proper educational qualification are the main factors , " radermacher said while presenting the survey called " life in europe , " which focused on poverty . more than 40 percent of those without jobs and a quarter of those without proper qualifications are threatened by poverty compared to only 5 percent of those who are employed , he said . radermacher added , however , that the definition of " poor " is based on european standards . " you can not compare poverty here with that in developed countries , " he said . the study considered people who earned less than 40 percent of their nation 's average income as poor and people with 60 percent as in danger of falling into poverty . surprise expenses make the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines for hand-outs in munich this past october unexpected expenses present some of the biggest problems for over half of germany 's borderline poor .

also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .

in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .

on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .

but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .
the " rebels " were publicly hanged . " we want young people who visit to go away with not only a picture of the holocaust as the greatest tragedy of humanity , but also of what was positive - the heroism of the victims , and their mutual support and solidarity , " cywinski said . dw staff / afp -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .
the " rebels " were publicly hanged . " we want young people who visit to go away with not only a picture of the holocaust as the greatest tragedy of humanity , but also of what was positive - the heroism of the victims , and their mutual support and solidarity , " cywinski said . dw staff / afp -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .

they 're also gobbling them up out of a love for german culture .
the market 's big , and getting bigger each season . when halla roberts glances over the well-stocked shelves of her local supermarket in washington , her eyes always stop when she spots a certain german christmas cookie . " i love lebkuchen , " said the 27-year-old web designer , placing a bag of the traditional christmas spice cookies in her shopping cart . lebkuchen , along with crispy cinnamon and almond-flavored spekulatius , and stollen , a raisin yeast-bread that sometimes has other dried fruit , nuts or a strip of marzipan in the center , have become christmas fixtures in the us . roberts is not alone in her love of lebkuchen .
an increasing number of americans buy german christmas specialties and other food items from germany . " demand in the us for german foods has risen enormously over the past five to 10 years , " said arnim von friedeburg of the german agricultural marketing board in north america , known as the cma . from fatty to trendy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original dresden stollen is shipped all the way to alaska and japan although german grocery foods sometimes had a bad reputation in the us because they were considered fatty and unhealthy , the volume of german consumer products sold in the us , including christmas specialties , is projected to grow this year by eight to 13 percent , the cma said . in a cma survey of buyers of german foods , more than half said they wanted to buy german christmas specialties in the near future . rodman 's gourmet stores , a washington-based grocery , offers a large selection of international foods , including imports from germany .

in each of his three warehouses there is a special section for german products to meet the huge demand . the christmas goodies from germany are especially popular with rodman 's customers , he said , adding that the store wants to further broaden its range of german products .
this year , for the first time , rodman 's is offering chocolate pfeffernuesse . sugarplum fairies hildegard fehr is also pleased about americans ' high level of interest in german specialties .

the 74-year-old said she sells a lot to americans leading up to the year-end holidays , and requests continue even after christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german christmas traditions is part of the fun !
" our american customers simply ca n't understand why we do n't sell stollen after christmas , ' fehr said . other market successes beyond cookies , cakes and chocolates are german advent calendars , incense burners and wooden pyramids with fan blades on top that rotate when their candles are lit . von friedeburg said he believes the reason for americans ' growing interest in german food is part of a broader interest in german culture . many of today 's 25-year-olds have ancestors with german roots , sparking an interest in germany , he said .

of 1,000 consumers surveyed , 16 percent said that foods imported from germany are high quality , a further 15.5 percent said they buy german foods because they taste good and 7 percent said they were convinced german food is healthy . lebkuchen -lover roberts initially had to be convinced that there was more to german foods than just well-known dishes like sauerkraut and sauerbraten .
she said she only found out recently that lebkuchen came from germany . roberts has now gotten so enthusiastic over german christmas goodies that it has inspired her to try her hand at baking a stolen using a german recipe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de saint nicholas : the bearded legend while germany 's children are looking into the shoes they put out before going to bed and spent the night hoping to find them filled with candy in the morning , kids in other countries might be scared they 'll get the whip .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .

french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .

but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .

" unemployment and the lack of a proper educational qualification are the main factors , " radermacher said while presenting the survey called " life in europe , " which focused on poverty . more than 40 percent of those without jobs and a quarter of those without proper qualifications are threatened by poverty compared to only 5 percent of those who are employed , he said . radermacher added , however , that the definition of " poor " is based on european standards .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .
they have had a list of aliases , provided by spanish police , of el-masri 's likely kidnappers since the end of 2005 .
it took german prosecutors months , however , to make further enquires , the paper said . tortured in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri also gave a statement during the german inquiry according to el-masri , cia -lrb- the us secret service -rrb- agents believed he was a terrorist and abducted him in macedonia at the end of december 2003 .
he said he was taken to afghanistan , where he was repeatedly tortured during interrogations before being released in albania in may 2004 . el-masri has sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trial could compromise us security by disclosing secret information , but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . el-masri recently appealed that decision and has demanded an apology from the cia as well as an explanation for his abduction . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . last week , august hanning , the former head of the german foreign intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- said his agency played no part in el-masri 's kidnapping . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : 11 eu countries knew of secret cia prisons germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report .

he said it is more important to teach children and their parents how to deal with the media . double standard for games ? meanwhile , green party politicians warned that banning violent computer games could set up a double standard when compared with other entertainment media . " whoever considers banning games has to also use the same criteria when considering film and books , " volker beck , the head of the green parliamentary party , told the online newspaper netzeitung .
in addition , he said he considers a legally punishable ban on so-called " killer games " to be " short sighted and irrelevant . " it is more important for parents and guardians of the children to take responsibility for what media the minors in their care are consuming , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 06.12.2006 iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad has called the holocaust " a myth " a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .
iran is behind the meeting , which is expected to be a platform for holocaust deniers . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has dismissed the holocaust as a myth . and last january , the iranian government announced it would hold a conference on the holocaust .
it said it intended to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler and the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir , both of whom are holocaust deniers . back in january , western politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the plan - although it was debated at the time whether the conference would actually take place , and what it was intended to provoke .
now , however , it seems clear that it will take place after all . questioning the gas chambers iran 's foreign ministry has invited scholars from 30 countries to discuss questions such as the scale of the holocaust , and whether or not the nazis really used gas chambers to kill jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british holocaust denier david irving lost his case deputy foreign minister manouchehr mohammadi said 67 researchers from countries including britain , germany and france would take part in the two-day meeting starting on monday , according to wednesday 's jomhuri-ye eslami newspaper . not in attendance will be british historian david irving .
he was on the original invitation list , but is currently serving a three-year jail term in austria for holocaust denial . ahmadinejad : holocaust open to question ahmadinejad caused international outrage last year when he said the holocaust - in which six million jews were killed by the nazis - was a myth .
he has not repeated that remark but has said the holocaust is open to question . foreign minister mohammadi said the aim of the conference , dubbed " holocaust , world prospect , " was to give scholars a chance to discuss the issue freely . holocaust denial is a crime in germany and austria when the conference plans were firsted announced in january , german green party chief reinhard bütikofer called it further evidence that ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . " legal consequences ?
but speaking in an interview with german magazine der spiegel earlier this year , gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party , warned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .
holocaust denial is a criminal offence in germany . but according to gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight , " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if -lrb- anyone -rrb- speaks there they will not be punished .

as the holidays draw near , us americans are ga-ga about yummy german christmas goodies .
they 're also gobbling them up out of a love for german culture .
the market 's big , and getting bigger each season . when halla roberts glances over the well-stocked shelves of her local supermarket in washington , her eyes always stop when she spots a certain german christmas cookie . " i love lebkuchen , " said the 27-year-old web designer , placing a bag of the traditional christmas spice cookies in her shopping cart . lebkuchen , along with crispy cinnamon and almond-flavored spekulatius , and stollen , a raisin yeast-bread that sometimes has other dried fruit , nuts or a strip of marzipan in the center , have become christmas fixtures in the us . roberts is not alone in her love of lebkuchen .
an increasing number of americans buy german christmas specialties and other food items from germany . " demand in the us for german foods has risen enormously over the past five to 10 years , " said arnim von friedeburg of the german agricultural marketing board in north america , known as the cma . from fatty to trendy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original dresden stollen is shipped all the way to alaska and japan although german grocery foods sometimes had a bad reputation in the us because they were considered fatty and unhealthy , the volume of german consumer products sold in the us , including christmas specialties , is projected to grow this year by eight to 13 percent , the cma said . in a cma survey of buyers of german foods , more than half said they wanted to buy german christmas specialties in the near future . rodman 's gourmet stores , a washington-based grocery , offers a large selection of international foods , including imports from germany .
it has long carried items like pfeffernuesse -lrb- spicy cookies covered in powered suger -rrb- and spekulatius to satisfy the american taste for traditional german christmas cookies . roy rodman , top manager at the store , said the number of german products offered at rodman 's has grown 10-fold in the last 15 years .
in each of his three warehouses there is a special section for german products to meet the huge demand . the christmas goodies from germany are especially popular with rodman 's customers , he said , adding that the store wants to further broaden its range of german products .
this year , for the first time , rodman 's is offering chocolate pfeffernuesse . sugarplum fairies hildegard fehr is also pleased about americans ' high level of interest in german specialties .
a native of austria , fehr has sold products from germany for 42 years in her small delicatessen near the white house .
the 74-year-old said she sells a lot to americans leading up to the year-end holidays , and requests continue even after christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german christmas traditions is part of the fun !
" our american customers simply ca n't understand why we do n't sell stollen after christmas , ' fehr said . other market successes beyond cookies , cakes and chocolates are german advent calendars , incense burners and wooden pyramids with fan blades on top that rotate when their candles are lit . von friedeburg said he believes the reason for americans ' growing interest in german food is part of a broader interest in german culture . many of today 's 25-year-olds have ancestors with german roots , sparking an interest in germany , he said .
meanwhile , prejudices against german culture held by previous generations is also fading . healthy fare the cma 's 2006 marketing research on german food and drinks shed further light on the trend .
of 1,000 consumers surveyed , 16 percent said that foods imported from germany are high quality , a further 15.5 percent said they buy german foods because they taste good and 7 percent said they were convinced german food is healthy . lebkuchen -lover roberts initially had to be convinced that there was more to german foods than just well-known dishes like sauerkraut and sauerbraten .
she said she only found out recently that lebkuchen came from germany . roberts has now gotten so enthusiastic over german christmas goodies that it has inspired her to try her hand at baking a stolen using a german recipe . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de saint nicholas : the bearded legend while germany 's children are looking into the shoes they put out before going to bed and spent the night hoping to find them filled with candy in the morning , kids in other countries might be scared they 'll get the whip .

5 and spanks young women on the behind .
and he whacks them hard , using a big curved cow-horn . borkum boasts six of these such red-nosed " klaases " who sport huge sheepskins on their backs and have cow-tails .
they drink schnapps with the local men and dance on the bar tables till late in the night and they give gifts to the children . this old whaling custom has very little to do with the celebrated fourth-century bishop from asia minor , but it is how the islanders celebrate st. nicholas day .
in what seems to outsiders to be no more than an excuse for drunken debauchery , the night is reputed for being great fun and the young islanders start their preparations months in advance . a humble and generous bishop becomes a legend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas , a fourth-century bishop from asia minor more traditionally , however , nicholas is known as a gaunt bishop from the ancient city of myra , now in turkey .
he apparently became a bishop at the age of 19 and gave away his inheritance to the poor .
his humility and generosity gave rise to a wealth of legends . one story tells of nicholas coaxing grain intended for the emperor from some sailors in the local port to feed the poor during a famine .
when the cargo was unloaded in byzantium , not a single grain was said to be missing . another time , he bailed out an impoverished father whose daughters could not marry because he had no dowry for them .
three nights running , nicholas threw gold nuggets into the young women 's bedroom and thus the wedding bells were able to toll . over time , the gold nuggets were transformed into golden apples , whereas the kaiser 's grain became tasty foodstuffs and candy . nicholas ' punishing helper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together they mete out praise and punishment but st. nicholas did n't run a one-man operation .
the good , generous nicholas was said to be accompanied by an angry side-kick whose task it is to mete out punishment to mischievous children .
in germany , this devilish being goes as knecht ruprecht , in switzerland his name is smutzli , in austria he is known as krampli and in holland he is zwarte piet , the black peter . just as their names differ , so do their appearances and their use of rods , whips and rattling chains .
however , their common role , which arose in the middle ages , was customarily to frighten children into good behavior with threats of being whipped , slit open or gobbled up . according to the dutch , sinterklaas , wearing his bishop 's garb , and zwarte piet in his devil 's dress , live in spain most of the year , monitoring the children from afar .
but , once a year in november , they set anchor in holland and their arrival is broadcast on television and the duo travels across the netherlands , giving out praise and punishment . well-behaved dutch children receive their annual gifts on dec .
6 , instead of dec .
25 .
naughty children , however , get the rod - with zwarte piet scooping up the worst of the worst into his sack and taking them all the way back to spain . legends all rolled into one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus as he is known today with his helpers the reindeers in finland , nicholas goes by joulupukki .
he is neither holy nor devilish but pretty pagan .
he lives in lapland and distributes gifts on dec .
6 , which are reminiscent of pagan times .
a descendent of this 900-year-old man has been trying to prove his existence for years .
in his version of the st. nick story , the sack and the rod are symbols of male fertility . saint nicholas , black pete and santa claus have merged into one happy entity , as have the myths and legends , culminating in a cheery christmas celebration at the end of the year .
the christian reformers of the middle ages had their part in this metamorphosis and people transposed their pagan customs to christmas . whatever the tradition today 's children believe , the hope that nicholas has paid them an overnight visit leaving them gifts and candy has become the norm .
whether he put them in their clean shoes , threw them through the window or sneaked them into their stockings hanging above the fireplace is irrelevant .
santa claus can also wear a bishop 's hat , a long beard or daddy 's bathrobe for all they care . the ubiquitous , super-cuddly , white-bearded santa claus who has become so well-loved among children across the world is a recent invention .
he appeared on the world-stage during a 1930s coca-cola advertising campaign .
his permanent grin has not been wiped off since . matthias lemme -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin begging for more santas germany 's unemployment rates are falling , but the german capital is experiencing a serious shortage of santa clauses this year .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .

french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .

but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 06.12.2006 iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad has called the holocaust " a myth " a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .
iran is behind the meeting , which is expected to be a platform for holocaust deniers . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has dismissed the holocaust as a myth . and last january , the iranian government announced it would hold a conference on the holocaust .
it said it intended to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler and the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir , both of whom are holocaust deniers . back in january , western politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the plan - although it was debated at the time whether the conference would actually take place , and what it was intended to provoke .
now , however , it seems clear that it will take place after all . questioning the gas chambers iran 's foreign ministry has invited scholars from 30 countries to discuss questions such as the scale of the holocaust , and whether or not the nazis really used gas chambers to kill jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british holocaust denier david irving lost his case deputy foreign minister manouchehr mohammadi said 67 researchers from countries including britain , germany and france would take part in the two-day meeting starting on monday , according to wednesday 's jomhuri-ye eslami newspaper . not in attendance will be british historian david irving .
he was on the original invitation list , but is currently serving a three-year jail term in austria for holocaust denial . ahmadinejad : holocaust open to question ahmadinejad caused international outrage last year when he said the holocaust - in which six million jews were killed by the nazis - was a myth .
he has not repeated that remark but has said the holocaust is open to question . foreign minister mohammadi said the aim of the conference , dubbed " holocaust , world prospect , " was to give scholars a chance to discuss the issue freely . holocaust denial is a crime in germany and austria when the conference plans were firsted announced in january , german green party chief reinhard bütikofer called it further evidence that ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . " legal consequences ?

iran is behind the meeting , which is expected to be a platform for holocaust deniers . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has dismissed the holocaust as a myth . and last january , the iranian government announced it would hold a conference on the holocaust .
it said it intended to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler and the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir , both of whom are holocaust deniers . back in january , western politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the plan - although it was debated at the time whether the conference would actually take place , and what it was intended to provoke .
now , however , it seems clear that it will take place after all . questioning the gas chambers iran 's foreign ministry has invited scholars from 30 countries to discuss questions such as the scale of the holocaust , and whether or not the nazis really used gas chambers to kill jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british holocaust denier david irving lost his case deputy foreign minister manouchehr mohammadi said 67 researchers from countries including britain , germany and france would take part in the two-day meeting starting on monday , according to wednesday 's jomhuri-ye eslami newspaper . not in attendance will be british historian david irving .
he was on the original invitation list , but is currently serving a three-year jail term in austria for holocaust denial . ahmadinejad : holocaust open to question ahmadinejad caused international outrage last year when he said the holocaust - in which six million jews were killed by the nazis - was a myth .
he has not repeated that remark but has said the holocaust is open to question . foreign minister mohammadi said the aim of the conference , dubbed " holocaust , world prospect , " was to give scholars a chance to discuss the issue freely . holocaust denial is a crime in germany and austria when the conference plans were firsted announced in january , german green party chief reinhard bütikofer called it further evidence that ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . " legal consequences ?
but speaking in an interview with german magazine der spiegel earlier this year , gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party , warned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .
holocaust denial is a criminal offence in germany . but according to gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight , " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if -lrb- anyone -rrb- speaks there they will not be punished .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .
they have had a list of aliases , provided by spanish police , of el-masri 's likely kidnappers since the end of 2005 .
it took german prosecutors months , however , to make further enquires , the paper said . tortured in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri also gave a statement during the german inquiry according to el-masri , cia -lrb- the us secret service -rrb- agents believed he was a terrorist and abducted him in macedonia at the end of december 2003 .
he said he was taken to afghanistan , where he was repeatedly tortured during interrogations before being released in albania in may 2004 . el-masri has sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trial could compromise us security by disclosing secret information , but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . el-masri recently appealed that decision and has demanded an apology from the cia as well as an explanation for his abduction . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . last week , august hanning , the former head of the german foreign intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- said his agency played no part in el-masri 's kidnapping . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : 11 eu countries knew of secret cia prisons germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .
other companies have come out of such a situation stronger , enders noted .
and he noted that aside from airbus , some other units -lrb- defense , aerospace -rrb- are successful . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro aerospace industry sighs with relief as airbus oks a350 european plane maker airbus is to develop its a350 passenger jet , parent company eads announced late friday , ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the european aerospace industry .
-lrb- 02.12.2006 -rrb- airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .
but the financing of the a350 could exacerbate tensions between the us and the eu .

6 . recent incidents of school violence over the past several weeks have prompted calls for a ban on sales of violent computer games to minors . the states of bavaria and lower saxony have said they would like to ban so-called " killer games " with an initiative in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . lower saxony supports bavaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians called for banning violent games bavaria 's interior minister , the christian social union member günther beckstein , said he wants make the creation , sale and use of computer games that glorify violence punishable by law . uwe schünemann , lower saxony 's interior minister and christian democrat , said he supported the idea .

" unemployment and the lack of a proper educational qualification are the main factors , " radermacher said while presenting the survey called " life in europe , " which focused on poverty . more than 40 percent of those without jobs and a quarter of those without proper qualifications are threatened by poverty compared to only 5 percent of those who are employed , he said . radermacher added , however , that the definition of " poor " is based on european standards . " you can not compare poverty here with that in developed countries , " he said . the study considered people who earned less than 40 percent of their nation 's average income as poor and people with 60 percent as in danger of falling into poverty . surprise expenses make the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines for hand-outs in munich this past october unexpected expenses present some of the biggest problems for over half of germany 's borderline poor .
unanticipated trips to the dentist , car or home repairs , or an accident - all of these can turn into a major drama for the poor or nearly poor . " twenty-two percent of the poor said they could not go to the doctor or dentist for financial reasons , compared to 7 percent of the rest of the population , " rademacher said . without state funding such as unemployment benefits , social welfare , housing subsidies and family benefits , the report said nearly one-fourth of the german population would be at risk of becoming poor . the survey compared living conditions in the 25 members of the european union , norway and iceland based on information compiled from 2004 . in germany people are considered in danger of falling into poverty if they have less than 856 euros -lrb- $ 1,112 -rrb- at their disposal each month . werner hesse , president of the german association of welfare organizations , said social workers are seeing alarming developments . " some people can not even buy school materials or pack lunches for their children because they do n't have the money , " he said . many retirees are also poor .
walter hirrlinger , president of the the vdk social association , an association that represents the interests of the physically challenged , seniors and patients , told the chemnitzer freie presse newspaper that " more than 2 million retirees had to live on less than 650 euros .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .
the " rebels " were publicly hanged . " we want young people who visit to go away with not only a picture of the holocaust as the greatest tragedy of humanity , but also of what was positive - the heroism of the victims , and their mutual support and solidarity , " cywinski said . dw staff / afp -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .
other companies have come out of such a situation stronger , enders noted .
and he noted that aside from airbus , some other units -lrb- defense , aerospace -rrb- are successful . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro aerospace industry sighs with relief as airbus oks a350 european plane maker airbus is to develop its a350 passenger jet , parent company eads announced late friday , ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the european aerospace industry .

iran is behind the meeting , which is expected to be a platform for holocaust deniers . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has dismissed the holocaust as a myth . and last january , the iranian government announced it would hold a conference on the holocaust .
it said it intended to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler and the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir , both of whom are holocaust deniers . back in january , western politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the plan - although it was debated at the time whether the conference would actually take place , and what it was intended to provoke .

he has not repeated that remark but has said the holocaust is open to question . foreign minister mohammadi said the aim of the conference , dubbed " holocaust , world prospect , " was to give scholars a chance to discuss the issue freely . holocaust denial is a crime in germany and austria when the conference plans were firsted announced in january , german green party chief reinhard bütikofer called it further evidence that ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . " legal consequences ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive berliners celebrate new shopping hours singing : the price merkel pays for the chancellery society -pipe- 06.12.2006 saint nicholas : the bearded legend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saint nicholas with staff and mitre while germany 's children are looking into the shoes they put out before going to bed and spent the night hoping to find them filled with candy in the morning , kids in other countries might be scared they 'll get the whip . the island of borkum has an unusual way of celebrating the feast of st. nicholas . saint nicholas , known as klaasohm in the regional low german dialect , roams the island in the night of dec .
5 and spanks young women on the behind .
and he whacks them hard , using a big curved cow-horn . borkum boasts six of these such red-nosed " klaases " who sport huge sheepskins on their backs and have cow-tails .
they drink schnapps with the local men and dance on the bar tables till late in the night and they give gifts to the children . this old whaling custom has very little to do with the celebrated fourth-century bishop from asia minor , but it is how the islanders celebrate st. nicholas day .
in what seems to outsiders to be no more than an excuse for drunken debauchery , the night is reputed for being great fun and the young islanders start their preparations months in advance . a humble and generous bishop becomes a legend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas , a fourth-century bishop from asia minor more traditionally , however , nicholas is known as a gaunt bishop from the ancient city of myra , now in turkey .
he apparently became a bishop at the age of 19 and gave away his inheritance to the poor .
his humility and generosity gave rise to a wealth of legends . one story tells of nicholas coaxing grain intended for the emperor from some sailors in the local port to feed the poor during a famine .
when the cargo was unloaded in byzantium , not a single grain was said to be missing . another time , he bailed out an impoverished father whose daughters could not marry because he had no dowry for them .
three nights running , nicholas threw gold nuggets into the young women 's bedroom and thus the wedding bells were able to toll . over time , the gold nuggets were transformed into golden apples , whereas the kaiser 's grain became tasty foodstuffs and candy . nicholas ' punishing helper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together they mete out praise and punishment but st. nicholas did n't run a one-man operation .
the good , generous nicholas was said to be accompanied by an angry side-kick whose task it is to mete out punishment to mischievous children .
in germany , this devilish being goes as knecht ruprecht , in switzerland his name is smutzli , in austria he is known as krampli and in holland he is zwarte piet , the black peter . just as their names differ , so do their appearances and their use of rods , whips and rattling chains .
however , their common role , which arose in the middle ages , was customarily to frighten children into good behavior with threats of being whipped , slit open or gobbled up . according to the dutch , sinterklaas , wearing his bishop 's garb , and zwarte piet in his devil 's dress , live in spain most of the year , monitoring the children from afar .
but , once a year in november , they set anchor in holland and their arrival is broadcast on television and the duo travels across the netherlands , giving out praise and punishment . well-behaved dutch children receive their annual gifts on dec .

barcelona got off to the perfect start in the 13th minute , with ronaldinho firing a low free-kick under the bremen wall - whose members all jumped in anticipation of a high kick - and past goalkeeper tim wiese . eidur gudjohnsen doubled barca 's lead five minutes later , guiding home ludovic giuly 's cross , leaving bremen with the nearly-impossible task of clawing their way back on onto the scoreboard . the closest the germans , who only needed a tie to advance , came to closing the gap , was in the second half when daniel jensen beat barca keeper victor valdes only to be denied by the bar on a deflected cross . barca win a blow for bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deco and aaron hunt battle for the ball the result sees barca finish second in the group , two points behind chelsea , who secured top spot with a 2-0 defeat of levski sofia thanks to clinical finish from ukrainian striker andriy shevchenko and a fine strike from substitute shaun wright-phillips . bremen will now have to be satisfied with a place in the uefa cup . " we never got into the game in the way we had planned , " bremen coach thomas schaaf said after the match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 06.12.2006 for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads failed to fly high in 2006 - due especially to problems at its airbus unit the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .
especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .
other companies have come out of such a situation stronger , enders noted .
and he noted that aside from airbus , some other units -lrb- defense , aerospace -rrb- are successful . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro aerospace industry sighs with relief as airbus oks a350 european plane maker airbus is to develop its a350 passenger jet , parent company eads announced late friday , ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the european aerospace industry .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 06.12.2006 iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad has called the holocaust " a myth " a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .
iran is behind the meeting , which is expected to be a platform for holocaust deniers . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has dismissed the holocaust as a myth . and last january , the iranian government announced it would hold a conference on the holocaust .
it said it intended to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler and the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir , both of whom are holocaust deniers . back in january , western politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the plan - although it was debated at the time whether the conference would actually take place , and what it was intended to provoke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive berliners celebrate new shopping hours singing : the price merkel pays for the chancellery society -pipe- 06.12.2006 saint nicholas : the bearded legend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saint nicholas with staff and mitre while germany 's children are looking into the shoes they put out before going to bed and spent the night hoping to find them filled with candy in the morning , kids in other countries might be scared they 'll get the whip . the island of borkum has an unusual way of celebrating the feast of st. nicholas . saint nicholas , known as klaasohm in the regional low german dialect , roams the island in the night of dec .
5 and spanks young women on the behind .
and he whacks them hard , using a big curved cow-horn . borkum boasts six of these such red-nosed " klaases " who sport huge sheepskins on their backs and have cow-tails .
they drink schnapps with the local men and dance on the bar tables till late in the night and they give gifts to the children . this old whaling custom has very little to do with the celebrated fourth-century bishop from asia minor , but it is how the islanders celebrate st. nicholas day .
in what seems to outsiders to be no more than an excuse for drunken debauchery , the night is reputed for being great fun and the young islanders start their preparations months in advance . a humble and generous bishop becomes a legend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas , a fourth-century bishop from asia minor more traditionally , however , nicholas is known as a gaunt bishop from the ancient city of myra , now in turkey .
he apparently became a bishop at the age of 19 and gave away his inheritance to the poor .
his humility and generosity gave rise to a wealth of legends . one story tells of nicholas coaxing grain intended for the emperor from some sailors in the local port to feed the poor during a famine .
when the cargo was unloaded in byzantium , not a single grain was said to be missing . another time , he bailed out an impoverished father whose daughters could not marry because he had no dowry for them .
three nights running , nicholas threw gold nuggets into the young women 's bedroom and thus the wedding bells were able to toll . over time , the gold nuggets were transformed into golden apples , whereas the kaiser 's grain became tasty foodstuffs and candy . nicholas ' punishing helper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together they mete out praise and punishment but st. nicholas did n't run a one-man operation .
the good , generous nicholas was said to be accompanied by an angry side-kick whose task it is to mete out punishment to mischievous children .
in germany , this devilish being goes as knecht ruprecht , in switzerland his name is smutzli , in austria he is known as krampli and in holland he is zwarte piet , the black peter . just as their names differ , so do their appearances and their use of rods , whips and rattling chains .
however , their common role , which arose in the middle ages , was customarily to frighten children into good behavior with threats of being whipped , slit open or gobbled up . according to the dutch , sinterklaas , wearing his bishop 's garb , and zwarte piet in his devil 's dress , live in spain most of the year , monitoring the children from afar .
but , once a year in november , they set anchor in holland and their arrival is broadcast on television and the duo travels across the netherlands , giving out praise and punishment . well-behaved dutch children receive their annual gifts on dec .
6 , instead of dec .
25 .
naughty children , however , get the rod - with zwarte piet scooping up the worst of the worst into his sack and taking them all the way back to spain . legends all rolled into one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus as he is known today with his helpers the reindeers in finland , nicholas goes by joulupukki .
he is neither holy nor devilish but pretty pagan .
he lives in lapland and distributes gifts on dec .
6 , which are reminiscent of pagan times .
a descendent of this 900-year-old man has been trying to prove his existence for years .
in his version of the st. nick story , the sack and the rod are symbols of male fertility . saint nicholas , black pete and santa claus have merged into one happy entity , as have the myths and legends , culminating in a cheery christmas celebration at the end of the year .

5 and spanks young women on the behind .
and he whacks them hard , using a big curved cow-horn . borkum boasts six of these such red-nosed " klaases " who sport huge sheepskins on their backs and have cow-tails .
they drink schnapps with the local men and dance on the bar tables till late in the night and they give gifts to the children . this old whaling custom has very little to do with the celebrated fourth-century bishop from asia minor , but it is how the islanders celebrate st. nicholas day .
in what seems to outsiders to be no more than an excuse for drunken debauchery , the night is reputed for being great fun and the young islanders start their preparations months in advance . a humble and generous bishop becomes a legend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas , a fourth-century bishop from asia minor more traditionally , however , nicholas is known as a gaunt bishop from the ancient city of myra , now in turkey .
he apparently became a bishop at the age of 19 and gave away his inheritance to the poor .
his humility and generosity gave rise to a wealth of legends . one story tells of nicholas coaxing grain intended for the emperor from some sailors in the local port to feed the poor during a famine .
when the cargo was unloaded in byzantium , not a single grain was said to be missing . another time , he bailed out an impoverished father whose daughters could not marry because he had no dowry for them .
three nights running , nicholas threw gold nuggets into the young women 's bedroom and thus the wedding bells were able to toll . over time , the gold nuggets were transformed into golden apples , whereas the kaiser 's grain became tasty foodstuffs and candy . nicholas ' punishing helper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together they mete out praise and punishment but st. nicholas did n't run a one-man operation .
the good , generous nicholas was said to be accompanied by an angry side-kick whose task it is to mete out punishment to mischievous children .
in germany , this devilish being goes as knecht ruprecht , in switzerland his name is smutzli , in austria he is known as krampli and in holland he is zwarte piet , the black peter . just as their names differ , so do their appearances and their use of rods , whips and rattling chains .

the news came just two weeks after a firearms fanatic shot and wounded 37 people at a school in the western german town of emsdetten before committing suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman of the emsdetten massacre had this photo on his web site authorities searched students entering the schools in the southwestern town of offenburg near the french border , looking for weapons and dispatched police officers to guard the buildings . officers in cruisers and helicopters launched a manhunt for the missing pupil , who is considered a loner and vanished on monday .

6 . recent incidents of school violence over the past several weeks have prompted calls for a ban on sales of violent computer games to minors . the states of bavaria and lower saxony have said they would like to ban so-called " killer games " with an initiative in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . lower saxony supports bavaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians called for banning violent games bavaria 's interior minister , the christian social union member günther beckstein , said he wants make the creation , sale and use of computer games that glorify violence punishable by law . uwe schünemann , lower saxony 's interior minister and christian democrat , said he supported the idea .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .
they have had a list of aliases , provided by spanish police , of el-masri 's likely kidnappers since the end of 2005 .
it took german prosecutors months , however , to make further enquires , the paper said . tortured in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri also gave a statement during the german inquiry according to el-masri , cia -lrb- the us secret service -rrb- agents believed he was a terrorist and abducted him in macedonia at the end of december 2003 .
he said he was taken to afghanistan , where he was repeatedly tortured during interrogations before being released in albania in may 2004 . el-masri has sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trial could compromise us security by disclosing secret information , but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . el-masri recently appealed that decision and has demanded an apology from the cia as well as an explanation for his abduction . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . last week , august hanning , the former head of the german foreign intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- said his agency played no part in el-masri 's kidnapping . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : 11 eu countries knew of secret cia prisons germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .
the " rebels " were publicly hanged . " we want young people who visit to go away with not only a picture of the holocaust as the greatest tragedy of humanity , but also of what was positive - the heroism of the victims , and their mutual support and solidarity , " cywinski said . dw staff / afp -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 06.12.2006 for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads failed to fly high in 2006 - due especially to problems at its airbus unit the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .
especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .
other companies have come out of such a situation stronger , enders noted .
and he noted that aside from airbus , some other units -lrb- defense , aerospace -rrb- are successful . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro aerospace industry sighs with relief as airbus oks a350 european plane maker airbus is to develop its a350 passenger jet , parent company eads announced late friday , ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the european aerospace industry .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive berliners celebrate new shopping hours singing : the price merkel pays for the chancellery society -pipe- 06.12.2006 saint nicholas : the bearded legend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saint nicholas with staff and mitre while germany 's children are looking into the shoes they put out before going to bed and spent the night hoping to find them filled with candy in the morning , kids in other countries might be scared they 'll get the whip . the island of borkum has an unusual way of celebrating the feast of st. nicholas . saint nicholas , known as klaasohm in the regional low german dialect , roams the island in the night of dec .
5 and spanks young women on the behind .
and he whacks them hard , using a big curved cow-horn . borkum boasts six of these such red-nosed " klaases " who sport huge sheepskins on their backs and have cow-tails .
they drink schnapps with the local men and dance on the bar tables till late in the night and they give gifts to the children . this old whaling custom has very little to do with the celebrated fourth-century bishop from asia minor , but it is how the islanders celebrate st. nicholas day .
in what seems to outsiders to be no more than an excuse for drunken debauchery , the night is reputed for being great fun and the young islanders start their preparations months in advance . a humble and generous bishop becomes a legend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas , a fourth-century bishop from asia minor more traditionally , however , nicholas is known as a gaunt bishop from the ancient city of myra , now in turkey .
he apparently became a bishop at the age of 19 and gave away his inheritance to the poor .
his humility and generosity gave rise to a wealth of legends . one story tells of nicholas coaxing grain intended for the emperor from some sailors in the local port to feed the poor during a famine .
when the cargo was unloaded in byzantium , not a single grain was said to be missing . another time , he bailed out an impoverished father whose daughters could not marry because he had no dowry for them .
three nights running , nicholas threw gold nuggets into the young women 's bedroom and thus the wedding bells were able to toll . over time , the gold nuggets were transformed into golden apples , whereas the kaiser 's grain became tasty foodstuffs and candy . nicholas ' punishing helper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together they mete out praise and punishment but st. nicholas did n't run a one-man operation .
the good , generous nicholas was said to be accompanied by an angry side-kick whose task it is to mete out punishment to mischievous children .
in germany , this devilish being goes as knecht ruprecht , in switzerland his name is smutzli , in austria he is known as krampli and in holland he is zwarte piet , the black peter . just as their names differ , so do their appearances and their use of rods , whips and rattling chains .
however , their common role , which arose in the middle ages , was customarily to frighten children into good behavior with threats of being whipped , slit open or gobbled up . according to the dutch , sinterklaas , wearing his bishop 's garb , and zwarte piet in his devil 's dress , live in spain most of the year , monitoring the children from afar .
but , once a year in november , they set anchor in holland and their arrival is broadcast on television and the duo travels across the netherlands , giving out praise and punishment . well-behaved dutch children receive their annual gifts on dec .
6 , instead of dec .
25 .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .
they have had a list of aliases , provided by spanish police , of el-masri 's likely kidnappers since the end of 2005 .

" i love lebkuchen , " said the 27-year-old web designer , placing a bag of the traditional christmas spice cookies in her shopping cart . lebkuchen , along with crispy cinnamon and almond-flavored spekulatius , and stollen , a raisin yeast-bread that sometimes has other dried fruit , nuts or a strip of marzipan in the center , have become christmas fixtures in the us . roberts is not alone in her love of lebkuchen .
an increasing number of americans buy german christmas specialties and other food items from germany . " demand in the us for german foods has risen enormously over the past five to 10 years , " said arnim von friedeburg of the german agricultural marketing board in north america , known as the cma . from fatty to trendy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : original dresden stollen is shipped all the way to alaska and japan although german grocery foods sometimes had a bad reputation in the us because they were considered fatty and unhealthy , the volume of german consumer products sold in the us , including christmas specialties , is projected to grow this year by eight to 13 percent , the cma said . in a cma survey of buyers of german foods , more than half said they wanted to buy german christmas specialties in the near future . rodman 's gourmet stores , a washington-based grocery , offers a large selection of international foods , including imports from germany .

in each of his three warehouses there is a special section for german products to meet the huge demand . the christmas goodies from germany are especially popular with rodman 's customers , he said , adding that the store wants to further broaden its range of german products .
this year , for the first time , rodman 's is offering chocolate pfeffernuesse . sugarplum fairies hildegard fehr is also pleased about americans ' high level of interest in german specialties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 06.12.2006 plans to modernize auschwitz museum approved großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urgent renovations are needed to save the museum premises at auschwitz the museum housed in the original prison barracks at auschwitz , the former nazi extermination camp in southern poland , is to undergo urgent renovation , the museum 's new director , piotr cywinski , announced on wednesday . the huge volume of traffic to the site that has served as memorial for 51 years meant that renovation was long overdue .
" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .
other companies have come out of such a situation stronger , enders noted .
and he noted that aside from airbus , some other units -lrb- defense , aerospace -rrb- are successful . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro aerospace industry sighs with relief as airbus oks a350 european plane maker airbus is to develop its a350 passenger jet , parent company eads announced late friday , ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the european aerospace industry .
-lrb- 02.12.2006 -rrb- airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .

the news came just two weeks after a firearms fanatic shot and wounded 37 people at a school in the western german town of emsdetten before committing suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman of the emsdetten massacre had this photo on his web site authorities searched students entering the schools in the southwestern town of offenburg near the french border , looking for weapons and dispatched police officers to guard the buildings . officers in cruisers and helicopters launched a manhunt for the missing pupil , who is considered a loner and vanished on monday .
a hotline was set up for concerned parents , teachers and students . planned bloodbath ? authorities sent out a warning to all the schools in the state of baden-württemberg on tuesday after two high school students playing the game " counter strike " on the internet encountered a third person who , during an online chat , announced there would be a bloodbath at his school on dec .
6 . recent incidents of school violence over the past several weeks have prompted calls for a ban on sales of violent computer games to minors . the states of bavaria and lower saxony have said they would like to ban so-called " killer games " with an initiative in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . lower saxony supports bavaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians called for banning violent games bavaria 's interior minister , the christian social union member günther beckstein , said he wants make the creation , sale and use of computer games that glorify violence punishable by law . uwe schünemann , lower saxony 's interior minister and christian democrat , said he supported the idea .
his ministry was working on a plan that would function together with bavaria 's , he said . " our goal is to have a bundesrat initiative by early 2007 , " schünemann said . according to beckstein 's suggestions , the sale , purchase and use of games that fail to respect human life would be punishable by up to a year of prison . but a speaker for the bavarian ministry , rainer riedl , said there needs to be some differentiation built in to the concept . " someone who designs and sells violent computer games for profit should be treated differently than someone who borrowed a game from a friend , " riedl said . plan meets opposition but the plan has met with criticism from politicians in the social democratic party , the junior partner in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition , and the opposition green party .
the plan is superficial and wo n't help , they say . " many politicians ca n't think of anything better to do in reaction to cases like emsdetten , " spd interior expert dieter wiefelspütz told the daily die welt newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning games is not an effective reaction to school shootings , wiefelspütz said some spd politicians agreed that a ban would make sense in the case of some games .
but ralf stegner , the interior minister from the state of schleswig-holstein , said a ban " only appears to be the safest way to protect children and teenagers . "
he said it is more important to teach children and their parents how to deal with the media . double standard for games ? meanwhile , green party politicians warned that banning violent computer games could set up a double standard when compared with other entertainment media . " whoever considers banning games has to also use the same criteria when considering film and books , " volker beck , the head of the green parliamentary party , told the online newspaper netzeitung .
in addition , he said he considers a legally punishable ban on so-called " killer games " to be " short sighted and irrelevant . " it is more important for parents and guardians of the children to take responsibility for what media the minors in their care are consuming , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .
they have had a list of aliases , provided by spanish police , of el-masri 's likely kidnappers since the end of 2005 .
it took german prosecutors months , however , to make further enquires , the paper said . tortured in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri also gave a statement during the german inquiry according to el-masri , cia -lrb- the us secret service -rrb- agents believed he was a terrorist and abducted him in macedonia at the end of december 2003 .
he said he was taken to afghanistan , where he was repeatedly tortured during interrogations before being released in albania in may 2004 . el-masri has sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trial could compromise us security by disclosing secret information , but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . el-masri recently appealed that decision and has demanded an apology from the cia as well as an explanation for his abduction . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . last week , august hanning , the former head of the german foreign intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- said his agency played no part in el-masri 's kidnapping . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : 11 eu countries knew of secret cia prisons germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 06.12.2006 for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads failed to fly high in 2006 - due especially to problems at its airbus unit the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .
especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .
they have had a list of aliases , provided by spanish police , of el-masri 's likely kidnappers since the end of 2005 .
it took german prosecutors months , however , to make further enquires , the paper said . tortured in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri also gave a statement during the german inquiry according to el-masri , cia -lrb- the us secret service -rrb- agents believed he was a terrorist and abducted him in macedonia at the end of december 2003 .
he said he was taken to afghanistan , where he was repeatedly tortured during interrogations before being released in albania in may 2004 . el-masri has sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trial could compromise us security by disclosing secret information , but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . el-masri recently appealed that decision and has demanded an apology from the cia as well as an explanation for his abduction . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . last week , august hanning , the former head of the german foreign intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- said his agency played no part in el-masri 's kidnapping . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : 11 eu countries knew of secret cia prisons germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report .

the news came just two weeks after a firearms fanatic shot and wounded 37 people at a school in the western german town of emsdetten before committing suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman of the emsdetten massacre had this photo on his web site authorities searched students entering the schools in the southwestern town of offenburg near the french border , looking for weapons and dispatched police officers to guard the buildings . officers in cruisers and helicopters launched a manhunt for the missing pupil , who is considered a loner and vanished on monday .
a hotline was set up for concerned parents , teachers and students . planned bloodbath ? authorities sent out a warning to all the schools in the state of baden-württemberg on tuesday after two high school students playing the game " counter strike " on the internet encountered a third person who , during an online chat , announced there would be a bloodbath at his school on dec .
6 . recent incidents of school violence over the past several weeks have prompted calls for a ban on sales of violent computer games to minors . the states of bavaria and lower saxony have said they would like to ban so-called " killer games " with an initiative in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . lower saxony supports bavaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians called for banning violent games bavaria 's interior minister , the christian social union member günther beckstein , said he wants make the creation , sale and use of computer games that glorify violence punishable by law . uwe schünemann , lower saxony 's interior minister and christian democrat , said he supported the idea .
his ministry was working on a plan that would function together with bavaria 's , he said . " our goal is to have a bundesrat initiative by early 2007 , " schünemann said . according to beckstein 's suggestions , the sale , purchase and use of games that fail to respect human life would be punishable by up to a year of prison . but a speaker for the bavarian ministry , rainer riedl , said there needs to be some differentiation built in to the concept . " someone who designs and sells violent computer games for profit should be treated differently than someone who borrowed a game from a friend , " riedl said . plan meets opposition but the plan has met with criticism from politicians in the social democratic party , the junior partner in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition , and the opposition green party .
the plan is superficial and wo n't help , they say . " many politicians ca n't think of anything better to do in reaction to cases like emsdetten , " spd interior expert dieter wiefelspütz told the daily die welt newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning games is not an effective reaction to school shootings , wiefelspütz said some spd politicians agreed that a ban would make sense in the case of some games .
but ralf stegner , the interior minister from the state of schleswig-holstein , said a ban " only appears to be the safest way to protect children and teenagers . "
he said it is more important to teach children and their parents how to deal with the media . double standard for games ? meanwhile , green party politicians warned that banning violent computer games could set up a double standard when compared with other entertainment media . " whoever considers banning games has to also use the same criteria when considering film and books , " volker beck , the head of the green parliamentary party , told the online newspaper netzeitung .
in addition , he said he considers a legally punishable ban on so-called " killer games " to be " short sighted and irrelevant .

" secret service agents do n't call up their victims " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us judge told el-masri that a lawsuit could expose state secrets gnjidic has contested the measures as unconstitutional . prosecutors have justified their actions by saying el-masri 's kidnappers could have tried to contact him in order to threaten him or offer him a deal . the munich-based lawyer thilo pfordte , who is representing gnjidic at the constitutional court , said the prosecutors ' justification did n't hold water . " tapping telephone lines is not going to help in finding el-masri 's kidnappers , " he said .
" experience shows that secret service agents do not call up their victims on the telephone . " the süddeutsche claimed that police and prosecutors used the munich district court 's decision permitting the tapping for access to the paper 's research . pfordte said he saw it as more likely that prosecutors were interested in knowing what gnjidic told journalists than tracking down the kidnapping culprits . " they knew gnjidic was talking on the phone with journalists , not with el-masri 's kidnappers , " pfordte said . german government denies involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri said he was on one of the cia 's rendition flights two stern reporters were apparently looking into the identity of " sam , " an unknown man who spoke perfect german and who supposedly interrogated el-masri in afghanistan and accompanied him back to germany . the german government has denied any involvement in the case . hans-martin tillack , one of the reporters who was tapped , told the süddeutsche that the eavesdropping has further consequences . " i 'm shocked that journalists are the subject of the kind of measures that should be used to pursue the culprits , " he said . " it 's very dangerous when people start getting the impression that prosecutors can listen in on journalists , " tillack added .
" that scares away potential informants . " prosecutors direct investigation into who allegedly kidnapped el-masri is moving slowly , according to the süddeutsche .
they have had a list of aliases , provided by spanish police , of el-masri 's likely kidnappers since the end of 2005 .
it took german prosecutors months , however , to make further enquires , the paper said . tortured in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri also gave a statement during the german inquiry according to el-masri , cia -lrb- the us secret service -rrb- agents believed he was a terrorist and abducted him in macedonia at the end of december 2003 .
he said he was taken to afghanistan , where he was repeatedly tortured during interrogations before being released in albania in may 2004 . el-masri has sued former cia chief george tenet and other officials , but the case was dismissed by a us court in may .
it ruled that a trial could compromise us security by disclosing secret information , but added that if his story were true , el-masri was entitled to " a remedy " from the us administration . el-masri recently appealed that decision and has demanded an apology from the cia as well as an explanation for his abduction . a german parliamentary committee is investigating the affair because of allegations that berlin had known of el-masri 's plight but failed to act . last week , august hanning , the former head of the german foreign intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- said his agency played no part in el-masri 's kidnapping . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : 11 eu countries knew of secret cia prisons germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .

5 and spanks young women on the behind .
and he whacks them hard , using a big curved cow-horn . borkum boasts six of these such red-nosed " klaases " who sport huge sheepskins on their backs and have cow-tails .
they drink schnapps with the local men and dance on the bar tables till late in the night and they give gifts to the children . this old whaling custom has very little to do with the celebrated fourth-century bishop from asia minor , but it is how the islanders celebrate st. nicholas day .
in what seems to outsiders to be no more than an excuse for drunken debauchery , the night is reputed for being great fun and the young islanders start their preparations months in advance . a humble and generous bishop becomes a legend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas , a fourth-century bishop from asia minor more traditionally , however , nicholas is known as a gaunt bishop from the ancient city of myra , now in turkey .
he apparently became a bishop at the age of 19 and gave away his inheritance to the poor .
his humility and generosity gave rise to a wealth of legends . one story tells of nicholas coaxing grain intended for the emperor from some sailors in the local port to feed the poor during a famine .
when the cargo was unloaded in byzantium , not a single grain was said to be missing . another time , he bailed out an impoverished father whose daughters could not marry because he had no dowry for them .
three nights running , nicholas threw gold nuggets into the young women 's bedroom and thus the wedding bells were able to toll . over time , the gold nuggets were transformed into golden apples , whereas the kaiser 's grain became tasty foodstuffs and candy . nicholas ' punishing helper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together they mete out praise and punishment but st. nicholas did n't run a one-man operation .
the good , generous nicholas was said to be accompanied by an angry side-kick whose task it is to mete out punishment to mischievous children .
in germany , this devilish being goes as knecht ruprecht , in switzerland his name is smutzli , in austria he is known as krampli and in holland he is zwarte piet , the black peter . just as their names differ , so do their appearances and their use of rods , whips and rattling chains .
however , their common role , which arose in the middle ages , was customarily to frighten children into good behavior with threats of being whipped , slit open or gobbled up . according to the dutch , sinterklaas , wearing his bishop 's garb , and zwarte piet in his devil 's dress , live in spain most of the year , monitoring the children from afar .
but , once a year in november , they set anchor in holland and their arrival is broadcast on television and the duo travels across the netherlands , giving out praise and punishment . well-behaved dutch children receive their annual gifts on dec .
6 , instead of dec .
25 .
naughty children , however , get the rod - with zwarte piet scooping up the worst of the worst into his sack and taking them all the way back to spain . legends all rolled into one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus as he is known today with his helpers the reindeers in finland , nicholas goes by joulupukki .
he is neither holy nor devilish but pretty pagan .
he lives in lapland and distributes gifts on dec .
6 , which are reminiscent of pagan times .
a descendent of this 900-year-old man has been trying to prove his existence for years .
in his version of the st. nick story , the sack and the rod are symbols of male fertility . saint nicholas , black pete and santa claus have merged into one happy entity , as have the myths and legends , culminating in a cheery christmas celebration at the end of the year .
the christian reformers of the middle ages had their part in this metamorphosis and people transposed their pagan customs to christmas . whatever the tradition today 's children believe , the hope that nicholas has paid them an overnight visit leaving them gifts and candy has become the norm .
whether he put them in their clean shoes , threw them through the window or sneaked them into their stockings hanging above the fireplace is irrelevant .
santa claus can also wear a bishop 's hat , a long beard or daddy 's bathrobe for all they care . the ubiquitous , super-cuddly , white-bearded santa claus who has become so well-loved among children across the world is a recent invention .
he appeared on the world-stage during a 1930s coca-cola advertising campaign .
his permanent grin has not been wiped off since . matthias lemme -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin begging for more santas germany 's unemployment rates are falling , but the german capital is experiencing a serious shortage of santa clauses this year .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .

the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .
the " rebels " were publicly hanged . " we want young people who visit to go away with not only a picture of the holocaust as the greatest tragedy of humanity , but also of what was positive - the heroism of the victims , and their mutual support and solidarity , " cywinski said . dw staff / afp -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .
“ you can not straighten something out in just a few months , if it took years to mess up . ” more bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas enders , right , with ex-co-chair noel forgeard on wednesday , bad news hung around eads like a rain cloud .
french newspaper le monde reported that an ongoing investigation into possible insider trading at eads involved more than 800 people .
and the wall street journal online edition said german air carrier lufthansa , hitherto a loyal airbus client , was to make a firm order for 20 boeing 747-8 jumbo jets . prior to working in industry , enders was in the planning department of germany ’ s ministry of defense .
in a talk late monday in munich , the eads chief opted for brutally truthful analyses : he acknowledged that a good deal of the problems came from within the company .
airbus had been given too much leeway for years , he said .
some divisions and countries had worked alongside each other without making use of synergies . in the area of long-haul airplanes , airbus failed to meet its clients ’ needs with its initial design for a new a350 model .
“ we underestimated boeing ’ s 787 , and out clients let us know , “ enders said . " marathon ahead " development costs for the new a350 are now at 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- - twice as much as originally thought .
and the plane will be on the market five years after boeing ’ s 787 . “ getting airbus to be competitive again will be like running a marathon , ” enders told the press on monday .
on the long road , eads will certainly be looking to its arch rival for some tips – for instance , looking at exactly how boeing ’ s restructuring was done , and seeing how useful it was to sell factories . he admitted that it is difficult to deal with certain topics given the fragile balancing act between french and german owners .
political influences make it difficult to make hard-hitting change in the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus a380 on its first test flight with passengers in september - well behind schedule eads arose out of the union of german aerospace concern dasa and france ’ s aerospatiale matra .
it was meant to take over a pilot function , and lead the way for further inter-european business cooperation .
but this has hardly been the case .
advances in creating overarching european business agreements have moved “ at a snail ’ s pace , ” complained enders .
sometimes , things even seem to be moving backwards , he said .
sensitivity to nationality has not gotten less – on the contrary . political wasps ' nest “ europe is not very useful when it comes to exploiting synergy potentials , ” he said .
political pressure – from both sides – has become a thorn in enders ’ side . but eads claims it wants to use ist current problems as an opportunity .
other companies have come out of such a situation stronger , enders noted .

especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 . at a conference where he took stock of his first 12 months in office , thomas enders , the 47- year-old co-ceo of european arms and airplane concern eads , called 2006 an “ annus horribilis ” – a terrible year . the company needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
also in 2006 , several managers resigned , including disputed french co-ceo noël forgeard . enders said whipping its airplane-making subsidiary , airbus , into shape would be particularly challenging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 06.12.2006 iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's ahmadinejad has called the holocaust " a myth " a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .
iran is behind the meeting , which is expected to be a platform for holocaust deniers . iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has dismissed the holocaust as a myth . and last january , the iranian government announced it would hold a conference on the holocaust .
it said it intended to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler and the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir , both of whom are holocaust deniers . back in january , western politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the plan - although it was debated at the time whether the conference would actually take place , and what it was intended to provoke .
now , however , it seems clear that it will take place after all . questioning the gas chambers iran 's foreign ministry has invited scholars from 30 countries to discuss questions such as the scale of the holocaust , and whether or not the nazis really used gas chambers to kill jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british holocaust denier david irving lost his case deputy foreign minister manouchehr mohammadi said 67 researchers from countries including britain , germany and france would take part in the two-day meeting starting on monday , according to wednesday 's jomhuri-ye eslami newspaper . not in attendance will be british historian david irving .
he was on the original invitation list , but is currently serving a three-year jail term in austria for holocaust denial . ahmadinejad : holocaust open to question ahmadinejad caused international outrage last year when he said the holocaust - in which six million jews were killed by the nazis - was a myth .
he has not repeated that remark but has said the holocaust is open to question . foreign minister mohammadi said the aim of the conference , dubbed " holocaust , world prospect , " was to give scholars a chance to discuss the issue freely . holocaust denial is a crime in germany and austria when the conference plans were firsted announced in january , german green party chief reinhard bütikofer called it further evidence that ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . " legal consequences ?
but speaking in an interview with german magazine der spiegel earlier this year , gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party , warned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .
holocaust denial is a criminal offence in germany . but according to gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight , " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if -lrb- anyone -rrb- speaks there they will not be punished .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .
the " rebels " were publicly hanged . " we want young people who visit to go away with not only a picture of the holocaust as the greatest tragedy of humanity , but also of what was positive - the heroism of the victims , and their mutual support and solidarity , " cywinski said . dw staff / afp -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive berliners celebrate new shopping hours singing : the price merkel pays for the chancellery society -pipe- 06.12.2006 saint nicholas : the bearded legend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saint nicholas with staff and mitre while germany 's children are looking into the shoes they put out before going to bed and spent the night hoping to find them filled with candy in the morning , kids in other countries might be scared they 'll get the whip . the island of borkum has an unusual way of celebrating the feast of st. nicholas . saint nicholas , known as klaasohm in the regional low german dialect , roams the island in the night of dec .
5 and spanks young women on the behind .
and he whacks them hard , using a big curved cow-horn . borkum boasts six of these such red-nosed " klaases " who sport huge sheepskins on their backs and have cow-tails .
they drink schnapps with the local men and dance on the bar tables till late in the night and they give gifts to the children . this old whaling custom has very little to do with the celebrated fourth-century bishop from asia minor , but it is how the islanders celebrate st. nicholas day .
in what seems to outsiders to be no more than an excuse for drunken debauchery , the night is reputed for being great fun and the young islanders start their preparations months in advance . a humble and generous bishop becomes a legend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas , a fourth-century bishop from asia minor more traditionally , however , nicholas is known as a gaunt bishop from the ancient city of myra , now in turkey .
he apparently became a bishop at the age of 19 and gave away his inheritance to the poor .
his humility and generosity gave rise to a wealth of legends . one story tells of nicholas coaxing grain intended for the emperor from some sailors in the local port to feed the poor during a famine .
when the cargo was unloaded in byzantium , not a single grain was said to be missing . another time , he bailed out an impoverished father whose daughters could not marry because he had no dowry for them .
three nights running , nicholas threw gold nuggets into the young women 's bedroom and thus the wedding bells were able to toll . over time , the gold nuggets were transformed into golden apples , whereas the kaiser 's grain became tasty foodstuffs and candy . nicholas ' punishing helper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together they mete out praise and punishment but st. nicholas did n't run a one-man operation .
the good , generous nicholas was said to be accompanied by an angry side-kick whose task it is to mete out punishment to mischievous children .
in germany , this devilish being goes as knecht ruprecht , in switzerland his name is smutzli , in austria he is known as krampli and in holland he is zwarte piet , the black peter . just as their names differ , so do their appearances and their use of rods , whips and rattling chains .
however , their common role , which arose in the middle ages , was customarily to frighten children into good behavior with threats of being whipped , slit open or gobbled up . according to the dutch , sinterklaas , wearing his bishop 's garb , and zwarte piet in his devil 's dress , live in spain most of the year , monitoring the children from afar .
but , once a year in november , they set anchor in holland and their arrival is broadcast on television and the duo travels across the netherlands , giving out praise and punishment . well-behaved dutch children receive their annual gifts on dec .
6 , instead of dec .
25 .
naughty children , however , get the rod - with zwarte piet scooping up the worst of the worst into his sack and taking them all the way back to spain . legends all rolled into one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus as he is known today with his helpers the reindeers in finland , nicholas goes by joulupukki .
he is neither holy nor devilish but pretty pagan .
he lives in lapland and distributes gifts on dec .
6 , which are reminiscent of pagan times .
a descendent of this 900-year-old man has been trying to prove his existence for years .
in his version of the st. nick story , the sack and the rod are symbols of male fertility . saint nicholas , black pete and santa claus have merged into one happy entity , as have the myths and legends , culminating in a cheery christmas celebration at the end of the year .
the christian reformers of the middle ages had their part in this metamorphosis and people transposed their pagan customs to christmas . whatever the tradition today 's children believe , the hope that nicholas has paid them an overnight visit leaving them gifts and candy has become the norm .
whether he put them in their clean shoes , threw them through the window or sneaked them into their stockings hanging above the fireplace is irrelevant .
santa claus can also wear a bishop 's hat , a long beard or daddy 's bathrobe for all they care . the ubiquitous , super-cuddly , white-bearded santa claus who has become so well-loved among children across the world is a recent invention .
he appeared on the world-stage during a 1930s coca-cola advertising campaign .
his permanent grin has not been wiped off since . matthias lemme -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin begging for more santas germany 's unemployment rates are falling , but the german capital is experiencing a serious shortage of santa clauses this year .

the news came just two weeks after a firearms fanatic shot and wounded 37 people at a school in the western german town of emsdetten before committing suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman of the emsdetten massacre had this photo on his web site authorities searched students entering the schools in the southwestern town of offenburg near the french border , looking for weapons and dispatched police officers to guard the buildings . officers in cruisers and helicopters launched a manhunt for the missing pupil , who is considered a loner and vanished on monday .

6 . recent incidents of school violence over the past several weeks have prompted calls for a ban on sales of violent computer games to minors . the states of bavaria and lower saxony have said they would like to ban so-called " killer games " with an initiative in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . lower saxony supports bavaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians called for banning violent games bavaria 's interior minister , the christian social union member günther beckstein , said he wants make the creation , sale and use of computer games that glorify violence punishable by law . uwe schünemann , lower saxony 's interior minister and christian democrat , said he supported the idea .
his ministry was working on a plan that would function together with bavaria 's , he said . " our goal is to have a bundesrat initiative by early 2007 , " schünemann said . according to beckstein 's suggestions , the sale , purchase and use of games that fail to respect human life would be punishable by up to a year of prison . but a speaker for the bavarian ministry , rainer riedl , said there needs to be some differentiation built in to the concept . " someone who designs and sells violent computer games for profit should be treated differently than someone who borrowed a game from a friend , " riedl said . plan meets opposition but the plan has met with criticism from politicians in the social democratic party , the junior partner in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition , and the opposition green party .
the plan is superficial and wo n't help , they say . " many politicians ca n't think of anything better to do in reaction to cases like emsdetten , " spd interior expert dieter wiefelspütz told the daily die welt newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning games is not an effective reaction to school shootings , wiefelspütz said some spd politicians agreed that a ban would make sense in the case of some games .
but ralf stegner , the interior minister from the state of schleswig-holstein , said a ban " only appears to be the safest way to protect children and teenagers . "
he said it is more important to teach children and their parents how to deal with the media . double standard for games ? meanwhile , green party politicians warned that banning violent computer games could set up a double standard when compared with other entertainment media . " whoever considers banning games has to also use the same criteria when considering film and books , " volker beck , the head of the green parliamentary party , told the online newspaper netzeitung .

6 . recent incidents of school violence over the past several weeks have prompted calls for a ban on sales of violent computer games to minors . the states of bavaria and lower saxony have said they would like to ban so-called " killer games " with an initiative in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . lower saxony supports bavaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians called for banning violent games bavaria 's interior minister , the christian social union member günther beckstein , said he wants make the creation , sale and use of computer games that glorify violence punishable by law . uwe schünemann , lower saxony 's interior minister and christian democrat , said he supported the idea .
his ministry was working on a plan that would function together with bavaria 's , he said . " our goal is to have a bundesrat initiative by early 2007 , " schünemann said . according to beckstein 's suggestions , the sale , purchase and use of games that fail to respect human life would be punishable by up to a year of prison . but a speaker for the bavarian ministry , rainer riedl , said there needs to be some differentiation built in to the concept . " someone who designs and sells violent computer games for profit should be treated differently than someone who borrowed a game from a friend , " riedl said . plan meets opposition but the plan has met with criticism from politicians in the social democratic party , the junior partner in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition , and the opposition green party .
the plan is superficial and wo n't help , they say . " many politicians ca n't think of anything better to do in reaction to cases like emsdetten , " spd interior expert dieter wiefelspütz told the daily die welt newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning games is not an effective reaction to school shootings , wiefelspütz said some spd politicians agreed that a ban would make sense in the case of some games .
but ralf stegner , the interior minister from the state of schleswig-holstein , said a ban " only appears to be the safest way to protect children and teenagers . "
he said it is more important to teach children and their parents how to deal with the media . double standard for games ? meanwhile , green party politicians warned that banning violent computer games could set up a double standard when compared with other entertainment media . " whoever considers banning games has to also use the same criteria when considering film and books , " volker beck , the head of the green parliamentary party , told the online newspaper netzeitung .
in addition , he said he considers a legally punishable ban on so-called " killer games " to be " short sighted and irrelevant . " it is more important for parents and guardians of the children to take responsibility for what media the minors in their care are consuming , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .

" more than a million people visit the museum every year , and that means the first floor beams in the auschwitz blocks wo n't hold up for long , " cywinski told reporters . the stairs leading up to the exhibits have eroded over the years .
they are housed in the original camp 's former cell blocks .
the camp was set up by the nazis on a former polish army barracks , not far from the southern town of oswiecim . new concept marks a change of approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names at the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem cywinski announced that the international auschwitz council in warsaw had unanimously approved plans to draw up a new concept for the museum , which would be put to survivors , historians , conservationists and religious leaders .
the decision to renovate and actively preserve the remains of the camp marks a change in the long-standing approach to maintaining the site . the site was left in the state the allies found it when they liberated the camp .
in an effort to cover up their atrocities , the nazis had blown up the gas chambers before fleeing the camp as the soviet red army advanced into poland .
the rubble was left so .
this was a decision made in the early years of communist rule but the director believes it is time for a change . " first set up in the 1950s , the exhibits are old , " he said .
" new exhibits must take into account not only the historical knowledge acquired over the years , but also new means of organizing the museum . "
he argued that the auschwitz exhibition was dated by comparison with the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial museum in washington d.c. austerity is a message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's main gate cywinski insisted , however , that the renovation work would respect the memory of what had taken place .
" auschwitz will retain its simplicity .
its very austerity is a message , " he stated . at auschwitz 's nearby annex , the birkenau death camp , walls will be constructed around the ruins of the gas chambers and adjoining crematoria to prevent them from sinking into the ground .
these were purpose-built by the nazis to allow them more systematically to carry out the " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jews . the first trainload of prisoners , mostly polish resistance fighters , arrived at auschwitz in june 1940 .
the camp quickly gained a reputation for torture and mass shootings .
construction of birkenau began in 1941 , and the deadly annex became fully functional two years later . many of the 1.1 million people documented to have died at auschwitz-birkenau were jews , but roma and sinti , soviet prisoners of war , polish political prisoners , homosexuals , members of the clergy and others were also murdered there .
those who were not killed in the gas chambers died from overwork , starvation and disease . courage and solidarity to be honored by new exhibits cywinski said that the renovated museum would include a number of new exhibits , including ones which examine the world 's silence and the lack of efforts to halt the nazis ' extermination of millions of people , as well as one about the sonderkommando revolt of autumn 1944 .
this squad of jewish prisoners had the task of emptying the gas chambers and burning the bodies of the dead .
one group rebelled , blowing up a crematorium and killing three guards .
several hundred prisoners were able to escape but most were then recaptured and killed .
the " rebels " were publicly hanged . " we want young people who visit to go away with not only a picture of the holocaust as the greatest tragedy of humanity , but also of what was positive - the heroism of the victims , and their mutual support and solidarity , " cywinski said . dw staff / afp -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin holocaust memorial takes shape after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend .

by greg morsbach bbc news , caracas now that the dust has settled after president hugo chavez 's landslide victory , there is much speculation as to how venezuela will change in the next few years under his leadership .
chavez has been engaging in long-term thinking mr chavez has openly talked of his third term in office as " a new phase " in his long term project for the latin american country .
he has made no secret during or after his election campaign that his " bolivarian revolution " , named after the 19th century south american independence leader simon bolivar , is heading towards socialism .
in the next 14 years , mr chavez wants to turn venezuela from a capitalist into a socialist society .
the strategic roadmap to help him do that has already been drawn up and is called " the simon bolivar national plan " .
a pro-chavez member of parliament , carlos escarra , told the bbc he has been appointed personally by mr chavez to prepare sweeping reforms of the nation 's constitution .
name change mr escarra , who is now part of a presidential commission on constitutional reform , said : " one of the proposals is to change the name of our country from bolivarian republic of venezuela to socialist and bolivarian republic .
" this would better reflect the changes that are happening here .
but there are also more basic changes to our constitution that are being planned .
" for example , we want to eliminate the old , bureaucratic structures of the state and replace them with grass roots institutions . "
profile : hugo chavez mr chavez has often talked of how he intends to stay in power until the year 2021 to implement his socialist project .
to remain in office for that long , mr chavez and his followers want to change the constitution in order to remove the limits on how many times he can be re-elected in succession .
" that 's definitely part of the plan for next year , " said hector navarro , a senior director for mr chavez 's election campaign team .
" remember that president chavez was re-elected by a wide margin .
so that gives him the popular mandate and legitimacy to make big changes . "
however , any changes to venezuela 's constitution must first be approved with a two-thirds majority in parliament , and then in a nationwide referendum .
but this should not pose too much of a problem for venezuela 's left-wing leader as parliament is entirely run by his loyalists and a large segment of the population is on record as supporting him .
constitutional reform december 2007 has been touted as a possible date for a referendum on the constitution , giving the president plenty of time to prepare the details and seek popular support .
there will be other changes in addition to the constitutional reform , according to many respected analysts .
most predict that venezuela 's private economy will disappear as we know it .
orlando ochoa , a leading economist , forecasts that the free market economy will be replaced by a socialist model where the state will have much greater control over the private sector .
" the state will regulate prices and profits in the private sector , " mr ochoa said .
transformations alberto garrido , an independent analyst , is certain that in the next 14 years parts of the economy will simply vanish .
" private health care and private education will be first in line to be scrapped by the government as part of its drive towards socialism , " said mr garrido .
" the whole country will be geared towards the motto : one leader - one party - one ideology , " he added .
one proposal that is on the table for next year is to create a single political party to represent the chavistas , the name given to mr chavez 's supporters .
remember that president chavez was re-elected by a wide margin .
so that gives him the popular mandate and legitimacy to make big changes viewpoints on mr chavez currently there are a string of parties supporting mr chavez - each with their own leaders and party hierarchy .
in terms of foreign relations it is almost certain that the chavez government will opt for continuity : there is very little appetite in caracas for a rapprochement with washington and the bush administration at present .
despite the best efforts of the state department to build bridges following his election victory , there was a frosty reception from venezuela 's firebrand leader .
he dismissed washington 's diplomatic overtures as " insincere " .
" they sometimes hold an olive branch out to us .
but there are always strings attached .
and we , as a sovereign state , can not accept conditions , " mr chavez told reporters here at a recent news conference .
however , senior venezuelan diplomats privately admitted they could envisage a completely different relationship with a democrat in the white house , particularly with somebody from the clinton family .
no scrutiny venezuela 's deputy foreign minister for north american affairs , jorge valero , told the bbc " in the next few years , there will be a lot more cooperation between our government and the nations of the southern hemisphere " .
venezuela is also trying to substitute the us with china as its number one commercial partner .
" the idea for the next few years for venezuela to sell all the crude oil it presently shipping to the us to the chinese instead , " said alberto garrido .
the ultimate goal is to become completely economically independent from the us because mr chavez does not want to be a leader who is at the beck and call of the political and economic establishment of north america .
he does not wish to have his democratic credentials , his style of government and his socialist project scrutinised internationally .

by greg morsbach bbc news , caracas now that the dust has settled after president hugo chavez 's landslide victory , there is much speculation as to how venezuela will change in the next few years under his leadership .
chavez has been engaging in long-term thinking mr chavez has openly talked of his third term in office as " a new phase " in his long term project for the latin american country .
he has made no secret during or after his election campaign that his " bolivarian revolution " , named after the 19th century south american independence leader simon bolivar , is heading towards socialism .
in the next 14 years , mr chavez wants to turn venezuela from a capitalist into a socialist society .
the strategic roadmap to help him do that has already been drawn up and is called " the simon bolivar national plan " .
a pro-chavez member of parliament , carlos escarra , told the bbc he has been appointed personally by mr chavez to prepare sweeping reforms of the nation 's constitution .
name change mr escarra , who is now part of a presidential commission on constitutional reform , said : " one of the proposals is to change the name of our country from bolivarian republic of venezuela to socialist and bolivarian republic .
" this would better reflect the changes that are happening here .
but there are also more basic changes to our constitution that are being planned .
" for example , we want to eliminate the old , bureaucratic structures of the state and replace them with grass roots institutions . "
profile : hugo chavez mr chavez has often talked of how he intends to stay in power until the year 2021 to implement his socialist project .
to remain in office for that long , mr chavez and his followers want to change the constitution in order to remove the limits on how many times he can be re-elected in succession .
" that 's definitely part of the plan for next year , " said hector navarro , a senior director for mr chavez 's election campaign team .
" remember that president chavez was re-elected by a wide margin .
so that gives him the popular mandate and legitimacy to make big changes . "
however , any changes to venezuela 's constitution must first be approved with a two-thirds majority in parliament , and then in a nationwide referendum .
but this should not pose too much of a problem for venezuela 's left-wing leader as parliament is entirely run by his loyalists and a large segment of the population is on record as supporting him .
constitutional reform december 2007 has been touted as a possible date for a referendum on the constitution , giving the president plenty of time to prepare the details and seek popular support .
there will be other changes in addition to the constitutional reform , according to many respected analysts .
most predict that venezuela 's private economy will disappear as we know it .
orlando ochoa , a leading economist , forecasts that the free market economy will be replaced by a socialist model where the state will have much greater control over the private sector .
" the state will regulate prices and profits in the private sector , " mr ochoa said .
transformations alberto garrido , an independent analyst , is certain that in the next 14 years parts of the economy will simply vanish .
" private health care and private education will be first in line to be scrapped by the government as part of its drive towards socialism , " said mr garrido .
" the whole country will be geared towards the motto : one leader - one party - one ideology , " he added .
one proposal that is on the table for next year is to create a single political party to represent the chavistas , the name given to mr chavez 's supporters .
remember that president chavez was re-elected by a wide margin .
so that gives him the popular mandate and legitimacy to make big changes viewpoints on mr chavez currently there are a string of parties supporting mr chavez - each with their own leaders and party hierarchy .
in terms of foreign relations it is almost certain that the chavez government will opt for continuity : there is very little appetite in caracas for a rapprochement with washington and the bush administration at present .
despite the best efforts of the state department to build bridges following his election victory , there was a frosty reception from venezuela 's firebrand leader .
he dismissed washington 's diplomatic overtures as " insincere " .
" they sometimes hold an olive branch out to us .
but there are always strings attached .
and we , as a sovereign state , can not accept conditions , " mr chavez told reporters here at a recent news conference .
however , senior venezuelan diplomats privately admitted they could envisage a completely different relationship with a democrat in the white house , particularly with somebody from the clinton family .
no scrutiny venezuela 's deputy foreign minister for north american affairs , jorge valero , told the bbc " in the next few years , there will be a lot more cooperation between our government and the nations of the southern hemisphere " .
venezuela is also trying to substitute the us with china as its number one commercial partner .
" the idea for the next few years for venezuela to sell all the crude oil it presently shipping to the us to the chinese instead , " said alberto garrido .
the ultimate goal is to become completely economically independent from the us because mr chavez does not want to be a leader who is at the beck and call of the political and economic establishment of north america .
he does not wish to have his democratic credentials , his style of government and his socialist project scrutinised internationally .

the cable firm , which first said it was interested in a merger with itv last month , said any deal was now unlikely to be attained on " acceptable terms " .
its comments come three weeks after satellite broadcaster bskyb bought a 17.9 % stake in itv for £ 940m in an apparent move to block any ntl bid .
ntl confirmed it had complained to regulators about bskyb 's move , saying it raised " serious competition issues " .
" the fact that sky would spend nearly $ 2bn to acquire its stake immediately following the mere announcement of ntl 's proposed combination , before the itv board had an opportunity to respond , highlights the magnitude of the competition issues involved , " ntl said .
bid battle bskyb , part of rupert murdoch 's media empire , says it has done nothing wrong in buying into itv .
current uk media ownership rules mean the satellite broadcaster is only prevented from controlling more than 20 % in itv .
ntl 's largest shareholder , sir richard branson , has attacked the power of mr murdoch and urged the government to " stand up " to him .
itv rejected ntl 's £ 4.7bn -lrb- $ 9.3bn -rrb- bid last month , saying there was little strategic logic for it to combine with ntl , and that the offer materially undervalued itv .
ntl said it would now concentrate on integrating its ntl and telewest cable businesses and the virgin mobile division .
the company is set to change its name to virgin media early next year .

click here to read about the three schools that took part the schoolchildren get to know each other christian , kanisius senior high school : as a catholic school we have our own chapel , and like other schools in general , we have sports facilities , like a football pitch and for basketball court .
abhyasa , kanisius senior high school : we start school at 0700 local time and finish at 1330 .
but on friday we finish earlier - 1130 .
how about at darunnajah ?
fadlan , darunnajah senior high school : our activities start at 0430 with morning prayer , then our school starts early at 0630 .
we finish at 1400 monday to thursday while on saturday and sunday , our school time finishes at midday .
we do n't have classes on friday .
aqsa , darunnajah senior high school : another thing is , the classes in our school are divided for boys and girls .
other unique thing is we have to speak english and arabic during school time .
how about at labschool ?
divya , labschool high school : it 's different from darunnajah .
the school is for boys and girls and there is no division .
we also start at 0700 but we finish much later than you guys , at 1530 .
on friday , we start at 0615 because we go jogging together , including the teachers - not only the students .
we go around the school complex .
question from moderator and presenter fadlan four of the participants are from faith schools and one from a non-faith school .
if we talk about religious tolerance , do the existing religious classes at school help to encourage religious tolerance ?
christian , kanisius senior high school : at kanisius , we have two religious teachers .
one teaches catholicism , and the other teaches ethics in general , including paying respect to other faiths .
abhyasa , kanisius senior high school : we are taught how to respect differences between us , so we can respect each other .
divya , labschool high school : what we have in our school , i think , the atmosphere , helps us a lot in encouraging religious tolerance .
during the islamic religious class , for example , students from other religions are also studying their respective religions in different classrooms .
komang , labschool high school : i think the religious classes that we have tend to teach us only to learn verses from the holy books .
sometime we only think about pursuing good grades .
what we need is to implement what we have learned from the religious classes .
aqsa , darunnajah senior high school : at our boarding school , we tend to learn only islamic teaching .
so we do n't know that much about other religions .
what we need , maybe , is a class that encourages religious tolerance .
question from moderator and presenter fadlan is that why religious conflicts still happen in indonesia ?
divya , labschool high school : maybe we need to have better understanding .
our school has an event , inviting students from schools from other parts of indonesia , including faith schools .
through this event , we can make friends , and understand our differences better .
abhyasa , kanisius senior high school : conflict happens because we do n't recognise differences among us .
at kanisius , we are taught how to recognise these differences .
for example , on fridays , we finish school earlier - before midday - to allow our muslim friends to attend friday prayers .
christian , kanisius senior high school : we are asked to make friends without seeing what religions they believe in .
this is important for us young people to understand each other better .
aqsa , darunnajah senior high school : at darunnajah , we meet others with different religions through our extra-curricular activities , like sports and scouts .
through this , we could make friends with those of other faiths .
if we understand each other better , i do n't think , conflicts , like those in poso will ever happen .
discussion with professor ato mudzar , head of research and development of the religious affairs ministry and professor suyanto , director general of the education ministry .
question from christian , kanisius senior high school religious conflicts may have happened because we are not taught to respect differences .
maybe we need to have more classes on religious tolerance ?
professor suyanto , director general of the education ministry : to encourage tolerance does not mean we need to have more religious classes .
the important thing is to implement what you have learned in religious classes to your daily life .
so , what we need is to recognise differences that we have .
professor ato mudzar , head of research and development of the religious affairs ministry : in indonesia , religious classes are designed to teach students to be true believers .
we do n't teach religious doctrine .
but what we encourage is that the students respect their friends from other beliefs .
we encourage students from faith schools to visit each other .
like you from kanisius go and visit darunnajah and the other way round .

click here to read about the three schools that took part the schoolchildren get to know each other christian , kanisius senior high school : as a catholic school we have our own chapel , and like other schools in general , we have sports facilities , like a football pitch and for basketball court .
abhyasa , kanisius senior high school : we start school at 0700 local time and finish at 1330 .
but on friday we finish earlier - 1130 .
how about at darunnajah ?
fadlan , darunnajah senior high school : our activities start at 0430 with morning prayer , then our school starts early at 0630 .
we finish at 1400 monday to thursday while on saturday and sunday , our school time finishes at midday .
we do n't have classes on friday .
aqsa , darunnajah senior high school : another thing is , the classes in our school are divided for boys and girls .
other unique thing is we have to speak english and arabic during school time .
how about at labschool ?
divya , labschool high school : it 's different from darunnajah .
the school is for boys and girls and there is no division .
we also start at 0700 but we finish much later than you guys , at 1530 .
on friday , we start at 0615 because we go jogging together , including the teachers - not only the students .
we go around the school complex .
question from moderator and presenter fadlan four of the participants are from faith schools and one from a non-faith school .
if we talk about religious tolerance , do the existing religious classes at school help to encourage religious tolerance ?
conducting the debate christian , kanisius senior high school : at kanisius , we have two religious teachers .
one teaches catholicism , and the other teaches ethics in general , including paying respect to other faiths .
abhyasa , kanisius senior high school : we are taught how to respect differences between us , so we can respect each other .
divya , labschool high school : what we have in our school , i think , the atmosphere , helps us a lot in encouraging religious tolerance .
during the islamic religious class , for example , students from other religions are also studying their respective religions in different classrooms .
komang , labschool high school : i think the religious classes that we have tend to teach us only to learn verses from the holy books .
sometime we only think about pursuing good grades .
what we need is to implement what we have learned from the religious classes .
aqsa , darunnajah senior high school : at our boarding school , we tend to learn only islamic teaching .
so we do n't know that much about other religions .
what we need , maybe , is a class that encourages religious tolerance .
question from moderator and presenter fadlan is that why religious conflicts still happen in indonesia ?
divya , labschool high school : maybe we need to have better understanding .
our school has an event , inviting students from schools from other parts of indonesia , including faith schools .
through this event , we can make friends , and understand our differences better .
abhyasa , kanisius senior high school : conflict happens because we do n't recognise differences among us .
at kanisius , we are taught how to recognise these differences .
for example , on fridays , we finish school earlier - before midday - to allow our muslim friends to attend friday prayers .
christian , kanisius senior high school : we are asked to make friends without seeing what religions they believe in .
this is important for us young people to understand each other better .
aqsa , darunnajah senior high school : at darunnajah , we meet others with different religions through our extra-curricular activities , like sports and scouts .
through this , we could make friends with those of other faiths .
if we understand each other better , i do n't think , conflicts , like those in poso will ever happen .
discussion with professor ato mudzar , head of research and development of the religious affairs ministry and professor suyanto , director general of the education ministry .
question from christian , kanisius senior high school religious conflicts may have happened because we are not taught to respect differences .
maybe we need to have more classes on religious tolerance ?
professor suyanto , director general of the education ministry : to encourage tolerance does not mean we need to have more religious classes .
the important thing is to implement what you have learned in religious classes to your daily life .
so , what we need is to recognise differences that we have .
professor ato mudzar , head of research and development of the religious affairs ministry : in indonesia , religious classes are designed to teach students to be true believers .
we do n't teach religious doctrine .
but what we encourage is that the students respect their friends from other beliefs .
we encourage students from faith schools to visit each other .
like you from kanisius go and visit darunnajah and the other way round .
the important thing is to have good communications and have joint events .

the economy expanded by just 0.3 % in the three months to september , compared with the previous quarter , the slowest rate in more than three years .
australia 's key crop production fell by more than a third during the quarter , hit by the worst drought in a century .
however , mining-led exports helped keep the economy growing , despite an overall drop in business investment .
" in the period ahead , growth is likely to remain modest , reflecting the effects of the severe drought , " said australia 's finance minister peter costello .
the reserve bank of australia last month warned that the national drought was likely to slow economic growth , as a result of a drop in farming output .
it predicted that the drought would cut annual economic growth from 1.9 % to 1.15 % .
australia 's central bank has been pursuing a policy of interest rate rises in recent months , and increased base rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 6.25 % in november in a bid to keep a lid on inflation .
analysts said two previous interest rate rises earlier in the year were already showing signs of having an effect on the economy .

the economy expanded by just 0.3 % in the three months to september , compared with the previous quarter , the slowest rate in more than three years .
australia 's key crop production fell by more than a third during the quarter , hit by the worst drought in a century .
however , mining-led exports helped keep the economy growing , despite an overall drop in business investment .
" in the period ahead , growth is likely to remain modest , reflecting the effects of the severe drought , " said australia 's finance minister peter costello .
the reserve bank of australia last month warned that the national drought was likely to slow economic growth , as a result of a drop in farming output .
it predicted that the drought would cut annual economic growth from 1.9 % to 1.15 % .
australia 's central bank has been pursuing a policy of interest rate rises in recent months , and increased base rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 6.25 % in november in a bid to keep a lid on inflation .
analysts said two previous interest rate rises earlier in the year were already showing signs of having an effect on the economy .

click here to read about the schools that took part question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk does science play a very important role in your daily life ?
are you not interested in science and is it boring ?
emily : i do n't think that science is boring .
in this country , it is very hard to get into .
i 'm very fortunate to be in a school where we 're all very enthusiastic about science .
joe : we in the uk do find science interesting .
i do - i 'm doing science subjects at school .
but the uk 's a developed nation , and for the malaysian students science is very important to help them develop their country .
in the uk , we do n't see science like that because we do n't need to develop our country further .
all we need to do is maintain the same level of activity .
question from royal latin school , buckingham , uk to pupils at mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia in this country it is really competitive and quite hard to get into medicine .
how easy is it to get into that sort of field in malaysia ?
gurpreet : it 's not hard to enter medicine because we know our topics and syllabus , we know what we are going into .
so we will automatically work hard to get into medicine because we know that 's what we are aiming for , and we know that science is our major , so we will do our best in it .
question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk i would like to know how the teaching at your place is done because teaching affects our impression of science .
greta : i think that in sixth form we are very fortunate to have good teachers at the moment , but i 've definitely experienced some bad teachers before coming to this school .
emily : i think if you have the facilities and enthusiastic teachers , that 's definitely going to get you interested .
if your school does n't have facilities or teachers who are interested in their subject , then you 're going to be put off it , but we 're very lucky in our school that we have that .
question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk as we are well informed , mathematics and science are very well rated , and some say mathematics is the language of science .
how do students in the uk respond to mathematics ?
emily : i think that for most of the students in this school who take all three sciences , maths is an accompaniment .
a lot of people only take it for one year because it is very difficult and it gets a lot harder after gcse / o-level , but it is quite popular to do alongside science .
question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk before you started studying science , what inspired you to want to do it ?
was it your family or friends or people around you ?
chang : what inspired us from a young age is the government , because the government encourages us a lot .
ever since primary school they have been saying : " science is good " .
they have campaigns about science , and when we come to secondary school , teachers will say to good students who have good results and are able to study : " you should take science , it 's good for your future . "
triven : the wheels of a bicycle inspired me .
as you cycle , you see the wheels turning round , at one moment it 's up and the next it 's down .
it 's all about science .
the energy absorbed in the tyre is what inspired me .
un-named female student : for me , my parents inspired me , they let me read science magazines when i was young , and they said : " science is very good , you should take science when you 're older . "

click here to read about the schools that took part question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk does science play a very important role in your daily life ?
are you not interested in science and is it boring ?
the royal latin is a specialist science college emily : i do n't think that science is boring .
in this country , it is very hard to get into .
i 'm very fortunate to be in a school where we 're all very enthusiastic about science .
joe : we in the uk do find science interesting .
i do - i 'm doing science subjects at school .
but the uk 's a developed nation , and for the malaysian students science is very important to help them develop their country .
in the uk , we do n't see science like that because we do n't need to develop our country further .
all we need to do is maintain the same level of activity .
question from royal latin school , buckingham , uk to pupils at mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia in this country it is really competitive and quite hard to get into medicine .
how easy is it to get into that sort of field in malaysia ?
gurpreet : it 's not hard to enter medicine because we know our topics and syllabus , we know what we are going into .
so we will automatically work hard to get into medicine because we know that 's what we are aiming for , and we know that science is our major , so we will do our best in it .
question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk i would like to know how the teaching at your place is done because teaching affects our impression of science .
greta : i think that in sixth form we are very fortunate to have good teachers at the moment , but i 've definitely experienced some bad teachers before coming to this school .
emily : i think if you have the facilities and enthusiastic teachers , that 's definitely going to get you interested .
if your school does n't have facilities or teachers who are interested in their subject , then you 're going to be put off it , but we 're very lucky in our school that we have that .
question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk as we are well informed , mathematics and science are very well rated , and some say mathematics is the language of science .
how do students in the uk respond to mathematics ?
emily : i think that for most of the students in this school who take all three sciences , maths is an accompaniment .
a lot of people only take it for one year because it is very difficult and it gets a lot harder after gcse / o-level , but it is quite popular to do alongside science .
question from mrsm residential school , kuala kubu baru , malaysia to pupils at royal latin school , buckingham , uk before you started studying science , what inspired you to want to do it ?

the school is one of several boarding schools run by mara -lrb- majlis amanah rakyat - indigenous people 's trust council -rrb- .
originally , only malay children could go to mara schools , but nowadays ethnic chinese and ethnic indian children are also accepted .
most students come from rural areas .
they have to pay a small entrance fee .
if their parents can not afford the tuition fees , they will be paid for by mara .
in the school , the atmosphere is very competitive .
the students know that if they do well , they are likely to qualify for another mara scholarship that will pay for their higher education .

click to return to top royal latin school , buckingham , uk the royal latin school is about two hours ' drive from london .
it is surrounded by typical english parkland with many beautiful trees , rare plants and wildlife .
unlike most government-funded schools in the uk , the royal latin is selective .
pupils have to pass a written test before they are admitted .
this system of selecting pupils on academic ability is controversial in the uk as some people think it creates upper and lower classes of school .
the royal latin is a specialist science college .
it receives extra money from the government to be spent on science facilities such as lab equipment and computers .
it also means that pupils and teachers from the school are able to visit surrounding schools and help and encourage others to ' switch on ' to science .
but evidence suggests that the uk government 's efforts to increase interest in science amongst school-aged children are n't working .
many young people in the uk just are n't interested in science , and even though the royal latin pupils we spoke to for the programme are very interested in science , they know there is an attitude problem amongst other people of the same age .
emily is studying three sciences at a-level .
she says she chose to study science because she likes to know what is going on around her and why .
but why is science losing popularity amongst young people in the uk ?
the royal latin is a specialist science college " part of the problem is you 're seen as uncool .
there 's a big trend in the uk at the minute ... if you 're creative that 's a good thing to be - not scientific . "
also - " a lot of famous people in the uk , celebrities , are famous because they 've been on reality tv , not because they 've invented something . "
greta is taking physics , chemistry and biology at a-level and she wants to go on to study medicine .
she says science definitely has an image problem as , " there are no famous scientists in the uk that i 'd want to be like " , but she also says the way science is portrayed in the media is also a problem .
" news articles about science tend to be negative - bad drugs trials , moral issues to do with stem cells etc , " she says .
sam is studying the same subjects as greta and also want to go on to study medicine .
he thinks money may be part of the problem with science in the uk : " it 's a materialistic society - very few of the rich have risen there through science . "
the pupils from the royal latin school were also joined by two students from neighbouring buckingham school for the recording of the programme .

corot will be the first spacecraft capable of detecting rocky planets just a few times bigger than earth that are orbiting neighbouring stars .
it will also uncover information on the stars themselves , determining their mass , age and chemical composition .
the multinational mission , led by the french space agency cnes , is due to launch on 27 december .
thien lam trong , corot project manager from cnes , said : " man has been thinking about other worlds since the beginning of astronomy .
corot will help us to understand whether earth-like exoplanets are a reality or dream . "
the 650kg -lrb- 1,400lb -rrb- satellite will be launched on the soyuz-2-1b vehicle from the baikonur cosmodrome , kazakhstan , into a polar orbit 827km -lrb- 514 miles -rrb- above the earth .
corot carries a 27cm -lrb- 11in -rrb- telescope and a four-charge-coupled-device -lrb- ccd -rrb- camera , sensitive to tiny changes in the brightness of stars .
" there are two main science objectives for this mission , " said ian roxburgh , professor of astronomy at queen mary , university of london , who is the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- scientist on corot .
esa is a partner on corot along with austria , spain , germany , belgium and brazil .
and one of these , he said , would be to monitor about 60,000 stars to find some of the planets orbiting them .
" as a planet comes inbetween us , the observer , and the star , it goes across the front of the star and blocks out some of the light - this is called a transit , like the transit of venus .
" so we will be measuring the light from the stars , looking for decreases in brightness to detect if a planet is in orbit . "
over a period of about 2.5 years , the satellite will focus on five to six different areas of the sky , each time for a duration of about 150 days .
every 512 seconds , it will measure the brightness of approximately 10,000 stars captured by the onboard camera , which employs the same technology as everyday digital cameras , allowing minute changes in the intensity of their light to be detected .
by measuring these contrasts , the scientists will be able to detect many different types of planets , from huge gaseous ones to small rocky planets .
but it is the smaller planets that are of most interest to the team .
while larger planets can be detected from the ground using a variety of techniques , explained professor roxburgh , planets nearing earth 's size can not .
corot will be the first spacecraft capable of finding them , he said .
" we should be able to get down to planets about twice as big as earth . "
the team are expecting to find between 10-40 of these smaller planets and tens of larger gaseous ones in each of the star fields the team observes .
star variety the other part of the mission is to find out more about the stars themselves .
by observing the subtle changes in light created as sound waves ripple through the star - a technique called asteroseismology -lrb- similar to seismology , which uses earthquake waves -rrb- - the team will be able to find out more about the body 's interior and determine its mass , age and chemical composition .
professor roxburgh said the team aimed to find out more about 60 of the brightest stars in the area of sky they are observing .
this , he said , would add to data currently being collected by another canadian mission , called most , which is using a 15cm -lrb- 6in -rrb- telescope aboard a satellite to study the sky .
" corot will cover a large selection of stars - this is important because you need a good sample of different sorts of stars , with different properties and different ages , in order to understand stellar evolution . "
with the data it gains from the mission , particularly relating to earth-like planets , the team hopes to inform future space research .
in the second decade of this century , esa plans to launch the darwin flotilla - a fleet of four or five spacecraft that will hunt for earth-like planets around other stars and analyse their atmospheres for signs of extra-terrestrial life .
while us space agency nasa is to launch a terrestrial planet finder -lrb- tpf -rrb- mission which will also aim to locate earth-like worlds .
professor roxburgh told the bbc news website : " corot is a pioneer as far as planets are concerned .
" it will enable us to get knowledge of the sorts of stars that have planets and that sort of information will be needed for the next generation of missions searching for signs of habitable planets . " 1 .

corot will be the first spacecraft capable of detecting rocky planets just a few times bigger than earth that are orbiting neighbouring stars .
it will also uncover information on the stars themselves , determining their mass , age and chemical composition .
the multinational mission , led by the french space agency cnes , is due to launch on 27 december .
thien lam trong , corot project manager from cnes , said : " man has been thinking about other worlds since the beginning of astronomy .
corot will help us to understand whether earth-like exoplanets are a reality or dream . "
see the corot satellite the 650kg -lrb- 1,400lb -rrb- satellite will be launched on the soyuz-2-1b vehicle from the baikonur cosmodrome , kazakhstan , into a polar orbit 827km -lrb- 514 miles -rrb- above the earth .
corot carries a 27cm -lrb- 11in -rrb- telescope and a four-charge-coupled-device -lrb- ccd -rrb- camera , sensitive to tiny changes in the brightness of stars .
" there are two main science objectives for this mission , " said ian roxburgh , professor of astronomy at queen mary , university of london , who is the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- scientist on corot .
esa is a partner on corot along with austria , spain , germany , belgium and brazil .
and one of these , he said , would be to monitor about 60,000 stars to find some of the planets orbiting them .
" as a planet comes inbetween us , the observer , and the star , it goes across the front of the star and blocks out some of the light - this is called a transit , like the transit of venus .
" so we will be measuring the light from the stars , looking for decreases in brightness to detect if a planet is in orbit . "
the spacecraft will detect planets in transit across the stars -lrb- image : cnes -rrb- over a period of about 2.5 years , the satellite will focus on five to six different areas of the sky , each time for a duration of about 150 days .
every 512 seconds , it will measure the brightness of approximately 10,000 stars captured by the onboard camera , which employs the same technology as everyday digital cameras , allowing minute changes in the intensity of their light to be detected .
by measuring these contrasts , the scientists will be able to detect many different types of planets , from huge gaseous ones to small rocky planets .
but it is the smaller planets that are of most interest to the team .
while larger planets can be detected from the ground using a variety of techniques , explained professor roxburgh , planets nearing earth 's size can not .
corot will be the first spacecraft capable of finding them , he said .
" we should be able to get down to planets about twice as big as earth . "
the team are expecting to find between 10-40 of these smaller planets and tens of larger gaseous ones in each of the star fields the team observes .
star variety the other part of the mission is to find out more about the stars themselves .
by observing the subtle changes in light created as sound waves ripple through the star - a technique called asteroseismology -lrb- similar to seismology , which uses earthquake waves -rrb- - the team will be able to find out more about the body 's interior and determine its mass , age and chemical composition .
professor roxburgh said the team aimed to find out more about 60 of the brightest stars in the area of sky they are observing .
corot will reveal more about the interior of stars -lrb- image : cnes -rrb- this , he said , would add to data currently being collected by another canadian mission , called most , which is using a 15cm -lrb- 6in -rrb- telescope aboard a satellite to study the sky .
" corot will cover a large selection of stars - this is important because you need a good sample of different sorts of stars , with different properties and different ages , in order to understand stellar evolution . "
with the data it gains from the mission , particularly relating to earth-like planets , the team hopes to inform future space research .
in the second decade of this century , esa plans to launch the darwin flotilla - a fleet of four or five spacecraft that will hunt for earth-like planets around other stars and analyse their atmospheres for signs of extra-terrestrial life .
while us space agency nasa is to launch a terrestrial planet finder -lrb- tpf -rrb- mission which will also aim to locate earth-like worlds .
professor roxburgh told the bbc news website : " corot is a pioneer as far as planets are concerned .
" it will enable us to get knowledge of the sorts of stars that have planets and that sort of information will be needed for the next generation of missions searching for signs of habitable planets . " 1 .

click here to read about the schools that took part questions the albanian students were asked by the serbian students : question from serbian ivana at kosovska mitrovica gimnazija to albanian student , fjolla what are the most popular books and the greatest music hits ?
fjolla : the music that is listened to by the youth in south mitrovica is rock music , rap music , all kinds of music .
but the most popular for now is rock music .
i read love stories and science fiction .
my favourite book is tess of the d 'urbervilles by thomas hardy .
question from serbian svetlana at kosovska mitrovica gimnazija to albanian student , ardita can you tell us how you spend your evenings ?
ardita : in the evenings , mostly , we go to pubs and cafes .
we spend our time walking around , making new friends .
those are the things that we do most .
nothing special .
question from serbian maja at kosovska mitrovica gimnazija to albanian student , dastid how do you see the future generation ?
dastid : in my opinion , i see the next generation together because this is how it should have been .
i think it is better for us to get together .
let the politicians do their job and ourselves , the young people , let 's have fun .
the independence of kosovo , serbia , ex-yugoslavia or whatever is not for us to decide .
at least , i do not care .
i am young .
i want to be friends with you and with all the world because soon i will be an old person and have nothing to remember from my youth .
questions the serbian students were asked by the albanian students : question from albanian albana at frang bardhi high school to serbian student , maja would you be able to invite us to talk with you ?
maja : yes , of course , if we had an opportunity to meet up with you here or in your area , we would do it .
and we would be glad to see you and to work with you together in a group .
and that 's all .
question from albanian nevxhet at frang bardhi high school to serbian student , ivana what do you think we have in common ?
ivana : i think that we have a lot of things in common .
for example , when we finish school , we also go to coffee bars to have coffees or a juice .
we also go to see football games and other races .
i think things are pretty similar .
question from albanian fjolla at frang bardhi high school to serbian student , ivana what do you think would have been different if we were together in the same place today ?
ivana : talking is different when you are talking to someone like i am trying to do now .
but we do not have another solution , so ... so ... we are talking like this .
talking is easier of course when you 're able to look at someone .
but any solution is good when you have no choice .

frang bardhi high school and kosovska mitrovica gimnazija the high school in mitrovica was first established in 1919 as a school for girls .
soon after boys were admitted but they had separate classes .
mitrovica 's albanian majority live in the bigger southern part of the city at that time , 90 % of the pupils were serbian or montenegrin and classes were held exclusively in the serbian language .
after world war ii , classes in the albanian language were introduced and the number of albanian students steadily increased over the years until the 1980s when they became the majority of the student body .
throughout this period the classes in the two languages were separate , but under the same curriculum .
study of both the serbian and albanian language was mandatory .
things changed in 1990 when belgrade changed the constitution of serbia and reduced the autonomy of kosovo .
the albanians reacted by abandoning all state institutions which also meant that their students stopped going to the high school .
instead the albanians created a parallel school system with classes being held in private homes .
in the meantime serbian students continued going to the high school , which is located in the southern part of the city .
after nato 's intervention between march and june 1999 kosovska mitrovica became a divided town with the albanian majority living in the bigger southern part , and the serbs in the smaller northern part of the city .
the serbian minority live in the smaller northern part of the city the original high school building in the south started being used by albanian students after the nato intervention .
the high school was renamed frang bardhi high school and presently has exactly 2,000 students .

hungarians were shocked by the scenes of violence in budapest the bbc 's nick thorpe in budapest spoke to the head of the nine-member commission , professor katalin gonczol .
the panel was set up by prime minister ferenc gyurcsany , whose admission that the government had repeatedly lied about the ailing economy to win re-election triggered the mass protests .
katalin gonczol is not giving any more interviews .
as head of the commission she now sits in one of the hottest seats in hungary .
she spoke to the bbc just before the curtain of secrecy came down .
she is sensitive to the criticism already made , that the make-up of the commission is one-sided .
" my loyalty to the government is very low , i would say .
or none , " she laughs , a little nervously .
besides , she adds , seven out of the nine members are university professors .
" we have to go back each day or each week to the university , with a clear conscience to meet the students .
and they are the most critical group in hungary . "
country in crisis many hungarians , including president laszlo solyom , blame prime minister gyurcsany personally for what they call the moral crisis now afflicting hungary .
a safe parliamentary majority kept the pm in power will ms gonczol be able , on the basis of the evidence her team uncovers , to reveal any responsibility mr gyurcsany might bear ?
" this is not our job .
our recommendation could involve only a kind of advice to investigate responsibility , -lrb- of -rrb- a kind of profession , a kind of people , a kind of person . "
that answer will disappoint some critics of the commission in hungary .
" the prime minister emphasised that it is necessary to investigate the social-psychological background of what happened , " said constitutional lawyer istvan szikinger .
" i 'm afraid that the task of the commission may be some social explanation , instead of naming exactly who was responsible . "
ms gonczol insists she does have considerable access to information , including state secrets - although several key documents related to the disturbances have already been made secret by the government , for 30 and even 80 years .
" if it is unavoidable , and we need some or all , then we will certainly get the permission .
we will not be able to publish secrets .
but we can use the secrets in order to have the conclusion and the recommendation . "
police under scrutiny one of the most disputed questions in hungary today is over alleged police brutality on the worst day of the troubles , 23 october .
hungary 's pm accused protesters of " terrorising " budapest on that day , riot police fired hundreds of rounds of rubber bullets into the crowd , often at head level , and at short range .
two people were partially blinded , and dozens are suing the police for their injuries .
" i do n't know yet if there was police brutality , " says ms gonczol .
" perhaps there were some episodes .
we have to investigate that . " '
on that issue , her task may have been eased by a remarkable mea culpa by the hungarian police chief , laszlo bene , to foreign reporters in budapest on 29 november .
" we have seen scenes of police operations that clearly do not stand the test of legality , " general bene told the press .
" those officers guilty of misconduct or criminal violations during the policing of these events have proved to be unworthy of the profession .
and after their identification , they will be dishonourably discharged from the force . "
mainly on the basis of video footage , eight cases of police violence have been forwarded to the public prosecutor , gen bene said .
but the police themselves are having trouble identifying the men responsible , he admitted , because none wore identifying numbers on the day , and they were proving reluctant to break ranks and name those responsible .
scenes of riot police beating apparently defenceless people , already lying on the ground , were broadcast around the world .
apart from the police and public prosecutor , the gonczol commission has also appealed to four human rights organisations to provide evidence about the violence .
the commission will conduct no interviews with witnesses of its own , but will depend on information supplied by the prosecutor , police and the human rights groups .
but how will ms gonczol insulate her work from the bitterly divided social and political climate in hungary ?
she hopes , she says , that her work will " somehow shift these events away from the political arena , which is overheated " , and that the realm of facts , rather than emotions , will calm tempers .
the gonczol commission report is expected to be made public in early february .

hungarians were shocked by the scenes of violence in budapest the bbc 's nick thorpe in budapest spoke to the head of the nine-member commission , professor katalin gonczol .
the panel was set up by prime minister ferenc gyurcsany , whose admission that the government had repeatedly lied about the ailing economy to win re-election triggered the mass protests .
katalin gonczol is not giving any more interviews .
as head of the commission she now sits in one of the hottest seats in hungary .
she spoke to the bbc just before the curtain of secrecy came down .
she is sensitive to the criticism already made , that the make-up of the commission is one-sided .
" my loyalty to the government is very low , i would say .
or none , " she laughs , a little nervously .
besides , she adds , seven out of the nine members are university professors .
" we have to go back each day or each week to the university , with a clear conscience to meet the students .
and they are the most critical group in hungary . "
country in crisis many hungarians , including president laszlo solyom , blame prime minister gyurcsany personally for what they call the moral crisis now afflicting hungary .
a safe parliamentary majority kept the pm in power will ms gonczol be able , on the basis of the evidence her team uncovers , to reveal any responsibility mr gyurcsany might bear ?
" this is not our job .
our recommendation could involve only a kind of advice to investigate responsibility , -lrb- of -rrb- a kind of profession , a kind of people , a kind of person . "
that answer will disappoint some critics of the commission in hungary .
" the prime minister emphasised that it is necessary to investigate the social-psychological background of what happened , " said constitutional lawyer istvan szikinger .
" i 'm afraid that the task of the commission may be some social explanation , instead of naming exactly who was responsible . "
ms gonczol insists she does have considerable access to information , including state secrets - although several key documents related to the disturbances have already been made secret by the government , for 30 and even 80 years .
" if it is unavoidable , and we need some or all , then we will certainly get the permission .
we will not be able to publish secrets .
but we can use the secrets in order to have the conclusion and the recommendation . "
police under scrutiny one of the most disputed questions in hungary today is over alleged police brutality on the worst day of the troubles , 23 october .
hungary 's pm accused protesters of " terrorising " budapest on that day , riot police fired hundreds of rounds of rubber bullets into the crowd , often at head level , and at short range .
two people were partially blinded , and dozens are suing the police for their injuries .
" i do n't know yet if there was police brutality , " says ms gonczol .
" perhaps there were some episodes .
we have to investigate that . " '
on that issue , her task may have been eased by a remarkable mea culpa by the hungarian police chief , laszlo bene , to foreign reporters in budapest on 29 november .
" we have seen scenes of police operations that clearly do not stand the test of legality , " general bene told the press .
" those officers guilty of misconduct or criminal violations during the policing of these events have proved to be unworthy of the profession .
and after their identification , they will be dishonourably discharged from the force . "
mainly on the basis of video footage , eight cases of police violence have been forwarded to the public prosecutor , gen bene said .
but the police themselves are having trouble identifying the men responsible , he admitted , because none wore identifying numbers on the day , and they were proving reluctant to break ranks and name those responsible .

many thousands of homes were destroyed and hospitals are treating hundreds of injured after tuesday 's severe storm .
durian earlier hit the philippines as a typhoon , causing devastating mudslides that buried a number of villages in the bicol peninsula , south-east of manila .
the death toll has risen slightly to 543 , with 740 people still missing .
rescuers are working around the clock to open up supply lines to the worst affected areas around the mayon volcano in the luzon region .
machines have been brought in to shift tonnes of sand and volcanic rock to allow relief shipments to get through .
at least 250,000 homes are reported to have been destroyed or damaged , and power and water supplies remain cut off .
but despite a massive effort launched by president gloria arroyo to restore basic services by christmas , officials are warning the reconstruction could take years .
forced evacuation a clean-up is also underway , with officials saying more than 120,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed and some 700 fishing boats swept away .
at least 47 people have died in the south-central provinces of binh thuan , ba ria vung tau , ben tre and vinh long , officials said .
a further 49 are still missing , and more than 400 have been injured .
" the death toll could rise , " said pham nhat quang , a provincial military command spokesman .
" many of the victims are in very bad condition . "
there were no reports of flooding , despite warnings of a risk to the low-lying mekong delta area .
vietnamese authorities evacuated thousands of people from vulnerable areas before durian hit .
the bbc 's bill hayton , in hanoi , says the government 's decision to authorise local authorities to take all the means necessary to move people from the path of the storm may have saved lives .
though thousands left voluntarily , he reports , many were forcibly removed from their homes .
he says it is highly unusual for southern vietnam to experience such a storm in the month of december .
