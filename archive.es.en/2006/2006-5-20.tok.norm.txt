in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .
talk of cuts in holidays and christmas bonuses also infuriated public sector workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in stuttgart , garbage filled the streets at the height of the strike but the three-month dispute ended quietly in potsdam on friday evening , with union representatives acknowledging the need for more flexible labor conditions .
the deal reached affects public sector workers in 14 of germany 's federal states - berlin and hesse were excluded .
negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .
in the eastern states , the 40-hour week will remain in place , while many workers in the western states can expect to work less in future .
an across the board wage hike of 2.9 percent can first be expected in 2008 . doctors want own contract hartmut möllring , the head negotiator for 14 german states , said that he assumed the agreement also meant that the ongoing conflict with the country 's university clinic doctors had been resolved .

the marburger bund has demanded its own contract , better working conditions and higher salaries for doctors working in university clinics and state hospitals . on friday , thousands of doctors participated in nationwide walk-outs , escalating what has become the biggest healthcare sector strike germany has ever seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.05.2006 baltic sea ships switch to fuel to protect environment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : container ships in the baltic will be required to lower sulfur emissions the world 's sea lanes are congested , meaning more pollution is created .
cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .
talk of cuts in holidays and christmas bonuses also infuriated public sector workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in stuttgart , garbage filled the streets at the height of the strike but the three-month dispute ended quietly in potsdam on friday evening , with union representatives acknowledging the need for more flexible labor conditions .
the deal reached affects public sector workers in 14 of germany 's federal states - berlin and hesse were excluded .
negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .
in the eastern states , the 40-hour week will remain in place , while many workers in the western states can expect to work less in future .
an across the board wage hike of 2.9 percent can first be expected in 2008 . doctors want own contract hartmut möllring , the head negotiator for 14 german states , said that he assumed the agreement also meant that the ongoing conflict with the country 's university clinic doctors had been resolved . " we had already made the doctors a fair offer , " he told german public broadcaster ndr .
" this included the promise that a doctor in his or her first year would have 510 euros -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- more in their pocket than they do today . " however , the head of the marburger bund physicians ' union warned against trying to apply the new wage agreement to doctors .
the marburger bund has demanded its own contract , better working conditions and higher salaries for doctors working in university clinics and state hospitals . on friday , thousands of doctors participated in nationwide walk-outs , escalating what has become the biggest healthcare sector strike germany has ever seen . " we will have to consider exactly what we can do and what we have to do and one possibility would be for a closure of practices over a longer period of time , " maximilian zollner , the chairman of the nav-virchow-bund association , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government feels heat as public sector strikes rage public sector workers in 10 german states joined strikes against longer working hours monday in a conflict that has exposed divisions within chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .

mistrust of the 3 million muslims living in germany appears to be growing . in spite of official attempts to promote dialog among religions , distrust of islam continues to grow , with 60 percent of germans expecting tension between traditional german society and immigrants from muslim countries , according to an allensbach study commissioned by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " germans are increasingly of the opinion that a lasting , peaceful coexistence with the islamic world will not be possible , " the researchers said in the survey , released wednesday . some 56 percent of germans said they believed a " clash of cultures " already exists , partly a result of recent incidents that received a large amount of media attention , according to the survey 's authors elisabeth noelle and thomas petersen . germans less willing to show tolerance to muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' image of muslims has been getting worse since sept .
11 , 2001 the case of a berlin " honor killing , " a quarrel over two bonn students who wore burkas to school and discussions concerning increasing schoolyard violence among immigrant children have all made headlines in the german press recently . " in view of the diffuse feeling of being under threat , and the suspected intolerance of islam , the readiness of germans to show tolerance to the muslim faith is sinking , " noelle and petersen wrote . germans ' esteem for islam has been falling since the sept .

that amount was 10 percent higher than two years ago .
a majority , 71 percent , said they believed islam to be " intolerant , " up from 66 percent . when asked what they associate with the word " islam , " 91 percent of respondents connected the religion to the discrimination of women , and 61 percent called islam " undemocratic . "
eight percent of germans associated " peacefulness " with islam . willing to limit freedom of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans do n't believe a mosque should be built in a community that does n't want it about 40 percent of germans queried were willing to limit the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion if constricting the practice of the muslim religion would lead to fewer violent muslims choosing to live in germany .
over half of those who took part , 56 percent , agreed with the statement , " if some muslim countries forbid building churches , then it should be forbidden to build mosques here . " there was one result amid the responses that improved the mood of those working on intercultural dialog : two-thirds of germans said they believed islam does not pose a threat , but that radical , politically motivated individuals are behind extremist acts . the survey 's authors wrote that " there is a pattern of polarization " widening the gap between germans ' feelings of their own situation and " the others , " which could be the " beginning of a spiral of conflict . " " since the end of the world war ii , the german population has had a particular aversion to conflict , " noelle and petersen wrote .

the chancellor is expected to press beijing to take more global responsibility . angela merkel will urge china to play a bigger role in resolving world conflicts , german officials said ahead of her first visit to china since taking office .
in meetings with prime minister wen jiabao and president hu jintao , merkel will stress that china 's role as an emerging economic superpower must be accompanied by an increased effort in international diplomacy . " the economic role of china has grown and so has its responsibility on the international stage , " an official told the news agency afp , on condition of anonymity .
" based on its economic position , china must take on more responsibilities . " germany would like to see china involved more closely in the international efforts to solve the iranian nuclear crisis , for example .
china , a veto power in the un security council , has so far rejected threatening iran with sanctions .
along with britain , france and the united states , however , germany is in favor of a harsher approach that might include sanctions . " tactful " on human rights the issue of human rights will be raised " tactfully " with the chinese leadership , officials said .
merkel 's predecessors , helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , avoided bringing up human rights using the rationale that publicly highlighting the problems would n't lead to positive results .

representatives from a cross-section of chinese society have been invited to attend a reception at the german embassy in beijing . big business merkel will be accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of german business leaders and economics minister michael glos , reflecting china 's role as germany 's biggest trading partner in asia .
among the business deals expected to be finalized during the visit , lufthansa is set to put the finishing touches on air china 's admission to the star alliance network of airlines . german industry has called on merkel to use her trip to step up the war against counterfeit goods , which cost global industry around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year .

the german government justified the payments on the basis of the china 's high level of poverty - around 130 million people are said to live below the poverty level - and that the money was focused on projects that sparked german investment , according to reuters . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china masters german train technology , will cut costs china has mastered a key part of the german technology to build high-speed magnetic levitation trains and is now aiming to cut the costs of its new line by one third , according to state press .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .
talk of cuts in holidays and christmas bonuses also infuriated public sector workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in stuttgart , garbage filled the streets at the height of the strike but the three-month dispute ended quietly in potsdam on friday evening , with union representatives acknowledging the need for more flexible labor conditions .
the deal reached affects public sector workers in 14 of germany 's federal states - berlin and hesse were excluded .
negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .
in the eastern states , the 40-hour week will remain in place , while many workers in the western states can expect to work less in future .
an across the board wage hike of 2.9 percent can first be expected in 2008 . doctors want own contract hartmut möllring , the head negotiator for 14 german states , said that he assumed the agreement also meant that the ongoing conflict with the country 's university clinic doctors had been resolved . " we had already made the doctors a fair offer , " he told german public broadcaster ndr .
" this included the promise that a doctor in his or her first year would have 510 euros -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- more in their pocket than they do today . " however , the head of the marburger bund physicians ' union warned against trying to apply the new wage agreement to doctors .
the marburger bund has demanded its own contract , better working conditions and higher salaries for doctors working in university clinics and state hospitals . on friday , thousands of doctors participated in nationwide walk-outs , escalating what has become the biggest healthcare sector strike germany has ever seen . " we will have to consider exactly what we can do and what we have to do and one possibility would be for a closure of practices over a longer period of time , " maximilian zollner , the chairman of the nav-virchow-bund association , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government feels heat as public sector strikes rage public sector workers in 10 german states joined strikes against longer working hours monday in a conflict that has exposed divisions within chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .

mistrust of the 3 million muslims living in germany appears to be growing . in spite of official attempts to promote dialog among religions , distrust of islam continues to grow , with 60 percent of germans expecting tension between traditional german society and immigrants from muslim countries , according to an allensbach study commissioned by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " germans are increasingly of the opinion that a lasting , peaceful coexistence with the islamic world will not be possible , " the researchers said in the survey , released wednesday . some 56 percent of germans said they believed a " clash of cultures " already exists , partly a result of recent incidents that received a large amount of media attention , according to the survey 's authors elisabeth noelle and thomas petersen . germans less willing to show tolerance to muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' image of muslims has been getting worse since sept .
11 , 2001 the case of a berlin " honor killing , " a quarrel over two bonn students who wore burkas to school and discussions concerning increasing schoolyard violence among immigrant children have all made headlines in the german press recently . " in view of the diffuse feeling of being under threat , and the suspected intolerance of islam , the readiness of germans to show tolerance to the muslim faith is sinking , " noelle and petersen wrote . germans ' esteem for islam has been falling since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , with 83 percent of the 1,076 germans questioned in the survey agreeing with the statement that islam is driven by fanaticism .
that amount was 10 percent higher than two years ago .
a majority , 71 percent , said they believed islam to be " intolerant , " up from 66 percent . when asked what they associate with the word " islam , " 91 percent of respondents connected the religion to the discrimination of women , and 61 percent called islam " undemocratic . "
eight percent of germans associated " peacefulness " with islam . willing to limit freedom of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans do n't believe a mosque should be built in a community that does n't want it about 40 percent of germans queried were willing to limit the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion if constricting the practice of the muslim religion would lead to fewer violent muslims choosing to live in germany .
over half of those who took part , 56 percent , agreed with the statement , " if some muslim countries forbid building churches , then it should be forbidden to build mosques here . " there was one result amid the responses that improved the mood of those working on intercultural dialog : two-thirds of germans said they believed islam does not pose a threat , but that radical , politically motivated individuals are behind extremist acts . the survey 's authors wrote that " there is a pattern of polarization " widening the gap between germans ' feelings of their own situation and " the others , " which could be the " beginning of a spiral of conflict . " " since the end of the world war ii , the german population has had a particular aversion to conflict , " noelle and petersen wrote .
" but in regards to islam , the fronts are obviously getting harder . " rainer sollich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european imams stress social integration a conference of european imams ended in vienna on sunday with participants urging europe 's muslims and their religious leaders across the continent to take part in all aspects of society .
-lrb- april 10 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's not-quite-so-secular democracy religion still plays a significant role in german politics , despite an official separation of church and state .
up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing .
-lrb- march 28 , 2006 -rrb- in germany , veiled students stir up uniform debate a debate over whether to mandate school uniforms in germany broke out after two muslim girls were suspended from school in bonn for coming veiled from head to toe in a traditional opaque garb known as a burka .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .

the latest victim of a racist attack is one of their own - a german politician of turkish origin . giyasettin sayan , 56 , a member of berlin 's regional assembly who is of turkish origin is in hospital after being attacked by two men who called him a " dirty foreigner " , police said on saturday . sayan , who represents the neo-communist left party , suffered head injuries and bruising on friday after his attackers struck him with a bottle in a street in his lichtenberg ward in the east of the berlin . police are offering a 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 3,600 -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lichtenberg district is known for its far-right scene the lichtenberg district is known as a stronghold of neo-nazis in berlin , and sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack confirmed earlier warnings by a former government spokesman to world cup fans . incident follows warning to foreigners german politicians and football authorities reacted with anger on thursday to the warning from uwe-karsten heye that " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go . " " they may not leave with their lives , " heye added . marlene mortler , who chairs the tourism committee of the german parliament , said that , although isolated racially motivated attacks did take place , " germany is far from being a country where foreign visitors should fear attacks from the far-right . " the interior ministry for its part said it was confident that all the estimated one million visitors for the june 9 to july 9 world cup would feel safe . the high rate of unemployment in the former east germany has been blamed for helping neo-nazi , anti-immigration groups recruit young members . police chief against declaring " no-go " areas berlin police chief dieter glietsch is hoping for a swift resolution in the sayan attack .
he said that a six-person team was in pursuit of the politician 's assailants . however , glietch told reporters on saturday that , despite the attack on sayan , there was no justification for labelling certain berlin city districts " no-go " areas for dark-skinned foreigners .
that would be playing into the hands of the neo-nazis who would like that to be the case , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : fighting racism needs action , not words when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.05.2006 baltic sea ships switch to fuel to protect environment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : container ships in the baltic will be required to lower sulfur emissions the world 's sea lanes are congested , meaning more pollution is created .
cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

mistrust of the 3 million muslims living in germany appears to be growing . in spite of official attempts to promote dialog among religions , distrust of islam continues to grow , with 60 percent of germans expecting tension between traditional german society and immigrants from muslim countries , according to an allensbach study commissioned by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " germans are increasingly of the opinion that a lasting , peaceful coexistence with the islamic world will not be possible , " the researchers said in the survey , released wednesday . some 56 percent of germans said they believed a " clash of cultures " already exists , partly a result of recent incidents that received a large amount of media attention , according to the survey 's authors elisabeth noelle and thomas petersen . germans less willing to show tolerance to muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' image of muslims has been getting worse since sept .
11 , 2001 the case of a berlin " honor killing , " a quarrel over two bonn students who wore burkas to school and discussions concerning increasing schoolyard violence among immigrant children have all made headlines in the german press recently . " in view of the diffuse feeling of being under threat , and the suspected intolerance of islam , the readiness of germans to show tolerance to the muslim faith is sinking , " noelle and petersen wrote . germans ' esteem for islam has been falling since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , with 83 percent of the 1,076 germans questioned in the survey agreeing with the statement that islam is driven by fanaticism .
that amount was 10 percent higher than two years ago .
a majority , 71 percent , said they believed islam to be " intolerant , " up from 66 percent . when asked what they associate with the word " islam , " 91 percent of respondents connected the religion to the discrimination of women , and 61 percent called islam " undemocratic . "
eight percent of germans associated " peacefulness " with islam . willing to limit freedom of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans do n't believe a mosque should be built in a community that does n't want it about 40 percent of germans queried were willing to limit the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion if constricting the practice of the muslim religion would lead to fewer violent muslims choosing to live in germany .
over half of those who took part , 56 percent , agreed with the statement , " if some muslim countries forbid building churches , then it should be forbidden to build mosques here . " there was one result amid the responses that improved the mood of those working on intercultural dialog : two-thirds of germans said they believed islam does not pose a threat , but that radical , politically motivated individuals are behind extremist acts . the survey 's authors wrote that " there is a pattern of polarization " widening the gap between germans ' feelings of their own situation and " the others , " which could be the " beginning of a spiral of conflict . " " since the end of the world war ii , the german population has had a particular aversion to conflict , " noelle and petersen wrote .
" but in regards to islam , the fronts are obviously getting harder . " rainer sollich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european imams stress social integration a conference of european imams ended in vienna on sunday with participants urging europe 's muslims and their religious leaders across the continent to take part in all aspects of society .
-lrb- april 10 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's not-quite-so-secular democracy religion still plays a significant role in german politics , despite an official separation of church and state .
up to now , christian groups had the greatest say , but this is slowly changing .
-lrb- march 28 , 2006 -rrb- in germany , veiled students stir up uniform debate a debate over whether to mandate school uniforms in germany broke out after two muslim girls were suspended from school in bonn for coming veiled from head to toe in a traditional opaque garb known as a burka .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

mistrust of the 3 million muslims living in germany appears to be growing . in spite of official attempts to promote dialog among religions , distrust of islam continues to grow , with 60 percent of germans expecting tension between traditional german society and immigrants from muslim countries , according to an allensbach study commissioned by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " germans are increasingly of the opinion that a lasting , peaceful coexistence with the islamic world will not be possible , " the researchers said in the survey , released wednesday . some 56 percent of germans said they believed a " clash of cultures " already exists , partly a result of recent incidents that received a large amount of media attention , according to the survey 's authors elisabeth noelle and thomas petersen . germans less willing to show tolerance to muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' image of muslims has been getting worse since sept .

" in view of the diffuse feeling of being under threat , and the suspected intolerance of islam , the readiness of germans to show tolerance to the muslim faith is sinking , " noelle and petersen wrote . germans ' esteem for islam has been falling since the sept .

eight percent of germans associated " peacefulness " with islam . willing to limit freedom of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans do n't believe a mosque should be built in a community that does n't want it about 40 percent of germans queried were willing to limit the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion if constricting the practice of the muslim religion would lead to fewer violent muslims choosing to live in germany .
over half of those who took part , 56 percent , agreed with the statement , " if some muslim countries forbid building churches , then it should be forbidden to build mosques here . " there was one result amid the responses that improved the mood of those working on intercultural dialog : two-thirds of germans said they believed islam does not pose a threat , but that radical , politically motivated individuals are behind extremist acts . the survey 's authors wrote that " there is a pattern of polarization " widening the gap between germans ' feelings of their own situation and " the others , " which could be the " beginning of a spiral of conflict . " " since the end of the world war ii , the german population has had a particular aversion to conflict , " noelle and petersen wrote .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .
talk of cuts in holidays and christmas bonuses also infuriated public sector workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in stuttgart , garbage filled the streets at the height of the strike but the three-month dispute ended quietly in potsdam on friday evening , with union representatives acknowledging the need for more flexible labor conditions .
the deal reached affects public sector workers in 14 of germany 's federal states - berlin and hesse were excluded .
negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .
in the eastern states , the 40-hour week will remain in place , while many workers in the western states can expect to work less in future .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .

" the economic role of china has grown and so has its responsibility on the international stage , " an official told the news agency afp , on condition of anonymity .
" based on its economic position , china must take on more responsibilities . " germany would like to see china involved more closely in the international efforts to solve the iranian nuclear crisis , for example .
china , a veto power in the un security council , has so far rejected threatening iran with sanctions .
along with britain , france and the united states , however , germany is in favor of a harsher approach that might include sanctions . " tactful " on human rights the issue of human rights will be raised " tactfully " with the chinese leadership , officials said .

among the business deals expected to be finalized during the visit , lufthansa is set to put the finishing touches on air china 's admission to the star alliance network of airlines . german industry has called on merkel to use her trip to step up the war against counterfeit goods , which cost global industry around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .
talk of cuts in holidays and christmas bonuses also infuriated public sector workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in stuttgart , garbage filled the streets at the height of the strike but the three-month dispute ended quietly in potsdam on friday evening , with union representatives acknowledging the need for more flexible labor conditions .
the deal reached affects public sector workers in 14 of germany 's federal states - berlin and hesse were excluded .
negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .
in the eastern states , the 40-hour week will remain in place , while many workers in the western states can expect to work less in future .
an across the board wage hike of 2.9 percent can first be expected in 2008 . doctors want own contract hartmut möllring , the head negotiator for 14 german states , said that he assumed the agreement also meant that the ongoing conflict with the country 's university clinic doctors had been resolved . " we had already made the doctors a fair offer , " he told german public broadcaster ndr .
" this included the promise that a doctor in his or her first year would have 510 euros -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- more in their pocket than they do today . " however , the head of the marburger bund physicians ' union warned against trying to apply the new wage agreement to doctors .
the marburger bund has demanded its own contract , better working conditions and higher salaries for doctors working in university clinics and state hospitals . on friday , thousands of doctors participated in nationwide walk-outs , escalating what has become the biggest healthcare sector strike germany has ever seen . " we will have to consider exactly what we can do and what we have to do and one possibility would be for a closure of practices over a longer period of time , " maximilian zollner , the chairman of the nav-virchow-bund association , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government feels heat as public sector strikes rage public sector workers in 10 german states joined strikes against longer working hours monday in a conflict that has exposed divisions within chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.05.2006 baltic sea ships switch to fuel to protect environment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : container ships in the baltic will be required to lower sulfur emissions the world 's sea lanes are congested , meaning more pollution is created .
cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

the latest victim of a racist attack is one of their own - a german politician of turkish origin . giyasettin sayan , 56 , a member of berlin 's regional assembly who is of turkish origin is in hospital after being attacked by two men who called him a " dirty foreigner " , police said on saturday . sayan , who represents the neo-communist left party , suffered head injuries and bruising on friday after his attackers struck him with a bottle in a street in his lichtenberg ward in the east of the berlin . police are offering a 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 3,600 -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lichtenberg district is known for its far-right scene the lichtenberg district is known as a stronghold of neo-nazis in berlin , and sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack confirmed earlier warnings by a former government spokesman to world cup fans . incident follows warning to foreigners german politicians and football authorities reacted with anger on thursday to the warning from uwe-karsten heye that " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go . " " they may not leave with their lives , " heye added . marlene mortler , who chairs the tourism committee of the german parliament , said that , although isolated racially motivated attacks did take place , " germany is far from being a country where foreign visitors should fear attacks from the far-right . " the interior ministry for its part said it was confident that all the estimated one million visitors for the june 9 to july 9 world cup would feel safe . the high rate of unemployment in the former east germany has been blamed for helping neo-nazi , anti-immigration groups recruit young members . police chief against declaring " no-go " areas berlin police chief dieter glietsch is hoping for a swift resolution in the sayan attack .
he said that a six-person team was in pursuit of the politician 's assailants . however , glietch told reporters on saturday that , despite the attack on sayan , there was no justification for labelling certain berlin city districts " no-go " areas for dark-skinned foreigners .
that would be playing into the hands of the neo-nazis who would like that to be the case , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : fighting racism needs action , not words when a public figure warned dark-skinned people to avoid parts of eastern germany , he raised a new debate on racism .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .

negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .

mistrust of the 3 million muslims living in germany appears to be growing . in spite of official attempts to promote dialog among religions , distrust of islam continues to grow , with 60 percent of germans expecting tension between traditional german society and immigrants from muslim countries , according to an allensbach study commissioned by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " germans are increasingly of the opinion that a lasting , peaceful coexistence with the islamic world will not be possible , " the researchers said in the survey , released wednesday . some 56 percent of germans said they believed a " clash of cultures " already exists , partly a result of recent incidents that received a large amount of media attention , according to the survey 's authors elisabeth noelle and thomas petersen . germans less willing to show tolerance to muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' image of muslims has been getting worse since sept .
11 , 2001 the case of a berlin " honor killing , " a quarrel over two bonn students who wore burkas to school and discussions concerning increasing schoolyard violence among immigrant children have all made headlines in the german press recently . " in view of the diffuse feeling of being under threat , and the suspected intolerance of islam , the readiness of germans to show tolerance to the muslim faith is sinking , " noelle and petersen wrote . germans ' esteem for islam has been falling since the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , with 83 percent of the 1,076 germans questioned in the survey agreeing with the statement that islam is driven by fanaticism .
that amount was 10 percent higher than two years ago .
a majority , 71 percent , said they believed islam to be " intolerant , " up from 66 percent . when asked what they associate with the word " islam , " 91 percent of respondents connected the religion to the discrimination of women , and 61 percent called islam " undemocratic . "

that amount was 10 percent higher than two years ago .
a majority , 71 percent , said they believed islam to be " intolerant , " up from 66 percent . when asked what they associate with the word " islam , " 91 percent of respondents connected the religion to the discrimination of women , and 61 percent called islam " undemocratic . "
eight percent of germans associated " peacefulness " with islam . willing to limit freedom of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans do n't believe a mosque should be built in a community that does n't want it about 40 percent of germans queried were willing to limit the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion if constricting the practice of the muslim religion would lead to fewer violent muslims choosing to live in germany .
over half of those who took part , 56 percent , agreed with the statement , " if some muslim countries forbid building churches , then it should be forbidden to build mosques here . " there was one result amid the responses that improved the mood of those working on intercultural dialog : two-thirds of germans said they believed islam does not pose a threat , but that radical , politically motivated individuals are behind extremist acts . the survey 's authors wrote that " there is a pattern of polarization " widening the gap between germans ' feelings of their own situation and " the others , " which could be the " beginning of a spiral of conflict . " " since the end of the world war ii , the german population has had a particular aversion to conflict , " noelle and petersen wrote .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .
he said that freight customers will have to pay a fuel surcharge . in one year , shipping traffic on the north sea and the english canal will also have to make the switch to low-sulfur fuel . claudia thoma -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

the chancellor is expected to press beijing to take more global responsibility . angela merkel will urge china to play a bigger role in resolving world conflicts , german officials said ahead of her first visit to china since taking office .
in meetings with prime minister wen jiabao and president hu jintao , merkel will stress that china 's role as an emerging economic superpower must be accompanied by an increased effort in international diplomacy . " the economic role of china has grown and so has its responsibility on the international stage , " an official told the news agency afp , on condition of anonymity .
" based on its economic position , china must take on more responsibilities . " germany would like to see china involved more closely in the international efforts to solve the iranian nuclear crisis , for example .
china , a veto power in the un security council , has so far rejected threatening iran with sanctions .

the chancellor is expected to press beijing to take more global responsibility . angela merkel will urge china to play a bigger role in resolving world conflicts , german officials said ahead of her first visit to china since taking office .
in meetings with prime minister wen jiabao and president hu jintao , merkel will stress that china 's role as an emerging economic superpower must be accompanied by an increased effort in international diplomacy . " the economic role of china has grown and so has its responsibility on the international stage , " an official told the news agency afp , on condition of anonymity .
" based on its economic position , china must take on more responsibilities . " germany would like to see china involved more closely in the international efforts to solve the iranian nuclear crisis , for example .
china , a veto power in the un security council , has so far rejected threatening iran with sanctions .
along with britain , france and the united states , however , germany is in favor of a harsher approach that might include sanctions . " tactful " on human rights the issue of human rights will be raised " tactfully " with the chinese leadership , officials said .
merkel 's predecessors , helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , avoided bringing up human rights using the rationale that publicly highlighting the problems would n't lead to positive results .

the latest victim of a racist attack is one of their own - a german politician of turkish origin . giyasettin sayan , 56 , a member of berlin 's regional assembly who is of turkish origin is in hospital after being attacked by two men who called him a " dirty foreigner " , police said on saturday . sayan , who represents the neo-communist left party , suffered head injuries and bruising on friday after his attackers struck him with a bottle in a street in his lichtenberg ward in the east of the berlin . police are offering a 3,000 euro -lrb- $ 3,600 -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the assailants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lichtenberg district is known for its far-right scene the lichtenberg district is known as a stronghold of neo-nazis in berlin , and sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack confirmed earlier warnings by a former government spokesman to world cup fans . incident follows warning to foreigners german politicians and football authorities reacted with anger on thursday to the warning from uwe-karsten heye that " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go . " " they may not leave with their lives , " heye added . marlene mortler , who chairs the tourism committee of the german parliament , said that , although isolated racially motivated attacks did take place , " germany is far from being a country where foreign visitors should fear attacks from the far-right . " the interior ministry for its part said it was confident that all the estimated one million visitors for the june 9 to july 9 world cup would feel safe . the high rate of unemployment in the former east germany has been blamed for helping neo-nazi , anti-immigration groups recruit young members . police chief against declaring " no-go " areas berlin police chief dieter glietsch is hoping for a swift resolution in the sayan attack .
he said that a six-person team was in pursuit of the politician 's assailants . however , glietch told reporters on saturday that , despite the attack on sayan , there was no justification for labelling certain berlin city districts " no-go " areas for dark-skinned foreigners .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .
talk of cuts in holidays and christmas bonuses also infuriated public sector workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in stuttgart , garbage filled the streets at the height of the strike but the three-month dispute ended quietly in potsdam on friday evening , with union representatives acknowledging the need for more flexible labor conditions .
the deal reached affects public sector workers in 14 of germany 's federal states - berlin and hesse were excluded .
negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .
in the eastern states , the 40-hour week will remain in place , while many workers in the western states can expect to work less in future .
an across the board wage hike of 2.9 percent can first be expected in 2008 . doctors want own contract hartmut möllring , the head negotiator for 14 german states , said that he assumed the agreement also meant that the ongoing conflict with the country 's university clinic doctors had been resolved . " we had already made the doctors a fair offer , " he told german public broadcaster ndr .
" this included the promise that a doctor in his or her first year would have 510 euros -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- more in their pocket than they do today . " however , the head of the marburger bund physicians ' union warned against trying to apply the new wage agreement to doctors .
the marburger bund has demanded its own contract , better working conditions and higher salaries for doctors working in university clinics and state hospitals . on friday , thousands of doctors participated in nationwide walk-outs , escalating what has become the biggest healthcare sector strike germany has ever seen . " we will have to consider exactly what we can do and what we have to do and one possibility would be for a closure of practices over a longer period of time , " maximilian zollner , the chairman of the nav-virchow-bund association , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government feels heat as public sector strikes rage public sector workers in 10 german states joined strikes against longer working hours monday in a conflict that has exposed divisions within chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .

many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .

cargo ships use the dirtiest of all fuels with large amounts of sulfur .
now , the baltic sea should be protected from the pollutant . in germany , cars run on relatively clean fuel that is highly processed to reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion process .
gasoline is amber in color , a distillate hardly recognizable from its original fossil fuel - crude oil . the fuel that cargo ships around the world use to fire their powerful engines comes from what are literally the dregs of the oil refining process .
the asphalt-colored substance is so thick that it must be mixed with heating oil so that its viscosity is low enough to be pumped .
in the syrup-like fuel , there is a large amount of sulfur - up to 4.5 percent . when burnt , much of this sulfur in the form of sulfuric dioxide is emitted from ships ' smokestacks .
it then dissolves in the water , creating sulfuric acid .
this in turn strongly increases the water 's acidity levels . " sulfuric acid is a strong acid , " said karin lochte , a professor at the leibniz institute for marine sciences in kiel .
" for one , when you compare it with carbonic acid , the effect of sulfuric acid is stronger .
secondly , the sulfuric dioxide creates little condensation particles in the atmosphere , thus building more clouds . " the product of that process is acid rain . baltic sea suffers more tha n other large bodies of water the baltic sea is comparable to a large lake .
the narrow bay between denmark and sweden , called the kattegat , prevents an exchange of water in a way similar to what happens in the world 's oceans or even the north sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising shipping traffic has put pressure on the marine ecosystem to prevent further acidification in the baltic , ships navigating the sea must burn fuel with sulfur amounts of 1.5 percent or less .
many ships , however , do not remain solely in the baltic sea , but are exiting it through the kattegat to the north sea and beyond , where the higher sulfur fuel is not forbidden .
thus , the question for much of the shipping industry on the baltic is whether or not to refit ships and bunker stations , the name for marine fuelling stations , with an additional tank specifically for low-sulfur fuel . a second tank means additional costs according to bunker station owner werner schlüter .
he is talking with ship owners to see what they think and is holding off installing another tank for the time being . new regulatio n drives fuel price higher the environmental rule has an economical price to it .
in rotterdam , where fuel futures are traded , the price of low-sulfur fuel costs $ 30 -lrb- 23.3 euros -rrb- per ton more than its high-sulfur counterpart , and the gap between the two is increasing .
considering that a container ship can take up to 12,000 tons on board , the price makes a difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry operators face higher fuel prices the operator of the stena line that runs five ferry routes on the baltic sea had already switched to low-sulfur fuel .
despite rising costs , passengers will not pay more according to ulrich kock , head of the ferry line 's operations in germany .

the chancellor is expected to press beijing to take more global responsibility . angela merkel will urge china to play a bigger role in resolving world conflicts , german officials said ahead of her first visit to china since taking office .
in meetings with prime minister wen jiabao and president hu jintao , merkel will stress that china 's role as an emerging economic superpower must be accompanied by an increased effort in international diplomacy . " the economic role of china has grown and so has its responsibility on the international stage , " an official told the news agency afp , on condition of anonymity .
" based on its economic position , china must take on more responsibilities . " germany would like to see china involved more closely in the international efforts to solve the iranian nuclear crisis , for example .
china , a veto power in the un security council , has so far rejected threatening iran with sanctions .
along with britain , france and the united states , however , germany is in favor of a harsher approach that might include sanctions . " tactful " on human rights the issue of human rights will be raised " tactfully " with the chinese leadership , officials said .
merkel 's predecessors , helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , avoided bringing up human rights using the rationale that publicly highlighting the problems would n't lead to positive results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier prepared the way for merkel in february merkel will also meet with 91-year-old catholic bishop aloysius jin in shanghai and make a case for religious freedom , reuters reported . during merkel 's visit , justice minister brigitte zypries will host a chinese-german human rights forum set up by former chancellor schröder , a frequent visitor to china in his seven years in office .
representatives from a cross-section of chinese society have been invited to attend a reception at the german embassy in beijing . big business merkel will be accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of german business leaders and economics minister michael glos , reflecting china 's role as germany 's biggest trading partner in asia .
among the business deals expected to be finalized during the visit , lufthansa is set to put the finishing touches on air china 's admission to the star alliance network of airlines . german industry has called on merkel to use her trip to step up the war against counterfeit goods , which cost global industry around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants china to do more to prevent counterfeiting " the government must represent the interests of german industry more vigorously in china , " said apm , the anti-piracy arm of the dihk federation of chambers of commerce . an agreement between german and chinese textile industry representatives against product piracy that would punish companies that make counterfeit textiles is expected to be signed during merkel 's visit . germany pays china 65 million euros in development aid each year , despite the fact that the country has the world 's fourth biggest economy .
the german government justified the payments on the basis of the china 's high level of poverty - around 130 million people are said to live below the poverty level - and that the money was focused on projects that sparked german investment , according to reuters . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china masters german train technology , will cut costs china has mastered a key part of the german technology to build high-speed magnetic levitation trains and is now aiming to cut the costs of its new line by one third , according to state press .

the chancellor is expected to press beijing to take more global responsibility . angela merkel will urge china to play a bigger role in resolving world conflicts , german officials said ahead of her first visit to china since taking office .
in meetings with prime minister wen jiabao and president hu jintao , merkel will stress that china 's role as an emerging economic superpower must be accompanied by an increased effort in international diplomacy . " the economic role of china has grown and so has its responsibility on the international stage , " an official told the news agency afp , on condition of anonymity .
" based on its economic position , china must take on more responsibilities . " germany would like to see china involved more closely in the international efforts to solve the iranian nuclear crisis , for example .
china , a veto power in the un security council , has so far rejected threatening iran with sanctions .
along with britain , france and the united states , however , germany is in favor of a harsher approach that might include sanctions . " tactful " on human rights the issue of human rights will be raised " tactfully " with the chinese leadership , officials said .
merkel 's predecessors , helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , avoided bringing up human rights using the rationale that publicly highlighting the problems would n't lead to positive results .

in some cities , garbage was left to pile up in the street , and kindergartens and day care centers were shut .
in hospitals across the country , non-urgent operations were postponed as doctors and clinic workers took to the streets in protest of poor working conditions .
the conflict began in february after state employers attempted to increase the number of working hours per week from 38.5 to 40 without additional pay .
talk of cuts in holidays and christmas bonuses also infuriated public sector workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in stuttgart , garbage filled the streets at the height of the strike but the three-month dispute ended quietly in potsdam on friday evening , with union representatives acknowledging the need for more flexible labor conditions .
the deal reached affects public sector workers in 14 of germany 's federal states - berlin and hesse were excluded .
negotiators said the deal will allow the number of working hours per week to vary between 38.5 and 40 hours depending on the worker 's income and which state they live in .
in the eastern states , the 40-hour week will remain in place , while many workers in the western states can expect to work less in future .
an across the board wage hike of 2.9 percent can first be expected in 2008 . doctors want own contract hartmut möllring , the head negotiator for 14 german states , said that he assumed the agreement also meant that the ongoing conflict with the country 's university clinic doctors had been resolved .

" this included the promise that a doctor in his or her first year would have 510 euros -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- more in their pocket than they do today . " however , the head of the marburger bund physicians ' union warned against trying to apply the new wage agreement to doctors .
the marburger bund has demanded its own contract , better working conditions and higher salaries for doctors working in university clinics and state hospitals . on friday , thousands of doctors participated in nationwide walk-outs , escalating what has become the biggest healthcare sector strike germany has ever seen . " we will have to consider exactly what we can do and what we have to do and one possibility would be for a closure of practices over a longer period of time , " maximilian zollner , the chairman of the nav-virchow-bund association , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government feels heat as public sector strikes rage public sector workers in 10 german states joined strikes against longer working hours monday in a conflict that has exposed divisions within chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .

" based on its economic position , china must take on more responsibilities . " germany would like to see china involved more closely in the international efforts to solve the iranian nuclear crisis , for example .
china , a veto power in the un security council , has so far rejected threatening iran with sanctions .
along with britain , france and the united states , however , germany is in favor of a harsher approach that might include sanctions . " tactful " on human rights the issue of human rights will be raised " tactfully " with the chinese leadership , officials said .

among the business deals expected to be finalized during the visit , lufthansa is set to put the finishing touches on air china 's admission to the star alliance network of airlines . german industry has called on merkel to use her trip to step up the war against counterfeit goods , which cost global industry around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year .

the german government justified the payments on the basis of the china 's high level of poverty - around 130 million people are said to live below the poverty level - and that the money was focused on projects that sparked german investment , according to reuters . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china masters german train technology , will cut costs china has mastered a key part of the german technology to build high-speed magnetic levitation trains and is now aiming to cut the costs of its new line by one third , according to state press .

the general medical council struck sir roy off the medical register after he gave mistaken evidence at a 1999 trial .
the high court reversed the ruling , saying doctors could not be barred for making mistakes as expert witnesses .
lord goldsmith has asked for permission to support the gmc 's right to take disciplinary action in such cases , saying it is in the public interest .
the hearing will not affect sir roy 's position but will focus on the gmc 's ability to consider similar cases in future . "
people need to know that when experts go into court , they 're there to help the court " lord goldsmith " i do n't think in principle the judge is right to say the person who decides whether or not somebody has broken their own professional code is the judge , " lord goldsmith told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" it must be , i believe , for the regulating bodies in the final analysis to decide whether somebody has broken that code " .
professional boundaries prof meadow gave evidence at the trial of sally clark , who was arrested in 1998 after the deaths of her two sons , christopher and harry .
he told a chester crown court jury there was a " one in 73 million " chance of two children dying from cot deaths in an affluent family .
mrs clark 's conviction was later quashed in the court of appeal on grounds unrelated to professor meadow 's evidence .
in february lord goldsmith ordered a review of all infant death convictions since 1994 , including 88 involving allegations of shaken baby syndrome .
lord goldsmith told the bbc : " people need to know that when experts go into court , they 're there to help the court and that if they exceed proper professional boundaries they may be subject to disciplinary action by their professional bodies . "
after february 's ruling on the gmc 's action lord goldsmith said he believed the decision was " wrong in principle " but that he was " not taking sides over whether prof meadow was or was not guilty of serious professional misconduct " .
the high court hearing before mr justice collins ruled not only was the gmc unjustified in making a finding of serious professional misconduct last summer , it had no right to pursue the complaint in the first place .
the judge said expert witnesses who give evidence to courts must be immune from any disciplinary action - save in exceptional circumstances - so that they are not deterred from coming forward .
he said it was " quite unnecessary " to erase from the medical register someone like prof meadow who he described as a first-class paediatrician to whom many families owed much over his dealing with their children .

the general medical council struck sir roy off the medical register after he gave mistaken evidence at a 1999 trial .
the high court reversed the ruling , saying doctors could not be barred for making mistakes as expert witnesses .
lord goldsmith has asked for permission to support the gmc 's right to take disciplinary action in such cases , saying it is in the public interest .
the hearing will not affect sir roy 's position but will focus on the gmc 's ability to consider similar cases in future .
people need to know that when experts go into court , they 're there to help the court lord goldsmith today interview " i do n't think in principle the judge is right to say the person who decides whether or not somebody has broken their own professional code is the judge , " lord goldsmith told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" it must be , i believe , for the regulating bodies in the final analysis to decide whether somebody has broken that code " .
professional boundaries prof meadow gave evidence at the trial of sally clark , who was arrested in 1998 after the deaths of her two sons , christopher and harry .
he told a chester crown court jury there was a " one in 73 million " chance of two children dying from cot deaths in an affluent family .
mrs clark 's conviction was later quashed in the court of appeal on grounds unrelated to professor meadow 's evidence .
in february lord goldsmith ordered a review of all infant death convictions since 1994 , including 88 involving allegations of shaken baby syndrome .
lord goldsmith told the bbc : " people need to know that when experts go into court , they 're there to help the court and that if they exceed proper professional boundaries they may be subject to disciplinary action by their professional bodies . "
after february 's ruling on the gmc 's action lord goldsmith said he believed the decision was " wrong in principle " but that he was " not taking sides over whether prof meadow was or was not guilty of serious professional misconduct " .
the high court hearing before mr justice collins ruled not only was the gmc unjustified in making a finding of serious professional misconduct last summer , it had no right to pursue the complaint in the first place .
the judge said expert witnesses who give evidence to courts must be immune from any disciplinary action - save in exceptional circumstances - so that they are not deterred from coming forward .
he said it was " quite unnecessary " to erase from the medical register someone like prof meadow who he described as a first-class paediatrician to whom many families owed much over his dealing with their children .

under the regional assembly 's 20-year plan , west sussex will take 1.6 million tons between 2006 and 2015 and one million tons between 2015 and 2025 .
nine councils across the south east take the city 's waste for landfill .
west sussex council said the figures would be challenged , while the assembly said london 's waste was being reduced and the south east did not take it all .
the south east plan states that there are currently " significant " movements of waste to other regions of the country .
where london 's waste may go berkshire 8.5 % buckinghamshire 16.8 % east sussex 8.4 % hampshire 8.4 % kent and medway 12.2 % milton keynes 10.1 % oxfordshire 17.0 % surrey 8.4 % west sussex 10.1 % but it continues : " the south east is also a major importer of waste , mostly from london , with a smaller amount from the south west . "
exports from london into the south east of municipal , commercial and industrial waste are estimated at about 1.8 million tons per year , according to the plan .
west sussex councillor frank wilkinson said opposing the plan would be " one of his crusades " .
he said : " having to deal with london 's waste will undermine the county council 's efforts to deal with the county 's own waste mountain .

the former led zeppelin frontman returned to rockfield , near monmouth , to mark the 25th anniversary of his debut album after the group broke up .
he was reunited with guitarist robbie blunt and keyboard player jez woodruffe for a book on the studio .
plant said : " rockfield was an absolute dream because it was pastoral , funny and had a fantastic musical history . "
i moved here and became one of these dismal , happy , sad , failed musicians that other people cross the street to avoid robert plant the visit was arranged by journalist jeff collins , who is compiling a history of the studio , which was founded in the mid-1960s by brothers kingsley and charles ward .
plant , 57 , recalled how he arrived at rockfield 25 years ago this week , in the wake of zeppelin 's split following the death of the band 's drummer john bonham .
but he told collins he had not been sure he would make the transition from globe-trotting rock star to a musician with a solo career .
he said : " as far as expectation went , i mean at the age of 32 when your career is finished , anything that came after that was a bonus really .
rockfield was founded by the music-loving ward brothers " i really enjoyed my being in this rockfield environment .
i had lived in this goldfish bowl in led zeppelin .
" all we knew about were shadowy figures that came in the night with bags of gear , and security blokes , so it was fantastic to come here and find this whole culture -lsb- of musicians -rsb- around monmouth .
" you 'd go down to the nag 's head pub in the town -lsb- the olde nags head , in granville street -rsb- and come wobbling back up here .
enhanced credibility " so i moved here and became one of these dismal , happy , sad , failed musicians that other people cross the street to avoid . "
plant recorded two albums at rockfield , pictures at eleven in 1981 , released in june 1982 , and principle of moments two years later .
together again : -lrb- l-r -rrb- robbie blunt , jez woodruffe and robert plant former genesis star phil collins drummed on both , but could not make the reunion as he was in new york writing a musical for disney .
he sent his apologies .
kingsley and charles ward , who had their own music " combo " , created rockfield because they thought it would be easier than travelling to london , the nearest place with studios at that time .
music folklore records how in 1975 queen 's freddie mercury wrote his piano part for bohemian rhapsody in a former feed store at the farm while the rest of the band played frisbee in a nearby field .
but it was plant 's decision to record at rockfield which gave the studios enhanced credibility with generations of musicians , said jeff collins .
he said : " of all the artists that have worked there , the person most talked about is robert plant , having been in one of the world 's biggest and most successful bands .
" a lot of musicians have seen that his albums were recorded at rockfield and thought , ' if it was good enough for him , it 's good enough for me ' . "
plant 's 2006 schedule includes gigs in milan and the usa at the end of may and june and a one-off performance with former led zeppelin guitarist jimmy page at the montreux festival in july .

the reservoir created by the dam has already displaced more than a million people .
another 80,000 are still to be moved as it reaches its final stages .
some estimates say at least 1,200 villages and two major towns have had to be abandoned and rebuilt .
from the start , the central government promised cash compensation for all those forced to move .
it also promised them new homes and new livelihoods .
but that process has been highly controversial .
many families complained that much , in some cases most , of the compensation due to them was siphoned off by corrupt local bureaucrats .
official accounts seem to support their complaints that millions of dollars have been embezzled .
the chinese media has reported that some officials have been investigated for corruption - but the complaints continue .
precedent to some , the dam illustrates the ability of the chinese government to forge ahead with audacious multibillion dollar projects , heralded as in the long-term good of the nation , but with devastating consequences for local communities who remain largely voiceless .
those trying to highlight concerns about the social impact of the three gorges dam are also worried about the precedent it sets .
the chinese government sees it as a focus for national pride .
it may also prove a model for further big dam projects , part of the country 's struggle to meet its growing energy needs .
if the rights of these villagers are not respected , say activists , there is no reason to expect the rights of other displaced communities in the future to be any better safeguarded .
the three gorges dam type : concrete gravity dam cost : official cost $ 25bn - actual cost believed to be much higher work began : 1993 due for completion : 2009 power generation : 26 turbines on left and right sides of dam .
