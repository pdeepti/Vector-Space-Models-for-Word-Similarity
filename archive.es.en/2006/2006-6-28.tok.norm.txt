" for these is countries , it is a bit like a mini-eu , " said ferran taradellas espuny , spokesman for the directorate-general for energy and transportation , who said an agreement is expected to be ratified by the end of june and participating countries would like to begin converting a month later .

as a result , the pact prescribes exactly in detail what must be done , said paul rübig , a member of the european parliament who works on energy issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices should decrease with successful liberalization , says paul rübig " in the treaty , it states essentially that the energy efficiency is to be improved , " he said .
" that essentially means that buildings must insulate light fixtures and improve other infrastructure .
and more renewable energy needs to be used . " a new general secretariat will monitor whether the participating countries are following the rules of the accord .
it is going to cost about 20 billion euros in order to fulfil the terms of the agreement .

but rübig says that such liberalization does n't automatically mean higher prices . " according to the concept that is currently on the table , there will be a new energy mix .
that means that there will also be competition .
and we have in the eu established that overall , where liberalization functions well , prices go down . " energy in the region is essentially produced by hydropower , coal , and natural gas .

" in the classic media sector this kind of concentration would be unthinkable , " he said tuesday , after a two-day conference in berlin .
" it is important not to let this power develop unobserved . " google have a responsibility similar to other publishers not to allow access to illegal sites , such as those with neo-nazi content , which is illegal in germany , machill said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is on nearly 70 percent of germans ' screens when they want information making the search results transparent search engine operators ' german subsidiaries agreed to voluntarily filter sites with x-rated content or that glorify violence out of their results lists last year .
government needs to stay aware how the search companies operate and regulate them if needed , machill added . the voluntary obligation to filter sites amounts to nothing more than a " weak regulation without any sanctions , " according to norbert schneider , director of the north rhine westphalia state media institute .
he added it is up to government to make the power of search engines clear to internet users . machill also suggested starting a publicly funded european counterweight to the three us search engines that would level the search engine playing field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislation can influence what appears in search results google : we follow local laws there is no reason for added regulation or to fear explicit manipulation of search results because they are determined by a mathematical formula , according to google spokesperson stefan keuchel , adding that the only results that can be bought are labelled as advertisements . google and yahoo representatives , who for reasons of competition refuse to publish the formula that determines their search results , said they adhere to local laws when determining what results appear . " we believe in freedom of expression , not censorship , " keuchel said . both companies have , however , come under heavy fire from free speech organizations for censoring search results in china , where sites dealing with the tiananmen square massacre , tibet and independent news are censored under chinese laws . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders digitalization of cultural heritage how should european cultural heritage be preserved in the age of the internet ?

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .
italy and spain complained long and hard that refereeing decisions went against them in asia . asian soccer , especially , has suffered a setback in germany . asian soccer stalls in germany japan reached the last 16 in 2002 under the disciplinarian coach philippe troussier , but its players have failed to make major inroads into the major european clubs . after crashing out in the first round in germany , japan 's current coach zico , a star of brazil in the 1980s , said more japanese players needed to play abroad if the national team were to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico 's countrymen humiliated his japan team " we can not be successful in the world cup with our abilities limited to the level of asia , " zico said . but with europe and south america dominating club soccer , perhaps it is no surprise that national sides from those countries have re-asserted their dominance . not everyone was fooled in 2002 . the veteran american goalkeeper brad friedel , a seasoned english premiership player , was asked after his side 's elimination to eventual finalists germany in the quarter-finals if he believed the united states had finally arrived as a soccer power . he paused and smiled .

but this time the game is so much better placed to take its rightful place among the mainstream of australian sports . soccer , so long largely the domain of australia 's sizeable immigrant communities , has seized the national consciousness with thousands staying up into the early hours of the morning , following the socceroos on television , either at home , in pubs or at large outdoor venues . the australians ' unforgettable come-from-behind win over asian champions japan , outplaying world champions brazil for long periods in a 2-0 loss and their late equalizer with croatia to advance to the second round captivated the home audience . it may have ended bitterly with defender lucas neill , for many australia 's player of the tournament , judged to have brought down fabio grosso for italy 's gut-wrenching penalty , but the die has been cast back home . australia 's domestic league inundated with registrations bildunterschrift : australia 's a-league clubs are reporting keen demand for membership tickets for the new domestic season , which kicks off on august 26 with several of the old guard socceroos expected to return home from europe and play out their careers . the saturation media coverage pushed all of the other codes - such as australian rules , rugby union and rugby league - off the front and back pages while broadcaster sbs television enjoyed massive ratings for its early morning match telecasts . one pressing problem for football federation australia is who will replace the irreplaceable guus hiddink as national coach . dutch master hiddink leaves legacy but also a gaping hole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guus hiddink leaves a confident team on the brink recruited at considerable expense 11 months ago , the master dutch coach transformed the australian national team into a confident passing team which more than matched much higher-ranked opponents at the world cup . hiddink , who now becomes russia 's head coach , instilled a sense of belief into the australian players , along with a much-needed tactical and technical organization and a team bond that was obviously apparent in their matches in germany . australian officials , greatly impressed by hiddink 's influence , want another high-profile international coach to take the socceroos further . australia can expect to improve considerably on its 42nd rating when fifa issue its next rankings after the world cup . socceroos focus on next step into the big league australia 's next international incursion will be qualifying for the 2007 asian cup finals and beyond that the 2008 beijing olympics before attempting to gate-crash another world cup party in south africa in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craig moore and others will make way for a new generation by that stage many of australia 's long-established stars , among them skipper mark viduka , craig moore , mark schwarzer and john aloisi , will have left the national team , but the challenge will be to unearth new young talent and nurture them towards the next world cup . an extraordinary world cup statistic is that australia only led in a match for three minutes in their six hours ' of playing time in germany . yet despite all of that , the socceroos were a few seconds away from taking flagging 10-man italy into extra time and probable victory for a place in the last eight . australian soccer has come a long way in a very short space of time and the challenge now is to take it to the next level , both domestically and internationally . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in australia 's little italy , loyalties clash ahead of match norton street , in the heart of sydney 's little italy , has undergone an unprecedented green-and-gold transformation before the socceroos ' knockout clash with italy in the world cup second-round .

in the last few months , taliban forces have carried out increasing numbers of suicide attacks and the overall security situation in afghanistan has become decidedly worse over the that period of time . the bundeswehr took over the regional command of the nato isaf peacekeeping force in northern afghanistan on june 1 and currently there are just under 2,800 germany soldiers on the force .
thus far , 18 have been killed on the isaf mission . broader mandate after the attack , the afghan minister of economics , armin farhang , called on a broader mandate for the bundeswehr in afghanistan .

they should shake things up more and not just observe .
otherwise , they 'll be attacked . " according to him , the taliban has reorganized itself and developed new strategies to fight western forces in the country . although northern afghanistan has been seen until now as relatively peaceful , in southern afghanistan , the security situation has been much more serious .

but this time the game is so much better placed to take its rightful place among the mainstream of australian sports . soccer , so long largely the domain of australia 's sizeable immigrant communities , has seized the national consciousness with thousands staying up into the early hours of the morning , following the socceroos on television , either at home , in pubs or at large outdoor venues . the australians ' unforgettable come-from-behind win over asian champions japan , outplaying world champions brazil for long periods in a 2-0 loss and their late equalizer with croatia to advance to the second round captivated the home audience . it may have ended bitterly with defender lucas neill , for many australia 's player of the tournament , judged to have brought down fabio grosso for italy 's gut-wrenching penalty , but the die has been cast back home . australia 's domestic league inundated with registrations bildunterschrift : australia 's a-league clubs are reporting keen demand for membership tickets for the new domestic season , which kicks off on august 26 with several of the old guard socceroos expected to return home from europe and play out their careers . the saturation media coverage pushed all of the other codes - such as australian rules , rugby union and rugby league - off the front and back pages while broadcaster sbs television enjoyed massive ratings for its early morning match telecasts . one pressing problem for football federation australia is who will replace the irreplaceable guus hiddink as national coach . dutch master hiddink leaves legacy but also a gaping hole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guus hiddink leaves a confident team on the brink recruited at considerable expense 11 months ago , the master dutch coach transformed the australian national team into a confident passing team which more than matched much higher-ranked opponents at the world cup . hiddink , who now becomes russia 's head coach , instilled a sense of belief into the australian players , along with a much-needed tactical and technical organization and a team bond that was obviously apparent in their matches in germany . australian officials , greatly impressed by hiddink 's influence , want another high-profile international coach to take the socceroos further . australia can expect to improve considerably on its 42nd rating when fifa issue its next rankings after the world cup . socceroos focus on next step into the big league australia 's next international incursion will be qualifying for the 2007 asian cup finals and beyond that the 2008 beijing olympics before attempting to gate-crash another world cup party in south africa in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craig moore and others will make way for a new generation by that stage many of australia 's long-established stars , among them skipper mark viduka , craig moore , mark schwarzer and john aloisi , will have left the national team , but the challenge will be to unearth new young talent and nurture them towards the next world cup . an extraordinary world cup statistic is that australia only led in a match for three minutes in their six hours ' of playing time in germany . yet despite all of that , the socceroos were a few seconds away from taking flagging 10-man italy into extra time and probable victory for a place in the last eight . australian soccer has come a long way in a very short space of time and the challenge now is to take it to the next level , both domestically and internationally . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in australia 's little italy , loyalties clash ahead of match norton street , in the heart of sydney 's little italy , has undergone an unprecedented green-and-gold transformation before the socceroos ' knockout clash with italy in the world cup second-round .

but this time the game is so much better placed to take its rightful place among the mainstream of australian sports . soccer , so long largely the domain of australia 's sizeable immigrant communities , has seized the national consciousness with thousands staying up into the early hours of the morning , following the socceroos on television , either at home , in pubs or at large outdoor venues . the australians ' unforgettable come-from-behind win over asian champions japan , outplaying world champions brazil for long periods in a 2-0 loss and their late equalizer with croatia to advance to the second round captivated the home audience . it may have ended bitterly with defender lucas neill , for many australia 's player of the tournament , judged to have brought down fabio grosso for italy 's gut-wrenching penalty , but the die has been cast back home . australia 's domestic league inundated with registrations bildunterschrift : australia 's a-league clubs are reporting keen demand for membership tickets for the new domestic season , which kicks off on august 26 with several of the old guard socceroos expected to return home from europe and play out their careers . the saturation media coverage pushed all of the other codes - such as australian rules , rugby union and rugby league - off the front and back pages while broadcaster sbs television enjoyed massive ratings for its early morning match telecasts . one pressing problem for football federation australia is who will replace the irreplaceable guus hiddink as national coach . dutch master hiddink leaves legacy but also a gaping hole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guus hiddink leaves a confident team on the brink recruited at considerable expense 11 months ago , the master dutch coach transformed the australian national team into a confident passing team which more than matched much higher-ranked opponents at the world cup . hiddink , who now becomes russia 's head coach , instilled a sense of belief into the australian players , along with a much-needed tactical and technical organization and a team bond that was obviously apparent in their matches in germany . australian officials , greatly impressed by hiddink 's influence , want another high-profile international coach to take the socceroos further . australia can expect to improve considerably on its 42nd rating when fifa issue its next rankings after the world cup . socceroos focus on next step into the big league australia 's next international incursion will be qualifying for the 2007 asian cup finals and beyond that the 2008 beijing olympics before attempting to gate-crash another world cup party in south africa in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craig moore and others will make way for a new generation by that stage many of australia 's long-established stars , among them skipper mark viduka , craig moore , mark schwarzer and john aloisi , will have left the national team , but the challenge will be to unearth new young talent and nurture them towards the next world cup . an extraordinary world cup statistic is that australia only led in a match for three minutes in their six hours ' of playing time in germany . yet despite all of that , the socceroos were a few seconds away from taking flagging 10-man italy into extra time and probable victory for a place in the last eight . australian soccer has come a long way in a very short space of time and the challenge now is to take it to the next level , both domestically and internationally . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in australia 's little italy , loyalties clash ahead of match norton street , in the heart of sydney 's little italy , has undergone an unprecedented green-and-gold transformation before the socceroos ' knockout clash with italy in the world cup second-round .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .
" i do n't know .
i am focused on the world cup and can not make long-term plans at my age , " kahn said . asked on a possible career as a coach kahn replied : " i am not thinking of going into coaching .
it is not easy as a goalkeeper .
there are not many goalkeepers who have made successful coaches .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .

" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 28.06.2006 last eight line-up exposes 2002 world cup as a false dawn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't supposed to be this way : the us were among those teams seemingly on the up the 2002 world cup was hailed as a move away from the traditional power bases of international soccer and a new dawn for asian and african teams .
the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .
italy and spain complained long and hard that refereeing decisions went against them in asia . asian soccer , especially , has suffered a setback in germany . asian soccer stalls in germany japan reached the last 16 in 2002 under the disciplinarian coach philippe troussier , but its players have failed to make major inroads into the major european clubs . after crashing out in the first round in germany , japan 's current coach zico , a star of brazil in the 1980s , said more japanese players needed to play abroad if the national team were to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico 's countrymen humiliated his japan team " we can not be successful in the world cup with our abilities limited to the level of asia , " zico said . but with europe and south america dominating club soccer , perhaps it is no surprise that national sides from those countries have re-asserted their dominance . not everyone was fooled in 2002 . the veteran american goalkeeper brad friedel , a seasoned english premiership player , was asked after his side 's elimination to eventual finalists germany in the quarter-finals if he believed the united states had finally arrived as a soccer power . he paused and smiled .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters . " tougher competition the european commission is eager to see tougher competition in europe 's telecom market , which brussels considers essential if europe is to remain on top of key developments in information and communications technology .
reding is to begin sounding out industry officials on wednesday about how to improve regulation with the aim of proposing new rules by the end of the year . reding is already leading a campaign to force mobile telecom operators to lower their so-called " roaming tariffs " on phone calls made from a mobile phone while abroad . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said last week that she was considering launching a sector-wide inquiry into telecommunications . the us model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's telecommunications market is dominated by deutsche telekom reding said that the liberalization of telecom goods and services had had a " dramatic " impact on the market , but that still more needed to be done .
noting that the landmark decision of us authorities to break up at & t in 1984 yielded wide-ranging benefits , she said bold measures were needed to weaken the grip of former state monopolies . in particular , reding raised the possibility that regulators could force dominant operators to let rivals use their infrastructure , which she called " structural separation . " " i believe that the policy option of structural separation could answer many competition problems that europe 's telecom markets are still facing today , " she said . " perhaps we have to be as radical as regulators were in the us in the 1980s to make real progress .
of course , we will have to find our own european solutions , adapted to the needs of our continent , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

they should shake things up more and not just observe .
otherwise , they 'll be attacked .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters . " tougher competition the european commission is eager to see tougher competition in europe 's telecom market , which brussels considers essential if europe is to remain on top of key developments in information and communications technology .
reding is to begin sounding out industry officials on wednesday about how to improve regulation with the aim of proposing new rules by the end of the year . reding is already leading a campaign to force mobile telecom operators to lower their so-called " roaming tariffs " on phone calls made from a mobile phone while abroad . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said last week that she was considering launching a sector-wide inquiry into telecommunications . the us model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's telecommunications market is dominated by deutsche telekom reding said that the liberalization of telecom goods and services had had a " dramatic " impact on the market , but that still more needed to be done .
noting that the landmark decision of us authorities to break up at & t in 1984 yielded wide-ranging benefits , she said bold measures were needed to weaken the grip of former state monopolies . in particular , reding raised the possibility that regulators could force dominant operators to let rivals use their infrastructure , which she called " structural separation . " " i believe that the policy option of structural separation could answer many competition problems that europe 's telecom markets are still facing today , " she said . " perhaps we have to be as radical as regulators were in the us in the 1980s to make real progress .
of course , we will have to find our own european solutions , adapted to the needs of our continent , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

others are less enamored . nick from arizona in the us thinks that germany has been a lot like he had imagined it would be . " people like their beer , as they usually have one with every meal .
i do n't blame them , as it is good and really cheap , " he writes .
" people all live in apartments or flats " and " public transportation is excellent , " his blog says . the author of " my left boot " from australia is also positively surprised at the easygoing atmosphere in the world cup host country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa 's official poster for its friendliness campaign " even germany 's motto for the world cup , " a time to make friends " is being heeded everywhere i go .
far from begrudging the crush of fans and tourists swamping train stations , airports , subways and shops , everyone is open , welcoming and friendly - a complete contrast to the stereotype of the german people and its culture , " " my left boot " writes in his blog entitled " pilgrimage to germany . " " germany is a wonderful , modern nation which is putting on an amazing well organized tournament and showing off everything that is fantastic about this country . " unifying power , discreet police presence for corrigan , an american living in heidelberg , the world cup has had a positive impact on the germans . " what has been really neat to me about the world cup this year is the unifying power it has with the germans . there are german flags everywhere in our town and in heidelberg .
people are really excited , " he writes in his blog , adding that watching germans celebrate has been an eye-opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans celebrate after their team 's success " my real point is that i have learned a lot by watching germany celebrate . we americans are so isolated by our attitudes of independence , consumerism , and autonomy . we are more likely to fear our neighbor than have dinner with them , and that is really sad , " corrigan writes . " manic hispanic " from chicago is pleasantly surprised by the southern german city of munich . " i was expecting much less from the capital of bavaria but this city really wowed me , " manic hispanic says in his blog .
" the fan fest which was held in the old olympic park was great as well .
germany really deserves to be applauded for how well they organized the world cup , especially in munich and nuremberg .
the trains were clean and efficient , the fan fests were great and even when fans were dancing on tables , climbing light posts and going completely nuts to celebrate their team , the police never once stepped in to ' calm things down ' and simply let everyone enjoy themselves . " manic hispanic is equally swept away by berlin , which he calls " dirty gritty , unapologetically urban , and real .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team .

" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .
" i do n't know .
i am focused on the world cup and can not make long-term plans at my age , " kahn said . asked on a possible career as a coach kahn replied : " i am not thinking of going into coaching .
it is not easy as a goalkeeper .
there are not many goalkeepers who have made successful coaches .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .
" i do n't know .
i am focused on the world cup and can not make long-term plans at my age , " kahn said . asked on a possible career as a coach kahn replied : " i am not thinking of going into coaching .
it is not easy as a goalkeeper .
there are not many goalkeepers who have made successful coaches .

others are less enamored . nick from arizona in the us thinks that germany has been a lot like he had imagined it would be . " people like their beer , as they usually have one with every meal .
i do n't blame them , as it is good and really cheap , " he writes .
" people all live in apartments or flats " and " public transportation is excellent , " his blog says . the author of " my left boot " from australia is also positively surprised at the easygoing atmosphere in the world cup host country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa 's official poster for its friendliness campaign " even germany 's motto for the world cup , " a time to make friends " is being heeded everywhere i go .
far from begrudging the crush of fans and tourists swamping train stations , airports , subways and shops , everyone is open , welcoming and friendly - a complete contrast to the stereotype of the german people and its culture , " " my left boot " writes in his blog entitled " pilgrimage to germany . " " germany is a wonderful , modern nation which is putting on an amazing well organized tournament and showing off everything that is fantastic about this country . " unifying power , discreet police presence for corrigan , an american living in heidelberg , the world cup has had a positive impact on the germans . " what has been really neat to me about the world cup this year is the unifying power it has with the germans . there are german flags everywhere in our town and in heidelberg .
people are really excited , " he writes in his blog , adding that watching germans celebrate has been an eye-opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans celebrate after their team 's success " my real point is that i have learned a lot by watching germany celebrate . we americans are so isolated by our attitudes of independence , consumerism , and autonomy . we are more likely to fear our neighbor than have dinner with them , and that is really sad , " corrigan writes . " manic hispanic " from chicago is pleasantly surprised by the southern german city of munich . " i was expecting much less from the capital of bavaria but this city really wowed me , " manic hispanic says in his blog .
" the fan fest which was held in the old olympic park was great as well .
germany really deserves to be applauded for how well they organized the world cup , especially in munich and nuremberg .
the trains were clean and efficient , the fan fests were great and even when fans were dancing on tables , climbing light posts and going completely nuts to celebrate their team , the police never once stepped in to ' calm things down ' and simply let everyone enjoy themselves . " manic hispanic is equally swept away by berlin , which he calls " dirty gritty , unapologetically urban , and real . " claudia schiffer and has-been soccer stars but not everyone is as taken with germany .
amir and raju from england were stunned at their shoddy surroundings when they traveled to leipzig , in former communist eastern germany . " our journey on a tram to our hostel gave amir and me very poor first impressions .
we saw derelict worn down buildings , broken windows , some boarded up , some not .
the paintwork was falling off , but most of it was covered in copious amounts of graffiti .
some kid even tried throwing something on the tram we were on , " the two write in their blog titled " amir and raju do the world cup . "
the two also bemoaned the state of the hostel in leipzig and the lack of entertainment in the neighborhood . " although located next a set of newly built flats in an estate , the hostel is an old 60s / 70s style block of flats .
no bar or any other social spot , no shop , just a couple of overpriced vending machines , " they wrote . " jd " from wellington in new zealand was crushed by the drab world cup opening ceremony in munich .
" i was particularly disappointed with germany ’ s rather poor effort in staging some sort of opening event .
i have been to graduations with more culture , drama , music , pomp and ceremony than what was pathetically displayed by the germans , " jd wrote in his blog " nova zeal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele and claudia schiffer at the world cup opening ceremony " the notion of the ceremony is to welcome the world , highlight the host nation ’ s culture and display what the host nation has to offer .
it is an opportunity to sell your country to the world – what did germany sell ? ?
they sold lederhosen , claudia schiffer , and past football heroes , " jd said . " what is worse is the ceremony looked incredibly disorganized and messy .

but this time the game is so much better placed to take its rightful place among the mainstream of australian sports . soccer , so long largely the domain of australia 's sizeable immigrant communities , has seized the national consciousness with thousands staying up into the early hours of the morning , following the socceroos on television , either at home , in pubs or at large outdoor venues . the australians ' unforgettable come-from-behind win over asian champions japan , outplaying world champions brazil for long periods in a 2-0 loss and their late equalizer with croatia to advance to the second round captivated the home audience . it may have ended bitterly with defender lucas neill , for many australia 's player of the tournament , judged to have brought down fabio grosso for italy 's gut-wrenching penalty , but the die has been cast back home . australia 's domestic league inundated with registrations bildunterschrift : australia 's a-league clubs are reporting keen demand for membership tickets for the new domestic season , which kicks off on august 26 with several of the old guard socceroos expected to return home from europe and play out their careers . the saturation media coverage pushed all of the other codes - such as australian rules , rugby union and rugby league - off the front and back pages while broadcaster sbs television enjoyed massive ratings for its early morning match telecasts . one pressing problem for football federation australia is who will replace the irreplaceable guus hiddink as national coach . dutch master hiddink leaves legacy but also a gaping hole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guus hiddink leaves a confident team on the brink recruited at considerable expense 11 months ago , the master dutch coach transformed the australian national team into a confident passing team which more than matched much higher-ranked opponents at the world cup . hiddink , who now becomes russia 's head coach , instilled a sense of belief into the australian players , along with a much-needed tactical and technical organization and a team bond that was obviously apparent in their matches in germany . australian officials , greatly impressed by hiddink 's influence , want another high-profile international coach to take the socceroos further . australia can expect to improve considerably on its 42nd rating when fifa issue its next rankings after the world cup . socceroos focus on next step into the big league australia 's next international incursion will be qualifying for the 2007 asian cup finals and beyond that the 2008 beijing olympics before attempting to gate-crash another world cup party in south africa in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craig moore and others will make way for a new generation by that stage many of australia 's long-established stars , among them skipper mark viduka , craig moore , mark schwarzer and john aloisi , will have left the national team , but the challenge will be to unearth new young talent and nurture them towards the next world cup . an extraordinary world cup statistic is that australia only led in a match for three minutes in their six hours ' of playing time in germany . yet despite all of that , the socceroos were a few seconds away from taking flagging 10-man italy into extra time and probable victory for a place in the last eight . australian soccer has come a long way in a very short space of time and the challenge now is to take it to the next level , both domestically and internationally . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in australia 's little italy , loyalties clash ahead of match norton street , in the heart of sydney 's little italy , has undergone an unprecedented green-and-gold transformation before the socceroos ' knockout clash with italy in the world cup second-round .

other countries in the region have similar outlooks .

in order to connect with international networks , even with greece and montenegro , a new 400 kilowatt connection between elbasan and podgorica would have to be built . countries such as serbia and croatia have had a connection with international networks since the beginning of the 1990s . both sides will profit many expected that energy prices in the region will increase after these countries enter into the agreement .
but rübig says that such liberalization does n't automatically mean higher prices . " according to the concept that is currently on the table , there will be a new energy mix .
that means that there will also be competition .
and we have in the eu established that overall , where liberalization functions well , prices go down . " energy in the region is essentially produced by hydropower , coal , and natural gas .
there is no nuclear power . " the best and most efficient form of providing energy is hydropower and storage power stations , " said rübig .
" there is a chance here for investors to create sources of efficient energy production . " he adds that is a prudent choice to decide to cooperate with these countries and for both them and the eu , it is a win-win situation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia sign visa accord but energy stand-off still looms the european union and russia signed accords thursday that would make short-stay visas for travel between most of the european union and russia easier to obtain , as well as simplifying rules on multiple-entry documents .

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror . "
" if you have no viable state next to israel , then israel 's ability to be a stable durable state is in danger , " he said .
interfaith dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer was invited to participate at the wjc meeting in berlin the meeting was also attended by non-members of the wjc who have worked to further jewish causes and promote a dialogue between jews and muslims , such as former german foreign minister joschka fischer and retired french politician , holocaust survivor and former president of the european parliament , simone weil . patrick desbois , the secretary general of france 's catholic bishops committee for relations with jews , said the meeting marked the first time that the jewish community had called on public figures from all beliefs to help it formulate policies .

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .
italy and spain complained long and hard that refereeing decisions went against them in asia . asian soccer , especially , has suffered a setback in germany . asian soccer stalls in germany japan reached the last 16 in 2002 under the disciplinarian coach philippe troussier , but its players have failed to make major inroads into the major european clubs . after crashing out in the first round in germany , japan 's current coach zico , a star of brazil in the 1980s , said more japanese players needed to play abroad if the national team were to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico 's countrymen humiliated his japan team " we can not be successful in the world cup with our abilities limited to the level of asia , " zico said . but with europe and south america dominating club soccer , perhaps it is no surprise that national sides from those countries have re-asserted their dominance . not everyone was fooled in 2002 . the veteran american goalkeeper brad friedel , a seasoned english premiership player , was asked after his side 's elimination to eventual finalists germany in the quarter-finals if he believed the united states had finally arrived as a soccer power . he paused and smiled .

reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters .

noting that the landmark decision of us authorities to break up at & t in 1984 yielded wide-ranging benefits , she said bold measures were needed to weaken the grip of former state monopolies . in particular , reding raised the possibility that regulators could force dominant operators to let rivals use their infrastructure , which she called " structural separation . " " i believe that the policy option of structural separation could answer many competition problems that europe 's telecom markets are still facing today , " she said . " perhaps we have to be as radical as regulators were in the us in the 1980s to make real progress .

in the last few months , taliban forces have carried out increasing numbers of suicide attacks and the overall security situation in afghanistan has become decidedly worse over the that period of time . the bundeswehr took over the regional command of the nato isaf peacekeeping force in northern afghanistan on june 1 and currently there are just under 2,800 germany soldiers on the force .
thus far , 18 have been killed on the isaf mission . broader mandate after the attack , the afghan minister of economics , armin farhang , called on a broader mandate for the bundeswehr in afghanistan . " the taliban are also becoming active in the north , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung daily .
" the western protection forces should intervene where it 's needed .
they should shake things up more and not just observe .
otherwise , they 'll be attacked . " according to him , the taliban has reorganized itself and developed new strategies to fight western forces in the country . although northern afghanistan has been seen until now as relatively peaceful , in southern afghanistan , the security situation has been much more serious .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters . " tougher competition the european commission is eager to see tougher competition in europe 's telecom market , which brussels considers essential if europe is to remain on top of key developments in information and communications technology .
reding is to begin sounding out industry officials on wednesday about how to improve regulation with the aim of proposing new rules by the end of the year . reding is already leading a campaign to force mobile telecom operators to lower their so-called " roaming tariffs " on phone calls made from a mobile phone while abroad . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said last week that she was considering launching a sector-wide inquiry into telecommunications . the us model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's telecommunications market is dominated by deutsche telekom reding said that the liberalization of telecom goods and services had had a " dramatic " impact on the market , but that still more needed to be done .
noting that the landmark decision of us authorities to break up at & t in 1984 yielded wide-ranging benefits , she said bold measures were needed to weaken the grip of former state monopolies . in particular , reding raised the possibility that regulators could force dominant operators to let rivals use their infrastructure , which she called " structural separation . " " i believe that the policy option of structural separation could answer many competition problems that europe 's telecom markets are still facing today , " she said . " perhaps we have to be as radical as regulators were in the us in the 1980s to make real progress .
of course , we will have to find our own european solutions , adapted to the needs of our continent , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .
the german tech giant , however , is believed to have gotten the better end of the deal .
-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- eu urges german regulator to step up telecoms competition the european commission has told germany that it must do more to shield consumers from high prices and bolster competition in the country 's fixed-line telecoms market , in which deutsche telekom has a 94 percent share .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.06.2006 southeastern europe seeks energy cooperation with eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy cooperation is a win-win , officials say nine southeastern european countries want to enter into a common energy market with the eu for reliable , affordable and clean energy . albania and its neighbors say they want to have a common energy market by 2008 and are just waiting for eu approval . " for these is countries , it is a bit like a mini-eu , " said ferran taradellas espuny , spokesman for the directorate-general for energy and transportation , who said an agreement is expected to be ratified by the end of june and participating countries would like to begin converting a month later . " still , participants do n't want to open their markets abruptly but gradually .
and together , they expect a liberal and privatized market will improve their energy sectors in the long run . " improving energy efficiency but southeastern european countries do n't want to only put their trust in concepts such as liberalization and privatization .
as a result , the pact prescribes exactly in detail what must be done , said paul rübig , a member of the european parliament who works on energy issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices should decrease with successful liberalization , says paul rübig " in the treaty , it states essentially that the energy efficiency is to be improved , " he said .
" that essentially means that buildings must insulate light fixtures and improve other infrastructure .
and more renewable energy needs to be used . " a new general secretariat will monitor whether the participating countries are following the rules of the accord .
it is going to cost about 20 billion euros in order to fulfil the terms of the agreement .
the world bank has already pledged a billion .
and most of the rest will be found , said rübig . " the budget of the european union will amount to about 900 billion euros by 2013 , " he said .
" and energy is an important part of it . " starting pains liberalizing energy markets has already been decided on and yet still many southeastern european countries are still reluctant . in december 2005 , the government of macedonia promised to liberalize their energy market .
at the same time , they did n't want to give up control over their energy sector , which is a state monopoly .
other countries in the region have similar outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania will have a hard time joining in because of antiquated infrastructure albania is in the most difficult situation because its energy sector has been isolated since communist times .
in order to connect with international networks , even with greece and montenegro , a new 400 kilowatt connection between elbasan and podgorica would have to be built . countries such as serbia and croatia have had a connection with international networks since the beginning of the 1990s . both sides will profit many expected that energy prices in the region will increase after these countries enter into the agreement .
but rübig says that such liberalization does n't automatically mean higher prices . " according to the concept that is currently on the table , there will be a new energy mix .
that means that there will also be competition .
and we have in the eu established that overall , where liberalization functions well , prices go down . " energy in the region is essentially produced by hydropower , coal , and natural gas .
there is no nuclear power . " the best and most efficient form of providing energy is hydropower and storage power stations , " said rübig .
" there is a chance here for investors to create sources of efficient energy production . " he adds that is a prudent choice to decide to cooperate with these countries and for both them and the eu , it is a win-win situation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia sign visa accord but energy stand-off still looms the european union and russia signed accords thursday that would make short-stay visas for travel between most of the european union and russia easier to obtain , as well as simplifying rules on multiple-entry documents .
-lrb- may 25 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

others are less enamored . nick from arizona in the us thinks that germany has been a lot like he had imagined it would be . " people like their beer , as they usually have one with every meal .
i do n't blame them , as it is good and really cheap , " he writes .
" people all live in apartments or flats " and " public transportation is excellent , " his blog says . the author of " my left boot " from australia is also positively surprised at the easygoing atmosphere in the world cup host country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa 's official poster for its friendliness campaign " even germany 's motto for the world cup , " a time to make friends " is being heeded everywhere i go .
far from begrudging the crush of fans and tourists swamping train stations , airports , subways and shops , everyone is open , welcoming and friendly - a complete contrast to the stereotype of the german people and its culture , " " my left boot " writes in his blog entitled " pilgrimage to germany . " " germany is a wonderful , modern nation which is putting on an amazing well organized tournament and showing off everything that is fantastic about this country . " unifying power , discreet police presence for corrigan , an american living in heidelberg , the world cup has had a positive impact on the germans . " what has been really neat to me about the world cup this year is the unifying power it has with the germans . there are german flags everywhere in our town and in heidelberg .
people are really excited , " he writes in his blog , adding that watching germans celebrate has been an eye-opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans celebrate after their team 's success " my real point is that i have learned a lot by watching germany celebrate . we americans are so isolated by our attitudes of independence , consumerism , and autonomy . we are more likely to fear our neighbor than have dinner with them , and that is really sad , " corrigan writes . " manic hispanic " from chicago is pleasantly surprised by the southern german city of munich . " i was expecting much less from the capital of bavaria but this city really wowed me , " manic hispanic says in his blog .
" the fan fest which was held in the old olympic park was great as well .
germany really deserves to be applauded for how well they organized the world cup , especially in munich and nuremberg .
the trains were clean and efficient , the fan fests were great and even when fans were dancing on tables , climbing light posts and going completely nuts to celebrate their team , the police never once stepped in to ' calm things down ' and simply let everyone enjoy themselves . " manic hispanic is equally swept away by berlin , which he calls " dirty gritty , unapologetically urban , and real . " claudia schiffer and has-been soccer stars but not everyone is as taken with germany .
amir and raju from england were stunned at their shoddy surroundings when they traveled to leipzig , in former communist eastern germany . " our journey on a tram to our hostel gave amir and me very poor first impressions .
we saw derelict worn down buildings , broken windows , some boarded up , some not .
the paintwork was falling off , but most of it was covered in copious amounts of graffiti .
some kid even tried throwing something on the tram we were on , " the two write in their blog titled " amir and raju do the world cup . "
the two also bemoaned the state of the hostel in leipzig and the lack of entertainment in the neighborhood . " although located next a set of newly built flats in an estate , the hostel is an old 60s / 70s style block of flats .
no bar or any other social spot , no shop , just a couple of overpriced vending machines , " they wrote . " jd " from wellington in new zealand was crushed by the drab world cup opening ceremony in munich .
" i was particularly disappointed with germany ’ s rather poor effort in staging some sort of opening event .
i have been to graduations with more culture , drama , music , pomp and ceremony than what was pathetically displayed by the germans , " jd wrote in his blog " nova zeal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele and claudia schiffer at the world cup opening ceremony " the notion of the ceremony is to welcome the world , highlight the host nation ’ s culture and display what the host nation has to offer .
it is an opportunity to sell your country to the world – what did germany sell ? ?
they sold lederhosen , claudia schiffer , and past football heroes , " jd said . " what is worse is the ceremony looked incredibly disorganized and messy .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .
" i do n't know .
i am focused on the world cup and can not make long-term plans at my age , " kahn said . asked on a possible career as a coach kahn replied : " i am not thinking of going into coaching .
it is not easy as a goalkeeper .
there are not many goalkeepers who have made successful coaches .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters . " tougher competition the european commission is eager to see tougher competition in europe 's telecom market , which brussels considers essential if europe is to remain on top of key developments in information and communications technology .
reding is to begin sounding out industry officials on wednesday about how to improve regulation with the aim of proposing new rules by the end of the year . reding is already leading a campaign to force mobile telecom operators to lower their so-called " roaming tariffs " on phone calls made from a mobile phone while abroad . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said last week that she was considering launching a sector-wide inquiry into telecommunications . the us model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's telecommunications market is dominated by deutsche telekom reding said that the liberalization of telecom goods and services had had a " dramatic " impact on the market , but that still more needed to be done .
noting that the landmark decision of us authorities to break up at & t in 1984 yielded wide-ranging benefits , she said bold measures were needed to weaken the grip of former state monopolies . in particular , reding raised the possibility that regulators could force dominant operators to let rivals use their infrastructure , which she called " structural separation . " " i believe that the policy option of structural separation could answer many competition problems that europe 's telecom markets are still facing today , " she said . " perhaps we have to be as radical as regulators were in the us in the 1980s to make real progress .
of course , we will have to find our own european solutions , adapted to the needs of our continent , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

others are less enamored . nick from arizona in the us thinks that germany has been a lot like he had imagined it would be . " people like their beer , as they usually have one with every meal .
i do n't blame them , as it is good and really cheap , " he writes .

far from begrudging the crush of fans and tourists swamping train stations , airports , subways and shops , everyone is open , welcoming and friendly - a complete contrast to the stereotype of the german people and its culture , " " my left boot " writes in his blog entitled " pilgrimage to germany . " " germany is a wonderful , modern nation which is putting on an amazing well organized tournament and showing off everything that is fantastic about this country . " unifying power , discreet police presence for corrigan , an american living in heidelberg , the world cup has had a positive impact on the germans . " what has been really neat to me about the world cup this year is the unifying power it has with the germans . there are german flags everywhere in our town and in heidelberg .
people are really excited , " he writes in his blog , adding that watching germans celebrate has been an eye-opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans celebrate after their team 's success " my real point is that i have learned a lot by watching germany celebrate . we americans are so isolated by our attitudes of independence , consumerism , and autonomy . we are more likely to fear our neighbor than have dinner with them , and that is really sad , " corrigan writes . " manic hispanic " from chicago is pleasantly surprised by the southern german city of munich . " i was expecting much less from the capital of bavaria but this city really wowed me , " manic hispanic says in his blog .
" the fan fest which was held in the old olympic park was great as well .
germany really deserves to be applauded for how well they organized the world cup , especially in munich and nuremberg .
the trains were clean and efficient , the fan fests were great and even when fans were dancing on tables , climbing light posts and going completely nuts to celebrate their team , the police never once stepped in to ' calm things down ' and simply let everyone enjoy themselves . " manic hispanic is equally swept away by berlin , which he calls " dirty gritty , unapologetically urban , and real . " claudia schiffer and has-been soccer stars but not everyone is as taken with germany .
amir and raju from england were stunned at their shoddy surroundings when they traveled to leipzig , in former communist eastern germany . " our journey on a tram to our hostel gave amir and me very poor first impressions .
we saw derelict worn down buildings , broken windows , some boarded up , some not .
the paintwork was falling off , but most of it was covered in copious amounts of graffiti .
some kid even tried throwing something on the tram we were on , " the two write in their blog titled " amir and raju do the world cup . "
the two also bemoaned the state of the hostel in leipzig and the lack of entertainment in the neighborhood . " although located next a set of newly built flats in an estate , the hostel is an old 60s / 70s style block of flats .
no bar or any other social spot , no shop , just a couple of overpriced vending machines , " they wrote . " jd " from wellington in new zealand was crushed by the drab world cup opening ceremony in munich .
" i was particularly disappointed with germany ’ s rather poor effort in staging some sort of opening event .
i have been to graduations with more culture , drama , music , pomp and ceremony than what was pathetically displayed by the germans , " jd wrote in his blog " nova zeal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele and claudia schiffer at the world cup opening ceremony " the notion of the ceremony is to welcome the world , highlight the host nation ’ s culture and display what the host nation has to offer .
it is an opportunity to sell your country to the world – what did germany sell ? ?
they sold lederhosen , claudia schiffer , and past football heroes , " jd said . " what is worse is the ceremony looked incredibly disorganized and messy .

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror .

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .
italy and spain complained long and hard that refereeing decisions went against them in asia . asian soccer , especially , has suffered a setback in germany . asian soccer stalls in germany japan reached the last 16 in 2002 under the disciplinarian coach philippe troussier , but its players have failed to make major inroads into the major european clubs . after crashing out in the first round in germany , japan 's current coach zico , a star of brazil in the 1980s , said more japanese players needed to play abroad if the national team were to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico 's countrymen humiliated his japan team " we can not be successful in the world cup with our abilities limited to the level of asia , " zico said . but with europe and south america dominating club soccer , perhaps it is no surprise that national sides from those countries have re-asserted their dominance . not everyone was fooled in 2002 . the veteran american goalkeeper brad friedel , a seasoned english premiership player , was asked after his side 's elimination to eventual finalists germany in the quarter-finals if he believed the united states had finally arrived as a soccer power . he paused and smiled .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties .

but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters .

but this time the game is so much better placed to take its rightful place among the mainstream of australian sports . soccer , so long largely the domain of australia 's sizeable immigrant communities , has seized the national consciousness with thousands staying up into the early hours of the morning , following the socceroos on television , either at home , in pubs or at large outdoor venues . the australians ' unforgettable come-from-behind win over asian champions japan , outplaying world champions brazil for long periods in a 2-0 loss and their late equalizer with croatia to advance to the second round captivated the home audience . it may have ended bitterly with defender lucas neill , for many australia 's player of the tournament , judged to have brought down fabio grosso for italy 's gut-wrenching penalty , but the die has been cast back home . australia 's domestic league inundated with registrations bildunterschrift : australia 's a-league clubs are reporting keen demand for membership tickets for the new domestic season , which kicks off on august 26 with several of the old guard socceroos expected to return home from europe and play out their careers . the saturation media coverage pushed all of the other codes - such as australian rules , rugby union and rugby league - off the front and back pages while broadcaster sbs television enjoyed massive ratings for its early morning match telecasts . one pressing problem for football federation australia is who will replace the irreplaceable guus hiddink as national coach . dutch master hiddink leaves legacy but also a gaping hole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guus hiddink leaves a confident team on the brink recruited at considerable expense 11 months ago , the master dutch coach transformed the australian national team into a confident passing team which more than matched much higher-ranked opponents at the world cup . hiddink , who now becomes russia 's head coach , instilled a sense of belief into the australian players , along with a much-needed tactical and technical organization and a team bond that was obviously apparent in their matches in germany . australian officials , greatly impressed by hiddink 's influence , want another high-profile international coach to take the socceroos further . australia can expect to improve considerably on its 42nd rating when fifa issue its next rankings after the world cup . socceroos focus on next step into the big league australia 's next international incursion will be qualifying for the 2007 asian cup finals and beyond that the 2008 beijing olympics before attempting to gate-crash another world cup party in south africa in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craig moore and others will make way for a new generation by that stage many of australia 's long-established stars , among them skipper mark viduka , craig moore , mark schwarzer and john aloisi , will have left the national team , but the challenge will be to unearth new young talent and nurture them towards the next world cup . an extraordinary world cup statistic is that australia only led in a match for three minutes in their six hours ' of playing time in germany . yet despite all of that , the socceroos were a few seconds away from taking flagging 10-man italy into extra time and probable victory for a place in the last eight . australian soccer has come a long way in a very short space of time and the challenge now is to take it to the next level , both domestically and internationally . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in australia 's little italy , loyalties clash ahead of match norton street , in the heart of sydney 's little italy , has undergone an unprecedented green-and-gold transformation before the socceroos ' knockout clash with italy in the world cup second-round .

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .
italy and spain complained long and hard that refereeing decisions went against them in asia . asian soccer , especially , has suffered a setback in germany . asian soccer stalls in germany japan reached the last 16 in 2002 under the disciplinarian coach philippe troussier , but its players have failed to make major inroads into the major european clubs . after crashing out in the first round in germany , japan 's current coach zico , a star of brazil in the 1980s , said more japanese players needed to play abroad if the national team were to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico 's countrymen humiliated his japan team " we can not be successful in the world cup with our abilities limited to the level of asia , " zico said . but with europe and south america dominating club soccer , perhaps it is no surprise that national sides from those countries have re-asserted their dominance . not everyone was fooled in 2002 . the veteran american goalkeeper brad friedel , a seasoned english premiership player , was asked after his side 's elimination to eventual finalists germany in the quarter-finals if he believed the united states had finally arrived as a soccer power . he paused and smiled .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters . " tougher competition the european commission is eager to see tougher competition in europe 's telecom market , which brussels considers essential if europe is to remain on top of key developments in information and communications technology .
reding is to begin sounding out industry officials on wednesday about how to improve regulation with the aim of proposing new rules by the end of the year . reding is already leading a campaign to force mobile telecom operators to lower their so-called " roaming tariffs " on phone calls made from a mobile phone while abroad . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said last week that she was considering launching a sector-wide inquiry into telecommunications . the us model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's telecommunications market is dominated by deutsche telekom reding said that the liberalization of telecom goods and services had had a " dramatic " impact on the market , but that still more needed to be done .
noting that the landmark decision of us authorities to break up at & t in 1984 yielded wide-ranging benefits , she said bold measures were needed to weaken the grip of former state monopolies . in particular , reding raised the possibility that regulators could force dominant operators to let rivals use their infrastructure , which she called " structural separation . " " i believe that the policy option of structural separation could answer many competition problems that europe 's telecom markets are still facing today , " she said . " perhaps we have to be as radical as regulators were in the us in the 1980s to make real progress .
of course , we will have to find our own european solutions , adapted to the needs of our continent , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- eu urges german regulator to step up telecoms competition the european commission has told germany that it must do more to shield consumers from high prices and bolster competition in the country 's fixed-line telecoms market , in which deutsche telekom has a 94 percent share .

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror . "
" if you have no viable state next to israel , then israel 's ability to be a stable durable state is in danger , " he said .
interfaith dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer was invited to participate at the wjc meeting in berlin the meeting was also attended by non-members of the wjc who have worked to further jewish causes and promote a dialogue between jews and muslims , such as former german foreign minister joschka fischer and retired french politician , holocaust survivor and former president of the european parliament , simone weil . patrick desbois , the secretary general of france 's catholic bishops committee for relations with jews , said the meeting marked the first time that the jewish community had called on public figures from all beliefs to help it formulate policies .

" in the classic media sector this kind of concentration would be unthinkable , " he said tuesday , after a two-day conference in berlin .
" it is important not to let this power develop unobserved . " google have a responsibility similar to other publishers not to allow access to illegal sites , such as those with neo-nazi content , which is illegal in germany , machill said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is on nearly 70 percent of germans ' screens when they want information making the search results transparent search engine operators ' german subsidiaries agreed to voluntarily filter sites with x-rated content or that glorify violence out of their results lists last year .
government needs to stay aware how the search companies operate and regulate them if needed , machill added . the voluntary obligation to filter sites amounts to nothing more than a " weak regulation without any sanctions , " according to norbert schneider , director of the north rhine westphalia state media institute .
he added it is up to government to make the power of search engines clear to internet users . machill also suggested starting a publicly funded european counterweight to the three us search engines that would level the search engine playing field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislation can influence what appears in search results google : we follow local laws there is no reason for added regulation or to fear explicit manipulation of search results because they are determined by a mathematical formula , according to google spokesperson stefan keuchel , adding that the only results that can be bought are labelled as advertisements . google and yahoo representatives , who for reasons of competition refuse to publish the formula that determines their search results , said they adhere to local laws when determining what results appear . " we believe in freedom of expression , not censorship , " keuchel said . both companies have , however , come under heavy fire from free speech organizations for censoring search results in china , where sites dealing with the tiananmen square massacre , tibet and independent news are censored under chinese laws . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders digitalization of cultural heritage how should european cultural heritage be preserved in the age of the internet ?

" for these is countries , it is a bit like a mini-eu , " said ferran taradellas espuny , spokesman for the directorate-general for energy and transportation , who said an agreement is expected to be ratified by the end of june and participating countries would like to begin converting a month later . " still , participants do n't want to open their markets abruptly but gradually .
and together , they expect a liberal and privatized market will improve their energy sectors in the long run . " improving energy efficiency but southeastern european countries do n't want to only put their trust in concepts such as liberalization and privatization .
as a result , the pact prescribes exactly in detail what must be done , said paul rübig , a member of the european parliament who works on energy issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices should decrease with successful liberalization , says paul rübig " in the treaty , it states essentially that the energy efficiency is to be improved , " he said .
" that essentially means that buildings must insulate light fixtures and improve other infrastructure .
and more renewable energy needs to be used . " a new general secretariat will monitor whether the participating countries are following the rules of the accord .
it is going to cost about 20 billion euros in order to fulfil the terms of the agreement .
the world bank has already pledged a billion .
and most of the rest will be found , said rübig . " the budget of the european union will amount to about 900 billion euros by 2013 , " he said .
" and energy is an important part of it . " starting pains liberalizing energy markets has already been decided on and yet still many southeastern european countries are still reluctant . in december 2005 , the government of macedonia promised to liberalize their energy market .
at the same time , they did n't want to give up control over their energy sector , which is a state monopoly .
other countries in the region have similar outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania will have a hard time joining in because of antiquated infrastructure albania is in the most difficult situation because its energy sector has been isolated since communist times .
in order to connect with international networks , even with greece and montenegro , a new 400 kilowatt connection between elbasan and podgorica would have to be built . countries such as serbia and croatia have had a connection with international networks since the beginning of the 1990s . both sides will profit many expected that energy prices in the region will increase after these countries enter into the agreement .
but rübig says that such liberalization does n't automatically mean higher prices . " according to the concept that is currently on the table , there will be a new energy mix .
that means that there will also be competition .
and we have in the eu established that overall , where liberalization functions well , prices go down . " energy in the region is essentially produced by hydropower , coal , and natural gas .
there is no nuclear power . " the best and most efficient form of providing energy is hydropower and storage power stations , " said rübig .
" there is a chance here for investors to create sources of efficient energy production .

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .
" i do n't know .
i am focused on the world cup and can not make long-term plans at my age , " kahn said . asked on a possible career as a coach kahn replied : " i am not thinking of going into coaching .
it is not easy as a goalkeeper .
there are not many goalkeepers who have made successful coaches .

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror .

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror . "
" if you have no viable state next to israel , then israel 's ability to be a stable durable state is in danger , " he said .

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .
italy and spain complained long and hard that refereeing decisions went against them in asia . asian soccer , especially , has suffered a setback in germany . asian soccer stalls in germany japan reached the last 16 in 2002 under the disciplinarian coach philippe troussier , but its players have failed to make major inroads into the major european clubs . after crashing out in the first round in germany , japan 's current coach zico , a star of brazil in the 1980s , said more japanese players needed to play abroad if the national team were to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico 's countrymen humiliated his japan team " we can not be successful in the world cup with our abilities limited to the level of asia , " zico said . but with europe and south america dominating club soccer , perhaps it is no surprise that national sides from those countries have re-asserted their dominance . not everyone was fooled in 2002 . the veteran american goalkeeper brad friedel , a seasoned english premiership player , was asked after his side 's elimination to eventual finalists germany in the quarter-finals if he believed the united states had finally arrived as a soccer power . he paused and smiled .

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror . "
" if you have no viable state next to israel , then israel 's ability to be a stable durable state is in danger , " he said .
interfaith dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer was invited to participate at the wjc meeting in berlin the meeting was also attended by non-members of the wjc who have worked to further jewish causes and promote a dialogue between jews and muslims , such as former german foreign minister joschka fischer and retired french politician , holocaust survivor and former president of the european parliament , simone weil . patrick desbois , the secretary general of france 's catholic bishops committee for relations with jews , said the meeting marked the first time that the jewish community had called on public figures from all beliefs to help it formulate policies .

others are less enamored . nick from arizona in the us thinks that germany has been a lot like he had imagined it would be . " people like their beer , as they usually have one with every meal .
i do n't blame them , as it is good and really cheap , " he writes .
" people all live in apartments or flats " and " public transportation is excellent , " his blog says . the author of " my left boot " from australia is also positively surprised at the easygoing atmosphere in the world cup host country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa 's official poster for its friendliness campaign " even germany 's motto for the world cup , " a time to make friends " is being heeded everywhere i go .
far from begrudging the crush of fans and tourists swamping train stations , airports , subways and shops , everyone is open , welcoming and friendly - a complete contrast to the stereotype of the german people and its culture , " " my left boot " writes in his blog entitled " pilgrimage to germany . " " germany is a wonderful , modern nation which is putting on an amazing well organized tournament and showing off everything that is fantastic about this country . " unifying power , discreet police presence for corrigan , an american living in heidelberg , the world cup has had a positive impact on the germans . " what has been really neat to me about the world cup this year is the unifying power it has with the germans . there are german flags everywhere in our town and in heidelberg .
people are really excited , " he writes in his blog , adding that watching germans celebrate has been an eye-opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans celebrate after their team 's success " my real point is that i have learned a lot by watching germany celebrate . we americans are so isolated by our attitudes of independence , consumerism , and autonomy . we are more likely to fear our neighbor than have dinner with them , and that is really sad , " corrigan writes . " manic hispanic " from chicago is pleasantly surprised by the southern german city of munich . " i was expecting much less from the capital of bavaria but this city really wowed me , " manic hispanic says in his blog .
" the fan fest which was held in the old olympic park was great as well .
germany really deserves to be applauded for how well they organized the world cup , especially in munich and nuremberg .
the trains were clean and efficient , the fan fests were great and even when fans were dancing on tables , climbing light posts and going completely nuts to celebrate their team , the police never once stepped in to ' calm things down ' and simply let everyone enjoy themselves . " manic hispanic is equally swept away by berlin , which he calls " dirty gritty , unapologetically urban , and real . " claudia schiffer and has-been soccer stars but not everyone is as taken with germany .
amir and raju from england were stunned at their shoddy surroundings when they traveled to leipzig , in former communist eastern germany . " our journey on a tram to our hostel gave amir and me very poor first impressions .
we saw derelict worn down buildings , broken windows , some boarded up , some not .
the paintwork was falling off , but most of it was covered in copious amounts of graffiti .
some kid even tried throwing something on the tram we were on , " the two write in their blog titled " amir and raju do the world cup . "
the two also bemoaned the state of the hostel in leipzig and the lack of entertainment in the neighborhood . " although located next a set of newly built flats in an estate , the hostel is an old 60s / 70s style block of flats .
no bar or any other social spot , no shop , just a couple of overpriced vending machines , " they wrote . " jd " from wellington in new zealand was crushed by the drab world cup opening ceremony in munich .
" i was particularly disappointed with germany ’ s rather poor effort in staging some sort of opening event .
i have been to graduations with more culture , drama , music , pomp and ceremony than what was pathetically displayed by the germans , " jd wrote in his blog " nova zeal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele and claudia schiffer at the world cup opening ceremony " the notion of the ceremony is to welcome the world , highlight the host nation ’ s culture and display what the host nation has to offer .
it is an opportunity to sell your country to the world – what did germany sell ? ?
they sold lederhosen , claudia schiffer , and past football heroes , " jd said . " what is worse is the ceremony looked incredibly disorganized and messy .

" i am only human and i want to be active .
if a player is happy to be on the substitute 's bench you should send him home from the world cup straight away , " kahn said at wednesday 's press conference . " however i will do everything for this team to win the trophy .
i have always said i wanted to be world champion .
i came close in 2002 .
if i can do that now - even though i am not playing - it will be a major achievement . " kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team . " the further we go in the competition , the more kahn contributes to our success , " said klinsmann . his haul of 85 caps makes kahn the most experienced player in the germany squad and he is passing on knowledge to his younger team-mates .
" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .
" i do n't know .
i am focused on the world cup and can not make long-term plans at my age , " kahn said . asked on a possible career as a coach kahn replied : " i am not thinking of going into coaching .
it is not easy as a goalkeeper .
there are not many goalkeepers who have made successful coaches .

others are less enamored . nick from arizona in the us thinks that germany has been a lot like he had imagined it would be . " people like their beer , as they usually have one with every meal .
i do n't blame them , as it is good and really cheap , " he writes .
" people all live in apartments or flats " and " public transportation is excellent , " his blog says . the author of " my left boot " from australia is also positively surprised at the easygoing atmosphere in the world cup host country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa 's official poster for its friendliness campaign " even germany 's motto for the world cup , " a time to make friends " is being heeded everywhere i go .
far from begrudging the crush of fans and tourists swamping train stations , airports , subways and shops , everyone is open , welcoming and friendly - a complete contrast to the stereotype of the german people and its culture , " " my left boot " writes in his blog entitled " pilgrimage to germany . " " germany is a wonderful , modern nation which is putting on an amazing well organized tournament and showing off everything that is fantastic about this country . " unifying power , discreet police presence for corrigan , an american living in heidelberg , the world cup has had a positive impact on the germans . " what has been really neat to me about the world cup this year is the unifying power it has with the germans . there are german flags everywhere in our town and in heidelberg .
people are really excited , " he writes in his blog , adding that watching germans celebrate has been an eye-opener . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans celebrate after their team 's success " my real point is that i have learned a lot by watching germany celebrate . we americans are so isolated by our attitudes of independence , consumerism , and autonomy . we are more likely to fear our neighbor than have dinner with them , and that is really sad , " corrigan writes . " manic hispanic " from chicago is pleasantly surprised by the southern german city of munich . " i was expecting much less from the capital of bavaria but this city really wowed me , " manic hispanic says in his blog .
" the fan fest which was held in the old olympic park was great as well .
germany really deserves to be applauded for how well they organized the world cup , especially in munich and nuremberg .
the trains were clean and efficient , the fan fests were great and even when fans were dancing on tables , climbing light posts and going completely nuts to celebrate their team , the police never once stepped in to ' calm things down ' and simply let everyone enjoy themselves . " manic hispanic is equally swept away by berlin , which he calls " dirty gritty , unapologetically urban , and real . " claudia schiffer and has-been soccer stars but not everyone is as taken with germany .
amir and raju from england were stunned at their shoddy surroundings when they traveled to leipzig , in former communist eastern germany . " our journey on a tram to our hostel gave amir and me very poor first impressions .
we saw derelict worn down buildings , broken windows , some boarded up , some not .
the paintwork was falling off , but most of it was covered in copious amounts of graffiti .
some kid even tried throwing something on the tram we were on , " the two write in their blog titled " amir and raju do the world cup . "
the two also bemoaned the state of the hostel in leipzig and the lack of entertainment in the neighborhood . " although located next a set of newly built flats in an estate , the hostel is an old 60s / 70s style block of flats .
no bar or any other social spot , no shop , just a couple of overpriced vending machines , " they wrote . " jd " from wellington in new zealand was crushed by the drab world cup opening ceremony in munich .
" i was particularly disappointed with germany ’ s rather poor effort in staging some sort of opening event .
i have been to graduations with more culture , drama , music , pomp and ceremony than what was pathetically displayed by the germans , " jd wrote in his blog " nova zeal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pele and claudia schiffer at the world cup opening ceremony " the notion of the ceremony is to welcome the world , highlight the host nation ’ s culture and display what the host nation has to offer .
it is an opportunity to sell your country to the world – what did germany sell ? ?
they sold lederhosen , claudia schiffer , and past football heroes , " jd said . " what is worse is the ceremony looked incredibly disorganized and messy .

the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently . the world cup in germany has confounded predictions that the power base of soccer has shifted and made the 2002 tournament in asia look like a quirk of history . the quarter-final qualifiers four years ago were : brazil , england , germany , senegal , spain , co-hosts south korea , turkey and the united states . senegal were world cup debutants , south korea had never won a world cup match in their history before co-hosting the tournament , turkey were in unchartered territory and the americans seemed astonished to have got so far . fast forward four years . brazil , england and germany are in the last eight again but the similarities with 2002 end there . this year 's lineup is completed by argentina , france , italy , portugal and ukraine , who between them have won six of the 17 world cups contested . while ukraine are not a recognized power , it is hard to describe the former soviet republic as a surprise quarter-finalist when they have one of the world 's most expensive strikers , the 43.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 54.5 million -rrb- chelsea recruit andriy shevchenko , in their ranks . class of 2002 failed to show up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usa 's world cup hopes went down the pan senegal and turkey failed to even qualify for the 2006 finals and the united states went out with a whimper in the first round . " i think it is a pity that the old powers from south america and europe have dominated , " said fifa president sepp blatter . the question is , why ? there is the undoubted advantage for the european teams of playing in their own time zone in weather conditions they are used to , although the unseasonally high 30-degree heat in germany should have suited teams from the southern hemisphere . rest and luck have aided european teams in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are more relaxed at the 2006 world cup one important factor was a ruling by world governing body fifa that the european club season must end by may 15 , allowing players some rest before embarking on the world cup that started on june 9 . european players complained of being tired in 2002 while the south korean players seemed fresh in comparison . and then there is the dollop of luck that all teams must have .
italy and spain complained long and hard that refereeing decisions went against them in asia . asian soccer , especially , has suffered a setback in germany . asian soccer stalls in germany japan reached the last 16 in 2002 under the disciplinarian coach philippe troussier , but its players have failed to make major inroads into the major european clubs . after crashing out in the first round in germany , japan 's current coach zico , a star of brazil in the 1980s , said more japanese players needed to play abroad if the national team were to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico 's countrymen humiliated his japan team " we can not be successful in the world cup with our abilities limited to the level of asia , " zico said . but with europe and south america dominating club soccer , perhaps it is no surprise that national sides from those countries have re-asserted their dominance . not everyone was fooled in 2002 . the veteran american goalkeeper brad friedel , a seasoned english premiership player , was asked after his side 's elimination to eventual finalists germany in the quarter-finals if he believed the united states had finally arrived as a soccer power . he paused and smiled .

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror . "
" if you have no viable state next to israel , then israel 's ability to be a stable durable state is in danger , " he said .
interfaith dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer was invited to participate at the wjc meeting in berlin the meeting was also attended by non-members of the wjc who have worked to further jewish causes and promote a dialogue between jews and muslims , such as former german foreign minister joschka fischer and retired french politician , holocaust survivor and former president of the european parliament , simone weil . patrick desbois , the secretary general of france 's catholic bishops committee for relations with jews , said the meeting marked the first time that the jewish community had called on public figures from all beliefs to help it formulate policies .

but this time the game is so much better placed to take its rightful place among the mainstream of australian sports . soccer , so long largely the domain of australia 's sizeable immigrant communities , has seized the national consciousness with thousands staying up into the early hours of the morning , following the socceroos on television , either at home , in pubs or at large outdoor venues . the australians ' unforgettable come-from-behind win over asian champions japan , outplaying world champions brazil for long periods in a 2-0 loss and their late equalizer with croatia to advance to the second round captivated the home audience . it may have ended bitterly with defender lucas neill , for many australia 's player of the tournament , judged to have brought down fabio grosso for italy 's gut-wrenching penalty , but the die has been cast back home . australia 's domestic league inundated with registrations bildunterschrift : australia 's a-league clubs are reporting keen demand for membership tickets for the new domestic season , which kicks off on august 26 with several of the old guard socceroos expected to return home from europe and play out their careers . the saturation media coverage pushed all of the other codes - such as australian rules , rugby union and rugby league - off the front and back pages while broadcaster sbs television enjoyed massive ratings for its early morning match telecasts . one pressing problem for football federation australia is who will replace the irreplaceable guus hiddink as national coach . dutch master hiddink leaves legacy but also a gaping hole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guus hiddink leaves a confident team on the brink recruited at considerable expense 11 months ago , the master dutch coach transformed the australian national team into a confident passing team which more than matched much higher-ranked opponents at the world cup . hiddink , who now becomes russia 's head coach , instilled a sense of belief into the australian players , along with a much-needed tactical and technical organization and a team bond that was obviously apparent in their matches in germany . australian officials , greatly impressed by hiddink 's influence , want another high-profile international coach to take the socceroos further . australia can expect to improve considerably on its 42nd rating when fifa issue its next rankings after the world cup . socceroos focus on next step into the big league australia 's next international incursion will be qualifying for the 2007 asian cup finals and beyond that the 2008 beijing olympics before attempting to gate-crash another world cup party in south africa in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craig moore and others will make way for a new generation by that stage many of australia 's long-established stars , among them skipper mark viduka , craig moore , mark schwarzer and john aloisi , will have left the national team , but the challenge will be to unearth new young talent and nurture them towards the next world cup . an extraordinary world cup statistic is that australia only led in a match for three minutes in their six hours ' of playing time in germany . yet despite all of that , the socceroos were a few seconds away from taking flagging 10-man italy into extra time and probable victory for a place in the last eight . australian soccer has come a long way in a very short space of time and the challenge now is to take it to the next level , both domestically and internationally . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in australia 's little italy , loyalties clash ahead of match norton street , in the heart of sydney 's little italy , has undergone an unprecedented green-and-gold transformation before the socceroos ' knockout clash with italy in the world cup second-round .

" kahn was voted best player at the 2002 world cup after inspiring germany to the final , although a blunder in the final helped brazil to a 2-0 win . world cup hero still has a role to play says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's great 2002 world cup ended in final defeat despite stripping kahn of the captaincy on his arrival in august 2004 and making him second choice ; klinsmann has stressed kahn 's importance to the team .

" i am obsessed by winning titles and being the number one so helping the team is giving me a new perspective , " kahn revealed . " i am not finding it difficult spending a few weeks here .
i think it is fair to say i bring my experience to the team .
sometimes the younger players need to be pushed or given an arm around the shoulder .
i can do that . " " of course i want to play .
but jürgen klinsmann chose jens lehmann and i have to accept that . " just three days ago kahn complained that he did not understand why lehmann was favored over him and said klinsmann had still not given him an explanation . kahn respects lehmann 's performances despite feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has kept three clean sheets in a row the two goalkeepers were involved in a bitter war of words in the press making kahn 's demotion harder to swallow but the veteran goalkeeper admitted lehmann had acquitted himself well so far . " jens is having a good tournament .
we have kept three clean sheets in a row and that says something for him , " kahn said . lehmann will be in goal again against argentina on friday and kahn says there is no reason to fear the south americans after last year 's two friendlies ended 2-2 . " we have come close to beating argentina .
we have tended to draw against the top teams but this time we will have extra-time or even penalties , " kahn explained . " everyone knows how good germany are at penalties . " no thoughts of coaching future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe oli 's future lies in motivational speaking kahn 's future after the tournament is uncertain and he refused to say whether he would retire from international football .
" i do n't know .
i am focused on the world cup and can not make long-term plans at my age , " kahn said . asked on a possible career as a coach kahn replied : " i am not thinking of going into coaching .
it is not easy as a goalkeeper .

" the most effective way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom operators across the eu would of course be to create an independent european telecom regulator that would work together with national regulators in a system , similar to the european system of central banks , " reding said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for telecommunications viviane reding one of the countries that would be affected by the establishment of the eu telecom regulator is germany .
reding has previously criticized the german government for tolerating deutsche telekom 's " monopolistic " and " unilateralist " position on the country 's telecommunications market " out of short-term political opportunism . " she also raised the possibility of setting up a european agency to manage radio frequencies , but acknowledged that such an idea was " not yet very popular in some quarters . " tougher competition the european commission is eager to see tougher competition in europe 's telecom market , which brussels considers essential if europe is to remain on top of key developments in information and communications technology .
reding is to begin sounding out industry officials on wednesday about how to improve regulation with the aim of proposing new rules by the end of the year . reding is already leading a campaign to force mobile telecom operators to lower their so-called " roaming tariffs " on phone calls made from a mobile phone while abroad . eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said last week that she was considering launching a sector-wide inquiry into telecommunications . the us model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's telecommunications market is dominated by deutsche telekom reding said that the liberalization of telecom goods and services had had a " dramatic " impact on the market , but that still more needed to be done .
noting that the landmark decision of us authorities to break up at & t in 1984 yielded wide-ranging benefits , she said bold measures were needed to weaken the grip of former state monopolies . in particular , reding raised the possibility that regulators could force dominant operators to let rivals use their infrastructure , which she called " structural separation . " " i believe that the policy option of structural separation could answer many competition problems that europe 's telecom markets are still facing today , " she said . " perhaps we have to be as radical as regulators were in the us in the 1980s to make real progress .
of course , we will have to find our own european solutions , adapted to the needs of our continent , " she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

" for these is countries , it is a bit like a mini-eu , " said ferran taradellas espuny , spokesman for the directorate-general for energy and transportation , who said an agreement is expected to be ratified by the end of june and participating countries would like to begin converting a month later . " still , participants do n't want to open their markets abruptly but gradually .
and together , they expect a liberal and privatized market will improve their energy sectors in the long run . " improving energy efficiency but southeastern european countries do n't want to only put their trust in concepts such as liberalization and privatization .
as a result , the pact prescribes exactly in detail what must be done , said paul rübig , a member of the european parliament who works on energy issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices should decrease with successful liberalization , says paul rübig " in the treaty , it states essentially that the energy efficiency is to be improved , " he said .
" that essentially means that buildings must insulate light fixtures and improve other infrastructure .
and more renewable energy needs to be used . " a new general secretariat will monitor whether the participating countries are following the rules of the accord .
it is going to cost about 20 billion euros in order to fulfil the terms of the agreement .
the world bank has already pledged a billion .
and most of the rest will be found , said rübig . " the budget of the european union will amount to about 900 billion euros by 2013 , " he said .
" and energy is an important part of it . " starting pains liberalizing energy markets has already been decided on and yet still many southeastern european countries are still reluctant . in december 2005 , the government of macedonia promised to liberalize their energy market .
at the same time , they did n't want to give up control over their energy sector , which is a state monopoly .
other countries in the region have similar outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania will have a hard time joining in because of antiquated infrastructure albania is in the most difficult situation because its energy sector has been isolated since communist times .
in order to connect with international networks , even with greece and montenegro , a new 400 kilowatt connection between elbasan and podgorica would have to be built . countries such as serbia and croatia have had a connection with international networks since the beginning of the 1990s . both sides will profit many expected that energy prices in the region will increase after these countries enter into the agreement .
but rübig says that such liberalization does n't automatically mean higher prices . " according to the concept that is currently on the table , there will be a new energy mix .
that means that there will also be competition .
and we have in the eu established that overall , where liberalization functions well , prices go down . " energy in the region is essentially produced by hydropower , coal , and natural gas .
there is no nuclear power . " the best and most efficient form of providing energy is hydropower and storage power stations , " said rübig .
" there is a chance here for investors to create sources of efficient energy production . " he adds that is a prudent choice to decide to cooperate with these countries and for both them and the eu , it is a win-win situation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia sign visa accord but energy stand-off still looms the european union and russia signed accords thursday that would make short-stay visas for travel between most of the european union and russia easier to obtain , as well as simplifying rules on multiple-entry documents .
-lrb- may 25 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

and together , they expect a liberal and privatized market will improve their energy sectors in the long run . " improving energy efficiency but southeastern european countries do n't want to only put their trust in concepts such as liberalization and privatization .
as a result , the pact prescribes exactly in detail what must be done , said paul rübig , a member of the european parliament who works on energy issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices should decrease with successful liberalization , says paul rübig " in the treaty , it states essentially that the energy efficiency is to be improved , " he said .
" that essentially means that buildings must insulate light fixtures and improve other infrastructure .
and more renewable energy needs to be used . " a new general secretariat will monitor whether the participating countries are following the rules of the accord .
it is going to cost about 20 billion euros in order to fulfil the terms of the agreement .
the world bank has already pledged a billion .
and most of the rest will be found , said rübig . " the budget of the european union will amount to about 900 billion euros by 2013 , " he said .
" and energy is an important part of it . " starting pains liberalizing energy markets has already been decided on and yet still many southeastern european countries are still reluctant . in december 2005 , the government of macedonia promised to liberalize their energy market .
at the same time , they did n't want to give up control over their energy sector , which is a state monopoly .
other countries in the region have similar outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania will have a hard time joining in because of antiquated infrastructure albania is in the most difficult situation because its energy sector has been isolated since communist times .
in order to connect with international networks , even with greece and montenegro , a new 400 kilowatt connection between elbasan and podgorica would have to be built . countries such as serbia and croatia have had a connection with international networks since the beginning of the 1990s . both sides will profit many expected that energy prices in the region will increase after these countries enter into the agreement .
but rübig says that such liberalization does n't automatically mean higher prices . " according to the concept that is currently on the table , there will be a new energy mix .
that means that there will also be competition .
and we have in the eu established that overall , where liberalization functions well , prices go down . " energy in the region is essentially produced by hydropower , coal , and natural gas .
there is no nuclear power . " the best and most efficient form of providing energy is hydropower and storage power stations , " said rübig .
" there is a chance here for investors to create sources of efficient energy production . " he adds that is a prudent choice to decide to cooperate with these countries and for both them and the eu , it is a win-win situation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia sign visa accord but energy stand-off still looms the european union and russia signed accords thursday that would make short-stay visas for travel between most of the european union and russia easier to obtain , as well as simplifying rules on multiple-entry documents .

but this time the game is so much better placed to take its rightful place among the mainstream of australian sports . soccer , so long largely the domain of australia 's sizeable immigrant communities , has seized the national consciousness with thousands staying up into the early hours of the morning , following the socceroos on television , either at home , in pubs or at large outdoor venues . the australians ' unforgettable come-from-behind win over asian champions japan , outplaying world champions brazil for long periods in a 2-0 loss and their late equalizer with croatia to advance to the second round captivated the home audience . it may have ended bitterly with defender lucas neill , for many australia 's player of the tournament , judged to have brought down fabio grosso for italy 's gut-wrenching penalty , but the die has been cast back home . australia 's domestic league inundated with registrations bildunterschrift : australia 's a-league clubs are reporting keen demand for membership tickets for the new domestic season , which kicks off on august 26 with several of the old guard socceroos expected to return home from europe and play out their careers . the saturation media coverage pushed all of the other codes - such as australian rules , rugby union and rugby league - off the front and back pages while broadcaster sbs television enjoyed massive ratings for its early morning match telecasts . one pressing problem for football federation australia is who will replace the irreplaceable guus hiddink as national coach . dutch master hiddink leaves legacy but also a gaping hole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guus hiddink leaves a confident team on the brink recruited at considerable expense 11 months ago , the master dutch coach transformed the australian national team into a confident passing team which more than matched much higher-ranked opponents at the world cup . hiddink , who now becomes russia 's head coach , instilled a sense of belief into the australian players , along with a much-needed tactical and technical organization and a team bond that was obviously apparent in their matches in germany . australian officials , greatly impressed by hiddink 's influence , want another high-profile international coach to take the socceroos further . australia can expect to improve considerably on its 42nd rating when fifa issue its next rankings after the world cup . socceroos focus on next step into the big league australia 's next international incursion will be qualifying for the 2007 asian cup finals and beyond that the 2008 beijing olympics before attempting to gate-crash another world cup party in south africa in 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craig moore and others will make way for a new generation by that stage many of australia 's long-established stars , among them skipper mark viduka , craig moore , mark schwarzer and john aloisi , will have left the national team , but the challenge will be to unearth new young talent and nurture them towards the next world cup . an extraordinary world cup statistic is that australia only led in a match for three minutes in their six hours ' of playing time in germany . yet despite all of that , the socceroos were a few seconds away from taking flagging 10-man italy into extra time and probable victory for a place in the last eight . australian soccer has come a long way in a very short space of time and the challenge now is to take it to the next level , both domestically and internationally . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in australia 's little italy , loyalties clash ahead of match norton street , in the heart of sydney 's little italy , has undergone an unprecedented green-and-gold transformation before the socceroos ' knockout clash with italy in the world cup second-round .

in the last few months , taliban forces have carried out increasing numbers of suicide attacks and the overall security situation in afghanistan has become decidedly worse over the that period of time . the bundeswehr took over the regional command of the nato isaf peacekeeping force in northern afghanistan on june 1 and currently there are just under 2,800 germany soldiers on the force .
thus far , 18 have been killed on the isaf mission . broader mandate after the attack , the afghan minister of economics , armin farhang , called on a broader mandate for the bundeswehr in afghanistan . " the taliban are also becoming active in the north , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung daily .
" the western protection forces should intervene where it 's needed .
they should shake things up more and not just observe .
otherwise , they 'll be attacked . " according to him , the taliban has reorganized itself and developed new strategies to fight western forces in the country . although northern afghanistan has been seen until now as relatively peaceful , in southern afghanistan , the security situation has been much more serious .

" in the classic media sector this kind of concentration would be unthinkable , " he said tuesday , after a two-day conference in berlin .
" it is important not to let this power develop unobserved . " google have a responsibility similar to other publishers not to allow access to illegal sites , such as those with neo-nazi content , which is illegal in germany , machill said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is on nearly 70 percent of germans ' screens when they want information making the search results transparent search engine operators ' german subsidiaries agreed to voluntarily filter sites with x-rated content or that glorify violence out of their results lists last year .
government needs to stay aware how the search companies operate and regulate them if needed , machill added . the voluntary obligation to filter sites amounts to nothing more than a " weak regulation without any sanctions , " according to norbert schneider , director of the north rhine westphalia state media institute .
he added it is up to government to make the power of search engines clear to internet users . machill also suggested starting a publicly funded european counterweight to the three us search engines that would level the search engine playing field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislation can influence what appears in search results google : we follow local laws there is no reason for added regulation or to fear explicit manipulation of search results because they are determined by a mathematical formula , according to google spokesperson stefan keuchel , adding that the only results that can be bought are labelled as advertisements . google and yahoo representatives , who for reasons of competition refuse to publish the formula that determines their search results , said they adhere to local laws when determining what results appear . " we believe in freedom of expression , not censorship , " keuchel said . both companies have , however , come under heavy fire from free speech organizations for censoring search results in china , where sites dealing with the tiananmen square massacre , tibet and independent news are censored under chinese laws . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : europe ponders digitalization of cultural heritage how should european cultural heritage be preserved in the age of the internet ?

" iran is a danger for the whole world , " wjc chairman israel singer told reporters after the one-day meeting of the us-based organization . secretary general stephen herbits said the wjc supported efforts by the five permanent members of the un security council and germany to negotiate with tehran , but believed there was no solution in sight yet .
" it is a very difficult process .
things are fluid .
people have a sense of direction , but there is no clear path , " he told a press conference .
" they must stay together and act in concert in their approach to iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization ruled out direct talks with the iranian government , headed by president ahmadinejad herbits said the international community must deal not only with tehran 's perceived nuclear drive , but with its hardline policies on a whole .
" firstly there is the nuclear issue .
but secondly we have to make iran grow as part of the world community in that it restrains its activities and engages with world organizations , " he said . the wjc leaders said they would have meetings with jewish communities around the world and with international policymakers to help to shape efforts on the middle east .
but the organization , which met to inaugurate a new policy council on wednesday , ruled out any direct talks with tehran . escalation of tensions ahead of the meeting , the new president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said iran was to blame for the escalation of tensions in the region because it has consistently backed the radical palestinian movement hamas against israel . knobloch , who is a vice president of the wjc , urged the west to isolate iran , and said its reluctance to do so was based on economic considerations . " only when iran has been isolated and that has proven successful will we see real progress , " she said . a spokeswoman for the wjc said wednesday 's meeting was the first time a newly-formed policy council for the world body was convening . appeal to hamas the wjc leaders deplored the escalation of tension in the middle east and said the only solution would be to bring hamas to reject violence so that a safe palestinian state could arise alongside israel . " we need a two-state solution but unfortunately this has become more difficult to achieve now than six months ago , " herbits said , adding that the main palestinian political movement must therefore " renounce violence and terror . "
" if you have no viable state next to israel , then israel 's ability to be a stable durable state is in danger , " he said .
interfaith dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's former foreign minister joschka fischer was invited to participate at the wjc meeting in berlin the meeting was also attended by non-members of the wjc who have worked to further jewish causes and promote a dialogue between jews and muslims , such as former german foreign minister joschka fischer and retired french politician , holocaust survivor and former president of the european parliament , simone weil . patrick desbois , the secretary general of france 's catholic bishops committee for relations with jews , said the meeting marked the first time that the jewish community had called on public figures from all beliefs to help it formulate policies . " it is without precedent , " he told afp . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german language slowly losing taboo status in israel young israelis and israeli arabs are becoming increasingly interested in learning german , something that 's been taboo since the holocaust .

other drugs are better at treating the condition , also known as hypertension , which affects 40 % of adults , it says .
the new guidance from the national institute for health and clinical excellence says using beta-blockers also increases the risk of diabetes .
but patients on the drugs are urged to keep taking them until seeing their gp .
on breakfast this morning we talked to the co-author of the report , professor neil poulter we answered your questions with the breakfast gp , dr rosemary leonard the key thing for people on beta blockers is to stay on them ... those drugs have been doing them good for a long time professor neil poulter co-author of the report dr poulter said that there are two main reasons for the guidance to be reviewed .
the first , is that the newer drugs are more effective at protecting patients from heart attacks and strokes and secondly , beta blockers are more prone to causing diabetes .
along with all the other experts , dr poulter said that there was no need to make a special visit to the gp , but that next time treatment is being reviewed , patients could then think about changing therapies .
dr neil poulter on breakfast breakfast gp dr rosemary leonard agreed that people should continue to take their tablets .
these are not brand new drugs , they 've been around for years dr rosemary leonard she stressed that it was important for people to find out , from their gp , what drugs they were using before making any decisions .
many people , she said , would already be on the alternatives to beta blockers .
and dr rosemary said that many people with high blood pressure would not even know which type of drugs they 're on .
as a short guide , she said that drugs ending in " olol " - like atenolol are usually beta blockers , whereas those ending with " opril " are usually ace inhibitors .
dr rosemary leonard - advises people to talk to their gp however , it 's vital that patients talk to their gp - and rosemary said that finding out which drugs you are taking can generally be done with a phone call to the surgery .
dr rosemary leonard answers your questions about 40 % of adults in england and wales have hypertension and in 2001 , the nhs funded 90 million prescriptions for drugs which lower blood pressure .
two million people in the uk are currently treated with beta-blockers for hypertension .
the drugs are also used to treat heart failure and angina and should still be used for these problems .
but nice now says the evidence suggests they perform less well than other drugs in treating high blood pressure , particularly in the elderly , and there is increasing evidence that they carry an " unacceptable risk " of provoking type 2 diabetes .
instead doctors should use another class of drugs , adding in different ones if a patient 's blood pressure remains high , it says .
recommendations black patients of any age or patients aged over 55 in all other ethnic groupings should be treated with a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers or drugs called diuretics .
if a person 's blood pressure remains too high - the target is 140/90mmhg - they can take a second group of drugs called ace inhibitors and if they need further treatment the gp can add whichever of the three the person has yet to take .
new recommendations in patients under 55 , first drug should be an ace inhibitor , followed by a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic , then all three in patients over 55 , or black patients , first choice should be a calcium channel blocker or diuretic , followed by an ace inhibitor , and then all three if necessary beta-blockers should no longer be used for hypertension except in patients who need them for other reasons such as heart failure patients under the age of 55 years should start treatment with an ace inhibitor .
experts were quick to advise patients not to stop taking their medication and said a discussion should be undertaken with their gp at their next routine appointment .
professor graham macgregor , chairman of the blood pressure association , said : " high blood pressure is the most important preventable cause of death and disability in the uk .
" this is a major step forward .
there are several million people on beta-blockers , but no one should stop their medication without advice .
" probably 70 to 80 % , over the course of the next year will be switched -lsb- to a newer drug -rsb- but it 's not a panic situation . "
we 're afraid we ca n't deal with any more of your questions , as our programme has now finished .
but you can watch our interviews again with dr rosemary leonard on this page .

other drugs are better at treating the condition , also known as hypertension , which affects 40 % of adults , it says .
the new guidance from the national institute for health and clinical excellence says using beta-blockers also increases the risk of diabetes .
but patients on the drugs are urged to keep taking them until seeing their gp .
on breakfast this morning we talked to the co-author of the report , professor neil poulter we answered your questions with the breakfast gp , dr rosemary leonard the key thing for people on beta blockers is to stay on them ... those drugs have been doing them good for a long time professor neil poulter co-author of the report dr poulter said that there are two main reasons for the guidance to be reviewed .
the first , is that the newer drugs are more effective at protecting patients from heart attacks and strokes and secondly , beta blockers are more prone to causing diabetes .
along with all the other experts , dr poulter said that there was no need to make a special visit to the gp , but that next time treatment is being reviewed , patients could then think about changing therapies .
dr neil poulter on breakfast breakfast gp dr rosemary leonard agreed that people should continue to take their tablets .
these are not brand new drugs , they 've been around for years dr rosemary leonard she stressed that it was important for people to find out , from their gp , what drugs they were using before making any decisions .
many people , she said , would already be on the alternatives to beta blockers .
and dr rosemary said that many people with high blood pressure would not even know which type of drugs they 're on .
as a short guide , she said that drugs ending in " olol " - like atenolol are usually beta blockers , whereas those ending with " opril " are usually ace inhibitors .

dr rosemary leonard answers your questions about 40 % of adults in england and wales have hypertension and in 2001 , the nhs funded 90 million prescriptions for drugs which lower blood pressure .
two million people in the uk are currently treated with beta-blockers for hypertension .
the drugs are also used to treat heart failure and angina and should still be used for these problems .
but nice now says the evidence suggests they perform less well than other drugs in treating high blood pressure , particularly in the elderly , and there is increasing evidence that they carry an " unacceptable risk " of provoking type 2 diabetes .

recommendations black patients of any age or patients aged over 55 in all other ethnic groupings should be treated with a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers or drugs called diuretics .
if a person 's blood pressure remains too high - the target is 140/90mmhg - they can take a second group of drugs called ace inhibitors and if they need further treatment the gp can add whichever of the three the person has yet to take .
new recommendations in patients under 55 , first drug should be an ace inhibitor , followed by a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic , then all three in patients over 55 , or black patients , first choice should be a calcium channel blocker or diuretic , followed by an ace inhibitor , and then all three if necessary beta-blockers should no longer be used for hypertension except in patients who need them for other reasons such as heart failure patients under the age of 55 years should start treatment with an ace inhibitor .
experts were quick to advise patients not to stop taking their medication and said a discussion should be undertaken with their gp at their next routine appointment .

the deal offers us nuclear technology to india in exchange for inspectors ' access to indian civilian reactors .
the house of representatives ' international relations committee voted 37-5 for the deal , which must still be put to another panel and to congress .
the agreement was hailed as historic by supporters , although critics say it will damage non-proliferation efforts .
strategic re-alignment president george w bush finalised the agreement during a landmark trip to india in march .
under the deal , energy-hungry india will get access to us civil nuclear technology and fuel , in return for opening its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection .
but its nuclear weapons sites will remain off-limits .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center the agreement reverses us policy , which has restricted nuclear co-operation since india , which has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
" this is a historic hearing , " said democrat representative tom lantos , a sponsor of the proposed legislation .
he said the importance of the bill could not be overstated and the deal signalled a " sweeping strategic re-alignment " of india 's global policies .
indian analysts lauded the us panel backing the nuclear deal .
" the world has recognised india as a responsible nuclear weapon power .
this debate is proof of this , " c rajamohan told the ndtv news channel .
the indian express newspaper said the " strong bipartisan support -lsb- in the house of representatives ' international relations committee -rsb- suggests that the political momentum behind this historic but controversial nuclear deal .. may now be unstoppable " .
' knifed ' but critics of the deal say it could boost india 's nuclear arsenal and sends the wrong message to countries like iran , whose nuclear ambitions washington opposes .
" the npt has been knifed by an executive action , " said republican representative jim leach .
" anyone who wants to present this as a happy day is making a very serious mistake . "
if the proposed deal is passed by the powerful us senate foreign relations committee later this week , it will then be voted on by the full house and senate .
the bbc 's shahzeb jillani in washington says opinion is divided in washington on whether the bush administration has the bipartisan support it claims it has on the deal .
last week , us vice president dick cheney said he hoped congress would move quickly to enact the legislation .
he said the deal was " one of the most important strategic foreign policy initiatives of president bush 's second term " .
critics believe that at a time when the stand-off with north korea and iran is deepening , a civilian co-operation deal with a country which has not signed the npt severely undermines the global nuclear non-proliferation regime .

last week , us vice president dick cheney said he hoped congress would move quickly to enact the legislation .
he said the deal was " one of the most important strategic foreign policy initiatives of president bush 's second term " .
critics believe that at a time when the stand-off with north korea and iran is deepening , a civilian co-operation deal with a country which has not signed the npt severely undermines the global nuclear non-proliferation regime .

the deal offers us nuclear technology to india in exchange for inspectors ' access to indian civilian reactors .
the house of representatives ' international relations committee voted 37-5 for the deal , which must still be put to another panel and to congress .
the agreement was hailed as historic by supporters , although critics say it will damage non-proliferation efforts .
strategic re-alignment president george w bush finalised the agreement during a landmark trip to india in march .
under the deal , energy-hungry india will get access to us civil nuclear technology and fuel , in return for opening its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection .
but its nuclear weapons sites will remain off-limits .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center global nuclear powers the agreement reverses us policy , which has restricted nuclear co-operation since india , which has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
" this is a historic hearing , " said democrat representative tom lantos , a sponsor of the proposed legislation .
he said the importance of the bill could not be overstated and the deal signalled a " sweeping strategic re-alignment " of india 's global policies .
indian analysts lauded the us panel backing the nuclear deal .
" the world has recognised india as a responsible nuclear weapon power .
this debate is proof of this , " c rajamohan told the ndtv news channel .
the indian express newspaper said the " strong bipartisan support -lsb- in the house of representatives ' international relations committee -rsb- suggests that the political momentum behind this historic but controversial nuclear deal .. may now be unstoppable " .
' knifed ' but critics of the deal say it could boost india 's nuclear arsenal and sends the wrong message to countries like iran , whose nuclear ambitions washington opposes .
" the npt has been knifed by an executive action , " said republican representative jim leach .
" anyone who wants to present this as a happy day is making a very serious mistake . "
both governments see the deal as crucial if the proposed deal is passed by the powerful us senate foreign relations committee later this week , it will then be voted on by the full house and senate .

the grand duchy of luxembourg , where arcelor has its hq , has dropped its previous opposition to the deal , and wants to own shares in the new group .
meanwhile , a group of shareholders has dropped court action to postpone an arcelor shareholder meeting over a plan to merge with russia 's severstal .

the meeting is going ahead after shareholder group adam , representing minority investors in arcelor , said it would drop its request to postpone the gathering .

arcelor had agreed a merger with severstal to fend off an unsolicited bid from mittal , but has subsequently accepted an improved 24.6bn euros -lrb- $ 31bn , £ 17bn -rrb- offer from mittal .
despite the new agreement with mittal , the severstal plan is legally binding and shareholders could back the russian deal instead .
the severstal merger proposal will not go ahead if shareholders representing 50 % of arcelor 's capital reject the proposal during the shareholder meeting .
it will also be scuppered if arcelor shareholders representing 50 % of the steelmaker 's capital tender their shares to mittal .

the grand duchy of luxembourg , where arcelor has its hq , has dropped its previous opposition to the deal , and wants to own shares in the new group .
meanwhile , a group of shareholders has dropped court action to postpone an arcelor shareholder meeting over a plan to merge with russia 's severstal .
a vote on that proposed deal will now take place on 30 june .
the meeting is going ahead after shareholder group adam , representing minority investors in arcelor , said it would drop its request to postpone the gathering .
" it is time to finish with all this confusion , " the group said .
legally binding meanwhile , helene zaleski , a board member of carlo tassara international , which holds 7.8 % of arcelor shares , told the reuters news agency that the firm would vote against the severstal proposal .
arcelor had agreed a merger with severstal to fend off an unsolicited bid from mittal , but has subsequently accepted an improved 24.6bn euros -lrb- $ 31bn , £ 17bn -rrb- offer from mittal .
despite the new agreement with mittal , the severstal plan is legally binding and shareholders could back the russian deal instead .
the severstal merger proposal will not go ahead if shareholders representing 50 % of arcelor 's capital reject the proposal during the shareholder meeting .
it will also be scuppered if arcelor shareholders representing 50 % of the steelmaker 's capital tender their shares to mittal .
on monday , the russian group said it was " reviewing its options " after losing the takeover battle , hinting it may sue arcelor for breach of contract .

carlos , whose real name is ilich ramirez sanchez , was spotted by the then head of the french foreign intelligence agency in sudan in 1994 .
but his lawyer says new details show that carlos was illegally kidnapped by french authorities on foreign soil .
he is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of three people .
newspaper interview carlos the jackal , a venezuelan citizen , made his complaint based on a newspaper interview given by the french intelligence officer in january .
speaking to le figaro newspaper , general philippe rondot spoke about his career , including the capture of carlos the jackal .
mr rondot said he called the president 's office and the then interior minister charles pasqua in paris to report his success .
carlos ' lawyer , isabelle coutant-peyre , said mr rondot 's role had long been suspected .
" concretely , this is the first time that rondot has confirmed that he was among the kidnappers , " associated news agency quoted ms coutant-peyre as saying .
