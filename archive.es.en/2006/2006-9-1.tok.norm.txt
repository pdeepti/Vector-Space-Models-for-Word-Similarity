" we take into account the experience of the past and we can not ally ourselves with ultimatums , which all lead to a dead end , " interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying on friday . " yes , there are countries whose policies raise doubts , and cause discontent , but we all live in the same world and we need to ... draw them into dialogue , and not isolation and sanctions , " lavrov added . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is being called on to keep the eu front united some german politicians , however , are n't as reserved about calling for action against teheran for disregarding the un deadline . " i understand that there is already agreement on a list of measures that include intelligent sanctions , which hurt first and foremost the country 's elites , " said eckehardt von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling conservatives of chancellor angela merkel . " it 's important to drive home to these sections of the population that international efforts are not focused on preventing iran from developing nuclear power , " he added .
" rather we must counteract official government propaganda that is fuelling such concerns among iranians . " andreas schockenhoff , a senior conservative member of parliament , urged germany and the five permanent security council members to continue to maintain a united front in their talks with teheran . " iran has n't succeeded in its aim to divide the united nations , notably the security council , " schockenhoff said .
" if we stand together and continue to isolate ahmadinejad in the future , i 'm convinced that we 'll be able to change public perception within iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.09.2006 sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler eyes iran - the country is germany 's biggest middle east export market as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions . more than 10,000 jobs in germany could be jeopardized if economic sanctions are imposed against iran , the german federation of chambers of commerce dihk said friday . " economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .

" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

dentists ' groups are worried about the commodification of health care . even as internet romances become commonplace , sweet nothings wo n't be in " bibbihart 's " or " dentist schmerzfrei 's " ears should the two who found each other at an online auction site meet .
in fact , it will be the whizzing of a dentist 's drill that commands their attention . unsure that she was getting a fair price from his dentist , " bibbihart " decided to get a second opinion , but instead of turning to the yellow pages she looked to the internet and may end up saving nearly 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,860 -rrb- if she accepts " dentist schmerzfrei 's " bid of 1,050 euros for crowning and bridging her teeth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are turning to the internet when it 's too late for an apple a day dental work has become more expensive for many germans since the public health-care system cut coverage for a number of dental treatments .
now patients who need dental work are looking for ways to save on what insurance policies used to pay for , according to claudius schikora of arzt-preisvergleich.de , which translates to " doctors price comparison . " " transparency is missing from the german health system on the price and service levels , " he said .
" we make it possible for patients to find the doctor with their idea of the best price / performance ratio . " auctions leave doctors and patients with no obligations schikora 's web site - and others like it , including 2te-zahnarztmeinung.de -lrb- second dentist 's opinion -rrb- and caredental.de - require people looking for dental work , or in some cases physical therapy and cosmetic surgery , to register anonymously and post their current doctor 's treatment plans , how much the treatment is estimated to cost and how far they would be willing to travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the bridge work goes to the dentist in the white coat then , other doctors , whose credentials are apparently checked before they can use the sites , read the plans and make their own offers in an auction for the treatment .
at the end of the auctions , which typically run for about a week , patients receive a list of the top offers and can contact the doctors .
they are n't forced to receive treatment from the lowest bidder . " patients have to realize that dentists are businesspeople , and that there are economic interests behind every medical service , " said holger lehmann of 2te -zahnarztmeinung.de. after they are treated , patients can rate their experiences on the sites .
the sites do not release the patients ' or doctors ' real names or addresses to protect their privacy . calculating the difference in the lab the prices for similar treatments differ as a result of varying laboratory costs , whether the dentist plans to create implants or bridges , which are estimated to account for two-thirds of the final price tag , and are also partially dependent on how much profit the dentists calculate in , according to german consumer magazine stiftung warentest . while supporting people in their search for a second opinion , dentists need to have actually seen inside the patient 's mouth to make an accurate assessment of what needs to be done , said reiner kern , a representative of a german dentists ' association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expense of new teeth comes mainly from the lab where they are made " auction sites give the impression that medical services are as good as any other , but you can not buy health like a new piece of furniture , " he said .
" the doctor only gets an anonymous treatment and cost plan via the internet , he does not know if any necessary preliminary treatments took place . " the auction sites could lead to dentists lowering their prices so drastically that they could only afford to continue practicing by taking on more patients than they could handle , which could eventually lead to patients receiving substandard care , kern added . all of the sites , however , point out that doctors are not obligated to fulfill their initial bids if a subsequent exam proves more work needs to be done than originally planned . " the contract is only finished when the doctor has personally advised and examined the patient , " schikora said . the internet auctions , of which some 1,400 are running , are limited to mainly dentistry , some types of physical therapy and cosmetic surgery , as most other branches of german health care set their rates according to agreements between doctors and insurers . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .

in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . "
the green vault - or ' grünes gewölbe ' , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . "
collecting instead of killing " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections .
the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works .
" the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday .

in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels .
in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . "
the green vault - or ' grünes gewölbe ' , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set .

the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works .
" the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday .

the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 .
in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels .
in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

some 50 tons of meat have been confiscated . after 10 tons of rotten meat were confiscated from a munich company 's meat locker thursday , police found between 30 and 40 tons of suspicious duck meat at another bavarian business . " the entire magnitude can not be assessed yet , " said a municipal spokesman , adding that the meat taken thursday - some of which was as much as four years past its expiration date - was " rancid , moldy and old . " the factory where the meat was found supplied customers across germany and europe , leading authorities to notify health officials in the european union as well as countries where the meat may have been sold , the spokesman said without naming the countries . testing to continue into next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police took records and meat from a refrigerating storage house outside munich tests on the duck meat confiscated friday were continuing and officials are investigating kebab stands , asian food stores and bavarian restaurants to determine if any of the meat reached the market , according to a police spokesperson . the owner of the meat factory and all 16 employees , who police did not name , were questioned . no arrests have been made as prosecutors consider the charges to be filed . officials hope to finish testing the rest of the meat by early next week , horst reif of munich 's health department told the online edition of german newsmagazine der spiegel on friday . consumer groups call for stricter laws the german ministry for consumer protection did not comment directly on the case , saying it 's too early to come to any conclusions . but the time span was long enough for other consumer protection representatives to call for tougher laws and tests . " there has to be a law for more transparency , " foodwatch 's thilo bode said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on friday .
" the names of rotten meat distributors have to be published and penalties need to be tougher or else nothing will change . " bärbel höhn , chair of the german parliament 's committee for consumer protection , told deutschlandfunk radio that tougher laws need to be put in place to ensure such cases are noticed by food control boards and that officials are n't just alerted by an anonymous tip , as was the case in munich . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu confirmed in saxon poultry the h5n1 bird flu virus has for the first time been found on a poultry farm in germany , the ministry for social affairs in the eastern state of saxony said on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2006 eu warns carmakers over exhaust emissions the european commission has threatened to impose legislation on the automobile industry if carmakers fail to respect their commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the european automotive industry has moaned for years about too many rules and regulations from brussels that make their products unnecessarily expensive . one of the touchy topics is emissions reduction .
in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .
in 2004 , carbon dioxide emissions were still at 161 grams . " the situation is not satisfactory .
i urge industry to step up their efforts .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2006 eu warns carmakers over exhaust emissions the european commission has threatened to impose legislation on the automobile industry if carmakers fail to respect their commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the european automotive industry has moaned for years about too many rules and regulations from brussels that make their products unnecessarily expensive . one of the touchy topics is emissions reduction .
in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .
in 2004 , carbon dioxide emissions were still at 161 grams . " the situation is not satisfactory .
i urge industry to step up their efforts .
we expect that industry sticks to its commitments , " said eu enterprise commissioner günter verheugen . at the current rate , the commissioner for industry and the environment fears that the car industry 's self-imposed goal will be impossible to reach . regulatory measures threatened " if carmakers do not live up to their commitment ... then the european commission would not hesitate to replace the carrot for the stick , in this case the stick could be , for example , regulatory action , " said european commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber . # b # up until now , and faithful to its policy of cooperation with industry , brussels has accepted that the automakers would respect their pledges on limiting the pollution caused by new cars . legislation would be likely to upset the sector were the commission to act , and indeed the spokesman gave no timeframe for when any measures might be taken . however , he said that the commission hoped to publish a review on the issue before the end of the year . " we are currently reviewing the whole process and the commission will act when we see that it is useful and necessary , " he said .
" if it becomes clear that the voluntary approach does not work , then the commission will step in . " private vehicles account for more than 10 percent of eu carbon dioxide emissions and its strategy for reducing them relies on carmakers in europe , japan and korea respecting self-made targets . industry association : eu too hasty the european automobile manufacturer 's association -lrb- acea -rrb- said the commission was being too hasty by suggesting it might take action . " it 's not appropriate to talk about legislation at this stage , " acea communications director sigrid de vries told afp .
" it 's too early to tell if we will reach the targets . " the acea said in a statement that european car manufacturers had significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions in recent years , with 30 percent of new cars below the target average , compared to 2.6 percent a decade ago . but the european federation for transport and environment - a brussels-based non-governmental organization - welcomed the news that the commission was finally preparing to act . " the one piece of good news in the commission report is the acknowledgement that legally-binding options to reduce emissions are now on the table , " its director , jos dings , said in a statement . " the existing voluntary commitment with carmaker associations lacks transparency and fails to punish poor performance or reward progress .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .

and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . "
the green vault - or ' grünes gewölbe ' , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . "
collecting instead of killing " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections .
the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works .
" the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday .
sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring .
the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms which have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template .
the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room " .
while the museum 's walls are still marble , decorated with mirrors and gilt , the ceiling has not been painted green this time around .
elaborate entrances its treasures escaped destruction in the allied fire-bombing of dresden in world war ii because they had been put into storage in a nearby fortress by the nazis .
the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 .
in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels .
in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .
the entire museum will open to the public on sept .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . "
the green vault - or ' grünes gewölbe ' , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . "
collecting instead of killing " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections .
the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works .
" the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday .
sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring .
the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms which have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template .
the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room " .
while the museum 's walls are still marble , decorated with mirrors and gilt , the ceiling has not been painted green this time around .
elaborate entrances its treasures escaped destruction in the allied fire-bombing of dresden in world war ii because they had been put into storage in a nearby fortress by the nazis .
the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 .
in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels .
in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .
the entire museum will open to the public on sept .

" we take into account the experience of the past and we can not ally ourselves with ultimatums , which all lead to a dead end , " interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying on friday . " yes , there are countries whose policies raise doubts , and cause discontent , but we all live in the same world and we need to ... draw them into dialogue , and not isolation and sanctions , " lavrov added . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is being called on to keep the eu front united some german politicians , however , are n't as reserved about calling for action against teheran for disregarding the un deadline . " i understand that there is already agreement on a list of measures that include intelligent sanctions , which hurt first and foremost the country 's elites , " said eckehardt von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling conservatives of chancellor angela merkel . " it 's important to drive home to these sections of the population that international efforts are not focused on preventing iran from developing nuclear power , " he added .
" rather we must counteract official government propaganda that is fuelling such concerns among iranians . " andreas schockenhoff , a senior conservative member of parliament , urged germany and the five permanent security council members to continue to maintain a united front in their talks with teheran . " iran has n't succeeded in its aim to divide the united nations , notably the security council , " schockenhoff said .

dentists ' groups are worried about the commodification of health care . even as internet romances become commonplace , sweet nothings wo n't be in " bibbihart 's " or " dentist schmerzfrei 's " ears should the two who found each other at an online auction site meet .
in fact , it will be the whizzing of a dentist 's drill that commands their attention . unsure that she was getting a fair price from his dentist , " bibbihart " decided to get a second opinion , but instead of turning to the yellow pages she looked to the internet and may end up saving nearly 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,860 -rrb- if she accepts " dentist schmerzfrei 's " bid of 1,050 euros for crowning and bridging her teeth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are turning to the internet when it 's too late for an apple a day dental work has become more expensive for many germans since the public health-care system cut coverage for a number of dental treatments .
now patients who need dental work are looking for ways to save on what insurance policies used to pay for , according to claudius schikora of arzt-preisvergleich.de , which translates to " doctors price comparison . " " transparency is missing from the german health system on the price and service levels , " he said .
" we make it possible for patients to find the doctor with their idea of the best price / performance ratio . " auctions leave doctors and patients with no obligations schikora 's web site - and others like it , including 2te-zahnarztmeinung.de -lrb- second dentist 's opinion -rrb- and caredental.de - require people looking for dental work , or in some cases physical therapy and cosmetic surgery , to register anonymously and post their current doctor 's treatment plans , how much the treatment is estimated to cost and how far they would be willing to travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the bridge work goes to the dentist in the white coat then , other doctors , whose credentials are apparently checked before they can use the sites , read the plans and make their own offers in an auction for the treatment .
at the end of the auctions , which typically run for about a week , patients receive a list of the top offers and can contact the doctors .
they are n't forced to receive treatment from the lowest bidder . " patients have to realize that dentists are businesspeople , and that there are economic interests behind every medical service , " said holger lehmann of 2te -zahnarztmeinung.de. after they are treated , patients can rate their experiences on the sites .
the sites do not release the patients ' or doctors ' real names or addresses to protect their privacy . calculating the difference in the lab the prices for similar treatments differ as a result of varying laboratory costs , whether the dentist plans to create implants or bridges , which are estimated to account for two-thirds of the final price tag , and are also partially dependent on how much profit the dentists calculate in , according to german consumer magazine stiftung warentest . while supporting people in their search for a second opinion , dentists need to have actually seen inside the patient 's mouth to make an accurate assessment of what needs to be done , said reiner kern , a representative of a german dentists ' association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expense of new teeth comes mainly from the lab where they are made " auction sites give the impression that medical services are as good as any other , but you can not buy health like a new piece of furniture , " he said .
" the doctor only gets an anonymous treatment and cost plan via the internet , he does not know if any necessary preliminary treatments took place . " the auction sites could lead to dentists lowering their prices so drastically that they could only afford to continue practicing by taking on more patients than they could handle , which could eventually lead to patients receiving substandard care , kern added . all of the sites , however , point out that doctors are not obligated to fulfill their initial bids if a subsequent exam proves more work needs to be done than originally planned . " the contract is only finished when the doctor has personally advised and examined the patient , " schikora said . the internet auctions , of which some 1,400 are running , are limited to mainly dentistry , some types of physical therapy and cosmetic surgery , as most other branches of german health care set their rates according to agreements between doctors and insurers . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2006 eu warns carmakers over exhaust emissions the european commission has threatened to impose legislation on the automobile industry if carmakers fail to respect their commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the european automotive industry has moaned for years about too many rules and regulations from brussels that make their products unnecessarily expensive . one of the touchy topics is emissions reduction .
in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .
in 2004 , carbon dioxide emissions were still at 161 grams . " the situation is not satisfactory .
i urge industry to step up their efforts .
we expect that industry sticks to its commitments , " said eu enterprise commissioner günter verheugen . at the current rate , the commissioner for industry and the environment fears that the car industry 's self-imposed goal will be impossible to reach . regulatory measures threatened " if carmakers do not live up to their commitment ... then the european commission would not hesitate to replace the carrot for the stick , in this case the stick could be , for example , regulatory action , " said european commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber . # b # up until now , and faithful to its policy of cooperation with industry , brussels has accepted that the automakers would respect their pledges on limiting the pollution caused by new cars . legislation would be likely to upset the sector were the commission to act , and indeed the spokesman gave no timeframe for when any measures might be taken . however , he said that the commission hoped to publish a review on the issue before the end of the year . " we are currently reviewing the whole process and the commission will act when we see that it is useful and necessary , " he said .
" if it becomes clear that the voluntary approach does not work , then the commission will step in . " private vehicles account for more than 10 percent of eu carbon dioxide emissions and its strategy for reducing them relies on carmakers in europe , japan and korea respecting self-made targets . industry association : eu too hasty the european automobile manufacturer 's association -lrb- acea -rrb- said the commission was being too hasty by suggesting it might take action . " it 's not appropriate to talk about legislation at this stage , " acea communications director sigrid de vries told afp .
" it 's too early to tell if we will reach the targets . " the acea said in a statement that european car manufacturers had significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions in recent years , with 30 percent of new cars below the target average , compared to 2.6 percent a decade ago . but the european federation for transport and environment - a brussels-based non-governmental organization - welcomed the news that the commission was finally preparing to act . " the one piece of good news in the commission report is the acknowledgement that legally-binding options to reduce emissions are now on the table , " its director , jos dings , said in a statement . " the existing voluntary commitment with carmaker associations lacks transparency and fails to punish poor performance or reward progress .

" we take into account the experience of the past and we can not ally ourselves with ultimatums , which all lead to a dead end , " interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying on friday . " yes , there are countries whose policies raise doubts , and cause discontent , but we all live in the same world and we need to ... draw them into dialogue , and not isolation and sanctions , " lavrov added . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is being called on to keep the eu front united some german politicians , however , are n't as reserved about calling for action against teheran for disregarding the un deadline . " i understand that there is already agreement on a list of measures that include intelligent sanctions , which hurt first and foremost the country 's elites , " said eckehardt von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling conservatives of chancellor angela merkel . " it 's important to drive home to these sections of the population that international efforts are not focused on preventing iran from developing nuclear power , " he added .
" rather we must counteract official government propaganda that is fuelling such concerns among iranians . " andreas schockenhoff , a senior conservative member of parliament , urged germany and the five permanent security council members to continue to maintain a united front in their talks with teheran . " iran has n't succeeded in its aim to divide the united nations , notably the security council , " schockenhoff said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres hans huyssen : proteus variations sergei pilyutikov : " cantus supra librum for orchestra " beethovenfest 2006 : " rossija " - russia beethoven : symphony no. 9 , d minor , op. 125 beethovenfest -pipe- 01.09.2006 eschenbach : " raising the invisible curtain " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph eschenbach is currently the music director of the philadelphia orchestra just before opening the 2006 beethoven festival bonn thursday , renowned german conductor christoph eschenbach spoke with dw about us and european differences , " sandwiching " beethoven , and the newest composers to catch . dw-world.de : what differences do you see between american and european orchestras ? christoph eschenbach : the main differences are how american orchestras and european orchestras are managed - that is , how they are subsidized .
american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .

the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2006 eu warns carmakers over exhaust emissions the european commission has threatened to impose legislation on the automobile industry if carmakers fail to respect their commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the european automotive industry has moaned for years about too many rules and regulations from brussels that make their products unnecessarily expensive . one of the touchy topics is emissions reduction .
in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .
in 2004 , carbon dioxide emissions were still at 161 grams . " the situation is not satisfactory .
i urge industry to step up their efforts .
we expect that industry sticks to its commitments , " said eu enterprise commissioner günter verheugen . at the current rate , the commissioner for industry and the environment fears that the car industry 's self-imposed goal will be impossible to reach . regulatory measures threatened " if carmakers do not live up to their commitment ... then the european commission would not hesitate to replace the carrot for the stick , in this case the stick could be , for example , regulatory action , " said european commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber . # b # up until now , and faithful to its policy of cooperation with industry , brussels has accepted that the automakers would respect their pledges on limiting the pollution caused by new cars . legislation would be likely to upset the sector were the commission to act , and indeed the spokesman gave no timeframe for when any measures might be taken . however , he said that the commission hoped to publish a review on the issue before the end of the year . " we are currently reviewing the whole process and the commission will act when we see that it is useful and necessary , " he said .
" if it becomes clear that the voluntary approach does not work , then the commission will step in . " private vehicles account for more than 10 percent of eu carbon dioxide emissions and its strategy for reducing them relies on carmakers in europe , japan and korea respecting self-made targets . industry association : eu too hasty the european automobile manufacturer 's association -lrb- acea -rrb- said the commission was being too hasty by suggesting it might take action . " it 's not appropriate to talk about legislation at this stage , " acea communications director sigrid de vries told afp .
" it 's too early to tell if we will reach the targets . " the acea said in a statement that european car manufacturers had significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions in recent years , with 30 percent of new cars below the target average , compared to 2.6 percent a decade ago . but the european federation for transport and environment - a brussels-based non-governmental organization - welcomed the news that the commission was finally preparing to act . " the one piece of good news in the commission report is the acknowledgement that legally-binding options to reduce emissions are now on the table , " its director , jos dings , said in a statement . " the existing voluntary commitment with carmaker associations lacks transparency and fails to punish poor performance or reward progress .

" we take into account the experience of the past and we can not ally ourselves with ultimatums , which all lead to a dead end , " interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying on friday . " yes , there are countries whose policies raise doubts , and cause discontent , but we all live in the same world and we need to ... draw them into dialogue , and not isolation and sanctions , " lavrov added . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is being called on to keep the eu front united some german politicians , however , are n't as reserved about calling for action against teheran for disregarding the un deadline . " i understand that there is already agreement on a list of measures that include intelligent sanctions , which hurt first and foremost the country 's elites , " said eckehardt von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling conservatives of chancellor angela merkel . " it 's important to drive home to these sections of the population that international efforts are not focused on preventing iran from developing nuclear power , " he added .
" rather we must counteract official government propaganda that is fuelling such concerns among iranians . " andreas schockenhoff , a senior conservative member of parliament , urged germany and the five permanent security council members to continue to maintain a united front in their talks with teheran . " iran has n't succeeded in its aim to divide the united nations , notably the security council , " schockenhoff said .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran .

" we take into account the experience of the past and we can not ally ourselves with ultimatums , which all lead to a dead end , " interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying on friday . " yes , there are countries whose policies raise doubts , and cause discontent , but we all live in the same world and we need to ... draw them into dialogue , and not isolation and sanctions , " lavrov added . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is being called on to keep the eu front united some german politicians , however , are n't as reserved about calling for action against teheran for disregarding the un deadline . " i understand that there is already agreement on a list of measures that include intelligent sanctions , which hurt first and foremost the country 's elites , " said eckehardt von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling conservatives of chancellor angela merkel . " it 's important to drive home to these sections of the population that international efforts are not focused on preventing iran from developing nuclear power , " he added .
" rather we must counteract official government propaganda that is fuelling such concerns among iranians . " andreas schockenhoff , a senior conservative member of parliament , urged germany and the five permanent security council members to continue to maintain a united front in their talks with teheran . " iran has n't succeeded in its aim to divide the united nations , notably the security council , " schockenhoff said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres hans huyssen : proteus variations sergei pilyutikov : " cantus supra librum for orchestra " beethovenfest 2006 : " rossija " - russia beethoven : symphony no. 9 , d minor , op. 125 beethovenfest -pipe- 01.09.2006 eschenbach : " raising the invisible curtain " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph eschenbach is currently the music director of the philadelphia orchestra just before opening the 2006 beethoven festival bonn thursday , renowned german conductor christoph eschenbach spoke with dw about us and european differences , " sandwiching " beethoven , and the newest composers to catch . dw-world.de : what differences do you see between american and european orchestras ? christoph eschenbach : the main differences are how american orchestras and european orchestras are managed - that is , how they are subsidized .
american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .

we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .

in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .

" the aim must be to make the eu 's political , economic and cultural linkages with russia , its anchorage in a greater europe , irreversible , " the handelsblatt newspaper reported friday , quoting from a foreign ministry policy paper . the ministry confirmed the plans on friday , according to german news agency dpa . the paper mooted the idea of increased joint peacekeeping missions in third countries to boost ties , handelsblatt wrote .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was expected to bring up the ideas at a meeting of his eu counterparts in finland on friday . germany will assume the six-month rotating presidency of the european union from finland on jan .

the successive terms of the two countries , which both have close ties to moscow , at the head of the eu offered a " window of opportunity " for a deeper strategic partnership , according to the paper . reorienting eu policy to the east " a pan-european peace order and the resolution of important security policy problems from the balkans to the middle east can only be achieved with , not without , russia . "
the paper referred to the current debate over controversial iran 's nuclear program in which russia has been a key player .

" in the eu we need attractive and believable offers for our neighbors … we need something like a new eu ' ostpolitik , " ' he said . the german foreign minister said the finnish eu presidency would present a report on a reorientation of eu policy towards its neighbors by the end of the year , and that he hoped germany would be charged with developing it further . the term ostpolitik refers to the policy of detente with soviet-bloc countries which was initiated in the early 1960s by west german foreign minister willy brandt , who later became chancellor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes russia for treatment of former yukos boss german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the current prison conditions of the founder of the former russian oil firm yukos , mikhail khodorkovsky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres hans huyssen : proteus variations sergei pilyutikov : " cantus supra librum for orchestra " beethovenfest 2006 : " rossija " - russia beethoven : symphony no. 9 , d minor , op. 125 beethovenfest -pipe- 01.09.2006 eschenbach : " raising the invisible curtain " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph eschenbach is currently the music director of the philadelphia orchestra just before opening the 2006 beethoven festival bonn thursday , renowned german conductor christoph eschenbach spoke with dw about us and european differences , " sandwiching " beethoven , and the newest composers to catch . dw-world.de : what differences do you see between american and european orchestras ? christoph eschenbach : the main differences are how american orchestras and european orchestras are managed - that is , how they are subsidized .
american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

" we take into account the experience of the past and we can not ally ourselves with ultimatums , which all lead to a dead end , " interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying on friday . " yes , there are countries whose policies raise doubts , and cause discontent , but we all live in the same world and we need to ... draw them into dialogue , and not isolation and sanctions , " lavrov added . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is being called on to keep the eu front united some german politicians , however , are n't as reserved about calling for action against teheran for disregarding the un deadline . " i understand that there is already agreement on a list of measures that include intelligent sanctions , which hurt first and foremost the country 's elites , " said eckehardt von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling conservatives of chancellor angela merkel . " it 's important to drive home to these sections of the population that international efforts are not focused on preventing iran from developing nuclear power , " he added .
" rather we must counteract official government propaganda that is fuelling such concerns among iranians . " andreas schockenhoff , a senior conservative member of parliament , urged germany and the five permanent security council members to continue to maintain a united front in their talks with teheran . " iran has n't succeeded in its aim to divide the united nations , notably the security council , " schockenhoff said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2006 eu warns carmakers over exhaust emissions the european commission has threatened to impose legislation on the automobile industry if carmakers fail to respect their commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the european automotive industry has moaned for years about too many rules and regulations from brussels that make their products unnecessarily expensive . one of the touchy topics is emissions reduction .
in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .
in 2004 , carbon dioxide emissions were still at 161 grams . " the situation is not satisfactory .
i urge industry to step up their efforts .
we expect that industry sticks to its commitments , " said eu enterprise commissioner günter verheugen . at the current rate , the commissioner for industry and the environment fears that the car industry 's self-imposed goal will be impossible to reach . regulatory measures threatened " if carmakers do not live up to their commitment ... then the european commission would not hesitate to replace the carrot for the stick , in this case the stick could be , for example , regulatory action , " said european commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber . # b # up until now , and faithful to its policy of cooperation with industry , brussels has accepted that the automakers would respect their pledges on limiting the pollution caused by new cars . legislation would be likely to upset the sector were the commission to act , and indeed the spokesman gave no timeframe for when any measures might be taken . however , he said that the commission hoped to publish a review on the issue before the end of the year . " we are currently reviewing the whole process and the commission will act when we see that it is useful and necessary , " he said .
" if it becomes clear that the voluntary approach does not work , then the commission will step in . " private vehicles account for more than 10 percent of eu carbon dioxide emissions and its strategy for reducing them relies on carmakers in europe , japan and korea respecting self-made targets . industry association : eu too hasty the european automobile manufacturer 's association -lrb- acea -rrb- said the commission was being too hasty by suggesting it might take action . " it 's not appropriate to talk about legislation at this stage , " acea communications director sigrid de vries told afp .
" it 's too early to tell if we will reach the targets . " the acea said in a statement that european car manufacturers had significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions in recent years , with 30 percent of new cars below the target average , compared to 2.6 percent a decade ago . but the european federation for transport and environment - a brussels-based non-governmental organization - welcomed the news that the commission was finally preparing to act . " the one piece of good news in the commission report is the acknowledgement that legally-binding options to reduce emissions are now on the table , " its director , jos dings , said in a statement . " the existing voluntary commitment with carmaker associations lacks transparency and fails to punish poor performance or reward progress .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .

but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .

three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2006 eu warns carmakers over exhaust emissions the european commission has threatened to impose legislation on the automobile industry if carmakers fail to respect their commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions . the european automotive industry has moaned for years about too many rules and regulations from brussels that make their products unnecessarily expensive . one of the touchy topics is emissions reduction .
in the hopes of heading the eu off at the pass , volkswagen , fiat , volvo and several other manufacturers agreed to reduce the output of harmful carbon dioxide emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 .
in its yearly report , the european commission was critical of the slow progress the industry has made in reducing emissions in new cars .
in 2004 , carbon dioxide emissions were still at 161 grams . " the situation is not satisfactory .
i urge industry to step up their efforts .
we expect that industry sticks to its commitments , " said eu enterprise commissioner günter verheugen . at the current rate , the commissioner for industry and the environment fears that the car industry 's self-imposed goal will be impossible to reach . regulatory measures threatened " if carmakers do not live up to their commitment ... then the european commission would not hesitate to replace the carrot for the stick , in this case the stick could be , for example , regulatory action , " said european commission spokesman gregor kreuzhuber . # b # up until now , and faithful to its policy of cooperation with industry , brussels has accepted that the automakers would respect their pledges on limiting the pollution caused by new cars . legislation would be likely to upset the sector were the commission to act , and indeed the spokesman gave no timeframe for when any measures might be taken . however , he said that the commission hoped to publish a review on the issue before the end of the year . " we are currently reviewing the whole process and the commission will act when we see that it is useful and necessary , " he said .
" if it becomes clear that the voluntary approach does not work , then the commission will step in . " private vehicles account for more than 10 percent of eu carbon dioxide emissions and its strategy for reducing them relies on carmakers in europe , japan and korea respecting self-made targets . industry association : eu too hasty the european automobile manufacturer 's association -lrb- acea -rrb- said the commission was being too hasty by suggesting it might take action . " it 's not appropriate to talk about legislation at this stage , " acea communications director sigrid de vries told afp .
" it 's too early to tell if we will reach the targets . " the acea said in a statement that european car manufacturers had significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions in recent years , with 30 percent of new cars below the target average , compared to 2.6 percent a decade ago . but the european federation for transport and environment - a brussels-based non-governmental organization - welcomed the news that the commission was finally preparing to act .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

" we take into account the experience of the past and we can not ally ourselves with ultimatums , which all lead to a dead end , " interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying on friday . " yes , there are countries whose policies raise doubts , and cause discontent , but we all live in the same world and we need to ... draw them into dialogue , and not isolation and sanctions , " lavrov added . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is being called on to keep the eu front united some german politicians , however , are n't as reserved about calling for action against teheran for disregarding the un deadline . " i understand that there is already agreement on a list of measures that include intelligent sanctions , which hurt first and foremost the country 's elites , " said eckehardt von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling conservatives of chancellor angela merkel . " it 's important to drive home to these sections of the population that international efforts are not focused on preventing iran from developing nuclear power , " he added .
" rather we must counteract official government propaganda that is fuelling such concerns among iranians . " andreas schockenhoff , a senior conservative member of parliament , urged germany and the five permanent security council members to continue to maintain a united front in their talks with teheran . " iran has n't succeeded in its aim to divide the united nations , notably the security council , " schockenhoff said .
" if we stand together and continue to isolate ahmadinejad in the future , i 'm convinced that we 'll be able to change public perception within iran .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

" economic sanctions against iran would not solve political problems , as the example of iraq has shown dramatically , " it said in a statement .
" the german economy would be severely hit in an important growth market .
the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran .

the loss of business in iran could threaten more than 10,000 jobs in germany , " it added . the conflict between iran and the international community has already generated a climate of uncertainty which was having a negative effect on growth , the federation argued . german exports to iran had fallen by 10 percent in the first six months of the current year . the dihk said that around 50 german companies had branches in iran and more than 12,000 firms had representatives there .
iran was the biggest market in the middle east for german exports in 2005 , ahead of the united arab emirates and saudi arabia .
germany exported goods worth more than 4.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- there in 2005 . no action so far the 15-member un security council took no action thursday as its deadline for tehran to suspend its sensitive nuclear fuel work or face possible sanctions expired .
a report by the international atomic energy agency concluded thursday that iran " has not suspended its enrichment-related activities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani -lrb- r . -rrb- shakes hands with germany 's ambassador to iran us ambassador to the united nations john bolton said thursday that the council would not act until after a meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani in berlin next wednesday . senior officials from britain , china , france , russia and the united states - the five permanent members of the council - plus germany , the six powers trying to resolve the nuclear standoff with iran , are also set to meet in berlin next thursday . the council had demanded that iran suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities by august 31 or face possible sanctions , with western countries suspecting that tehran 's nuclear program hides a bid to develop an atomic bomb . the six powers had hoped to win iran 's cooperation by offering a package of security , trade and technology incentives .
but tehran remains defiant , asserting its right to enrichment as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . in the first official reaction to the iaea report , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that his country " will not give up one iota " of its nuclear rights . us officials are meanwhile keen to see the council impose gradual targeted sanctions against iran , beginning with relatively symbolic steps such as bans on travel by iranian nuclear officials but then progressing to more substantial measures such as financial restrictions and trade embargoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions hurting average citizens " we 'll find out in the next several weeks whether we 're able to proceed to sanctions , " bolton told cnn television friday .
" we 're consulting with european countries .
what we 're going to aim at is the leadership of iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities . " he said efforts would be made to avoid sanctions that could hurt the average iranian citizen .
three tiers of sanctions while us diplomats at the united nations would not go into details , the new york times on thursday quoted senior officials saying the united states , britain , france and germany had been working on a three-tier menu of sanctions . the list would begin with low-impact measures including an embargo on the sale of nuclear-related materials , a freeze of overseas assets and a travel ban for some iranian officials , said officials involved with the talks .
if that failed to persuade iran , the measures a few weeks later would escalate to a broader travel ban and freezing assets of iranian government members , it said .
and if needed , the sanctions would be ratcheted up to include restrictions on commercial flights and efforts to get international banks and financial institutions to stop lending to iran . it remained unclear whether such a plan would gain the backing of china and russia , which both have extensive economic ties with iran and traditionally oppose the use of sanctions as a diplomatic tool . friday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov russia said : " we will consider a whole range of options for resolving the iranian nuclear question , but only those options that take us forward toward this goal and not those that prevent us from reaching it . " and he reiterated moscow 's aversion to imposing sanctions on iran , saying : " a way out needs to be sought through dialogue and not through the path of isolation and sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolton said sanctions could go into force regardless of the un security council bolton however reiterated friday that sanctions could be imposed outside of the security council .
" there 's a wide range of sanctions we could seek to impose on iran that do not require security council authorization , " he told cnn .
" if for whatever reason , we do n't achieve the level of sanctions we want , and even if we do , there are other things we 're going to pursue that countries like the european union , japan and others can impose by their own national decisions , " he added . the united states has already imposed a broad range of sanctions against iran . " in the area of financial transactions , investment transactions and large flows of capital there are a number of things that governments could do already under existing authorities concerning anti-terrorism legislation , " bolton said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu struggles to keep nuclear dialogue with iran alive european foreign ministers confront the diplomatic challenge of keeping dialogue open with iran and whether sanctions should be put in place after the islamic republic 's refusal to suspend its nuclear activities .

the green vault - or ' grünes gewölbe ' , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set .

american orchestras are subsidized privately through sponsoring and private donors and the european system works with subsidies from the state , the government or the city . which aspects of the european system would you like to see incorporated into the american system and vice versa ? it would be nice in the american system if the governments and states and cities were a bit more involved in culture and take more responsibility .
on the other hand , in europe we need to learn from private sponsoring because the economy is no longer providing for the so-called " specials " - media and recording and all the extras .
we can learn from both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european orchestras receive a lot more public funding than in the us american musicians work on a much tighter schedule and have much fewer rehearsals than a german orchestra , for example .
do american orchestras work more efficiently ? it 's not really the case anymore that the european orchestras , even the radio orchestras , have so much rehearsal time .
they have to work more because they have to earn money too .
you 're right ; the american orchestras have very tight rehearsal schedules and are accustomed to working with a lot of concentration and discipline in order to have an excellent product .
but european orchestras have learned that too - in the last two decades or so .
and that 's also healthy for them . the program for the beethoven festival 's opening concert included two beethoven symphonies -lrb- nr. 1 and nr. 7 -rrb- and " hèrodiade-fragmente " by the contemporary german composer matthias pintscher .
does the modern work fit in with the beethoven symphonies ? it 's more of a contrast program .
we have played all the beethoven symphonies this season in philadelphia - juxtaposing them , sandwiching them between pieces from the 20th and even 21st centuries , including commissioned works .
we 've had very good reactions from the audience .
for me , it 's interesting to hear a piece from our time between two beethoven symphonies .
the audience can reflect on the symphony they 've just heard and , in my opinion , they will certainly hear the beethoven symphony after that with different ears - cleansed ears , if i may say so .
listening to music in a fresh way - that was beethoven 's aim and should be the aim of every interpreter of beethoven .
his music is so revolutionary and so fresh that it really works in our time . the philadelphia orchestra could be termed a " traditional " orchestra in the new world .
are your audiences open to this kind of experimental programming ? one must make them open to it , and we are very successful with this .
we call it " raising the invisible curtain " between the hall and the stage , between the audience and the orchestra .
in the case of new music , i often invite the composer to come and speak .
i speak as well and present the composer to the audience so that they see that he 's not a monster who writes horrid sounds , but a human being who wants to express himself in the language of our time .
that human aspect helps to listen better to the music .
we have good success with this . about tradition … we love what gustav mahler said : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire . "
and that 's what we want to do . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gustav mahler : " tradition is not worshipping the ashes , it 's carrying on the fire " do you get the same response in europe and the united states when you mix contemporary music with traditional pieces on the same program ? in europe , the people are a bit more used to music of this kind .
in america , there 's new music but it 's kind of more " pleasant music , " which i am not such a partisan of .
it 's harder for american audiences to listen to a work by pintscher or riem , or even ligeti .
so we have to educate them to know and understand that this is very good , first-class music .
as i said before , a word or two helps .
year after year you get people more involved in this kind of music . tell us about the pintscher piece - " hèrodiade-fragmente , " dramatic scenes for soprano and orchestra . it 's very colorful , like all of pintscher 's pieces .
he works with colors , sounds and after-sounds .
there are aggressive sounds and , all of a sudden , you hear an after-sound of that .
he has a brilliant understanding of the voice and the text .
we are very lucky to have a phenomenal singer for this , marisol montalvo , who really lives this piece and projects it to the audience .
the piece itself is excellent - it 's full of drama , but also full of poetry . which other new composers do you find noteworthy ?
who should we be hearing more of on both sides of the atlantic ? the composer scene nowadays is richer than ever .
this is a wonderful sign and encourages me and my fellow musicians very much .
in every country , there is a great list of first-class composers we should hear .
in germany , pintscher is one of the younger ones .
riem is among the middle-aged and reimann is among the older composers .
in france there is dalbavie , dusapin , and others .
in england , there is adès , turnage , macmillan .
in america , there are interesting people like lieberson and thomas . not to mention the old ones in france like boulez and dutilleux , who are still enormously avant-garde - but in the best way .
these are only some people , but i could write lists and lists of first-class composers .
we have to serve these composers and their music , so that it is played and becomes known . breandáin o 'shea interviewed mr. eschenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : beethovenfest bonn : symphonies and premieres click for more information on the beethoven festival and to listen to some of the composer 's greatest works .

in form , instrumentation and scope it is similar to the symphonies of haydn , beethoven 's teacher , or even mozart . the subtle innovations in the work were more apparent to the turn-of-the-century audience than today .
it begins on a dissonant chord , for example - completely unheard of at the time .
and the third movement is a minuet , paradoxically marked " allegro molto e vivace , " a tempo much too fast to dance to . eschenbach did indeed dance , however .
his performance was characterized by a superb sense of lightness , which remained stylistically faithful to beethoven and the instruments of the time .
the pianissimos he drew out were remarkably quiet , yet never lacking in motion and vibrance . the ultimate dance by the time he completed his seventh symphony in 1812 , beethoven had matured as an innovative , cutting-edge composer .
richard wagner called the seventh symphony , with its rich harmonies and dense textures , " the apotheosis of the dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the concert , bonn 's mayor announced plans for a new concert hall clara schumann 's father friedrich wiek commented that beethoven must have been drunk when he wrote it , which presumably reflects its more non-traditional elements . beethoven himself conducted the premiere of the seventh symphony , although he was fully deaf at the time .
the concert took place in 1813 in vienna as a benefit to aid those wounded in the recent battle in leipzig against napoleon 's invading army . the audience listens to a beethoven symphony with " cleansed ears " when a contemporary piece has been played just before it , said eschenbach , and that was certainly the case thursday evening . unaccustomed sounds from an ancient femme fatale matthias pintscher 's work , featuring american soprano marisol montalvo , was based on stéphane mallarmé 's poem about the biblical figure queen herodias , who spurred her daughter salome to bring her the head of john the baptist . visual but not programmatic , deliberate but also emotional - " hérodiade-fragmente " was full of paradox and color .
its frequent pauses lent a jerky , uncertain quality to the piece .
could it be that eschenbach also revealed uncertainty , or was that only the hesitancy of herodias herself , torn between guilt and lust ? montalvo 's performance was convincing , despite the extreme technical challenges presented by the vocal part in the form of large leaps , sustained pitches in the upper register and the complex characterization of herodias . to russia and beyond what did the opening concert have to do with the theme for this year 's festival - russia ?
actually , not much .
but the festival 's strength and uniqueness is precisely its diversity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz liszt organized the first beethoven festival in 1845 some 75 events presented by 2,000 international artists are planned for the next month .
beethoven and russia may be the common thread holding it all together , but the festival goes well beyond that . the south african national youth orchestra is one of those worthwhile tangents .

the british medical association cymru is " deeply concerned " about the link between sunbeds and skin cancer .
it wants legislation to stop children using tanning salons and prevent adults from over-exposing themselves .
the welsh assembly government said it supported having strict guidelines displayed near sunbeds but added adults were free to decide their own usage .
the bma wants a bill brought in which would require sunbed operators to have a licence from the local authority .
what a sunbed bill could do prevent children using sunbeds protect adults from over-exposure ensure sunbed users are supervised end the use of coin-operated machines ensure sessions are monitored and limited provide health risk information in parlours ensure premises are inspected skin cancers are the most common group of cancers in the uk , with 60,000 new cases reported in england and wales every year .
bma cymru secretary dr richard lewis said : " bma cymru wales does not recommend tanning devices for cosmetic purposes because their use may result in acute and chronic health effects on the skin and eye .
" we therefore believe that there should be a thorough regulation of sunbed operators .
" tighter controls could have a positive impact on skin cancer prevention efforts .
" with its new powers to create new welsh law , the national assembly now has the opportunity to make a difference on this issue and steal a march on the uk government . "
he said even using sunbeds just once a month was enough to double an individual 's annual dose of ultraviolet -lrb- uv -rrb- radiation .
the risk of skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to uv light , and intense exposure is the most dangerous .
kathy banks from trade body the sunbed association said the body welcomed the bma 's recommendations which would prevent under-16s from using sunbeds , protect adults and ensure properly trained staff were always present .
" the latter would mean unstaffed salons could no longer trade , " she said .
however she added the greatest source of uv exposure came from the sun .
she said : " it is essential that due consideration should be given to people 's outdoor exposure habits if there is to be any positive impact on skin cancer prevention . "
tumours dr sharon lewis , consultant dermatologist at swansea nhs trust , said : " we are seeing more and more younger patients with skin cancer , particularly young women who are frequent sun bed users .
" in the past some types of skin cancer were only seen in elderly people , particularly outdoor workers , but now it is commonplace to see patients in their 40s and even younger with these tumours . "
the bma also hopes legislation would reduce the number of burns and accidents attributed to misuse of unsupervised equipment .
an assembly government spokeswoman said : " the assembly government supports the annual sunsmart campaign which calls for strict guidelines to be clearly displayed wherever sunbeds are used .
" the campaign would like to see all sunbeds manufactured and sold in the eu bearing a permanent statement of warning on the risks associated with use . "
she added the campaign recognised adults were free to make their own decisions about using sunbeds .

he said even using sunbeds just once a month was enough to double an individual 's annual dose of ultraviolet -lrb- uv -rrb- radiation .
the risk of skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to uv light , and intense exposure is the most dangerous .
kathy banks from trade body the sunbed association said the body welcomed the bma 's recommendations which would prevent under-16s from using sunbeds , protect adults and ensure properly trained staff were always present .
" the latter would mean unstaffed salons could no longer trade , " she said .
however she added the greatest source of uv exposure came from the sun .
she said : " it is essential that due consideration should be given to people 's outdoor exposure habits if there is to be any positive impact on skin cancer prevention . "
tumours dr sharon lewis , consultant dermatologist at swansea nhs trust , said : " we are seeing more and more younger patients with skin cancer , particularly young women who are frequent sun bed users .
" in the past some types of skin cancer were only seen in elderly people , particularly outdoor workers , but now it is commonplace to see patients in their 40s and even younger with these tumours . "
the bma also hopes legislation would reduce the number of burns and accidents attributed to misuse of unsupervised equipment .
an assembly government spokeswoman said : " the assembly government supports the annual sunsmart campaign which calls for strict guidelines to be clearly displayed wherever sunbeds are used .
" the campaign would like to see all sunbeds manufactured and sold in the eu bearing a permanent statement of warning on the risks associated with use . "
she added the campaign recognised adults were free to make their own decisions about using sunbeds .

hundreds of demonstrators hoped to disrupt operations at drax power station in north yorkshire .
offences included criminal damage , aggravated trespass and possession of offensive weapons .

he said : " there was no disruption whatsoever to the functioning of the power station . "

north yorkshire police officers and staff from seven other forces were at the power station site and the camp on thursday " to ensure that residents , power station employees and the demonstrators themselves do not come to harm , and that no laws are broken " .

drax is the biggest coal-fired power station in europe dozens of police vans were placed around the area , near selby , and fencing was put up around the railway lines skirting the plant .

drax power station commissioned in mid-1970s employs 625 people supplies 7 % of uk 's electricity needs damaged by fire in 1999 almost went into administration in 2003 amid uk power market slump revived by an unprecedented rise in wholesale electricity prices joined the stock market in december 2005 pictures of the protest about 600 people were staying at the camp for climate action , next to the power station .
drax is the biggest coal-fired power station in europe , more than twice as big as any other power station in the uk .
protesters claim it is obsolete and should be closed down and replaced with cleaner forms of power .
drax power was granted an injunction earlier this month banning unauthorised people from entering the site or using an adjacent footpath .
the injunction , to last indefinitely , was brought because drax said it did not want protesters to be harmed by the complex industrial processes at the plant .
it also sought the injunction because it said drax was an " important national strategic asset " , contributing 7 % of the country 's electricity .
drax power 's chief executive , dorothy thompson , said the company was " very concerned " about the impact of climate change but found it hard to understand what the demonstrators hoped to achieve .
she said : " what i do n't understand is how these protesters think it 's practical to shut all the coal in the uk , all coal generation in the uk , on a very short-term basis .
" what that would actually lead to would be chronic energy shortages in the uk and actually a serious shock to the economy . "

hundreds of demonstrators hoped to disrupt operations at drax power station in north yorkshire .
offences included criminal damage , aggravated trespass and possession of offensive weapons .
police said the majority were arrested outside drax but said a " small number " had gained access to the plant .
ch insp barry smith said a giant home-made ostrich had been seized by police , and found to be containing tools which could have been used by demonstrators to chain themselves to fences .
he said north yorkshire police were " quite pleased with the way things have gone so far " .
he said : " there was no disruption whatsoever to the functioning of the power station . "
' sad contrast ' mr smith said there were fewer demonstrators than the force had anticipated .
officers had been told to expect around 2,000 protesters but about 600 were thought to have turned up .
north yorkshire police officers and staff from seven other forces were at the power station site and the camp on thursday " to ensure that residents , power station employees and the demonstrators themselves do not come to harm , and that no laws are broken " .
police roadblocks were set up along all the main routes to the plant , causing long tail-backs for commuters .
drax is the biggest coal-fired power station in europe dozens of police vans were placed around the area , near selby , and fencing was put up around the railway lines skirting the plant .
following the day 's first arrests the force 's deputy chief constable , ian mcpherson , said : " this is a sad contrast to the sincere and law abiding intentions of the majority " he said the majority of the protesters were " behaving themselves " .

drax power station commissioned in mid-1970s employs 625 people supplies 7 % of uk 's electricity needs damaged by fire in 1999 almost went into administration in 2003 amid uk power market slump revived by an unprecedented rise in wholesale electricity prices joined the stock market in december 2005 pictures of the protest about 600 people were staying at the camp for climate action , next to the power station .

protesters claim it is obsolete and should be closed down and replaced with cleaner forms of power .
drax power was granted an injunction earlier this month banning unauthorised people from entering the site or using an adjacent footpath .
the injunction , to last indefinitely , was brought because drax said it did not want protesters to be harmed by the complex industrial processes at the plant .
it also sought the injunction because it said drax was an " important national strategic asset " , contributing 7 % of the country 's electricity .

it began intensifying after passing over cuba and forecasters had feared it could come ashore at hurricane strength .
but in the end ernesto passed through florida as a weak tropical storm .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- list chooses top 50 ' good people ' home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics education magazine business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 1 september 2006 , 07:10 gmt 08:10 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version list chooses top 50 ' good people ' film-maker ken loach is included in the list a list of the top 50 " good people " in the uk has been published .
the independent 's good list is inspired by features such as the sunday times ' rich list .
it recognises those " driven by an urge to make the world a better place " and includes film-maker ken loach , poet benjamin zephaniah and bob geldof .
the list also includes gee walker , the mother of teenager anthony walker who was murdered in liverpool in july 2005 .
she publicly forgave his killers .
paul vallely of the independent said : " what characterises them is that they force the rest of us to re-imagine the world in a different way .
a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify the independent 's paul vallely ' good list ' in full " unlike a rich list , which has the objective yardstick of being able to measure or estimate pounds in the bank , a good list depends upon judgements of merit .
" so we assembled a panel of experts who were asked to look beyond those who did something which benefited humanity in material terms .
" a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently .
but sir john sulston is on because he did not only map the human genome but insisted on doing so for the public good . "
gee walker publicly forgave her son 's racist killers other choices are expected to be more controversial - such as laurie pycroft , the 16-year-old boy who formed the pro-test group campaigning for the right to carry out scientific research on animals .
others , such as human rights lawyers gareth peirce and clive stafford smith , work in areas which may be unpopular with the public .
broadcaster jon snow , naturalist sir david attenborough , gay rights campaigner peter tatchell , politician shirley williams and founder of the muslim youth helpline mohammed mamdani are also on the list .
who do you think is worthy of inclusion on a good list ?
who should be recognised for their work or courage ?
some responses received so far : bill gates gives millions every year to charity although he 's very wealthy he is under no legal obligation to give anything. without his donations many charities would not be able to do as much as they do mark , uk no politicians , no lawyers , no celebs no sportspeople no journalists , no minority interests and no one who gains in any financial or career or publicity based way .
this country is full of unsung hero and heroines - the ordinary folk who do extraordinary things because they care not for any kind of reward .
gary waylett , bournemouth uk john pilger and noamh chomsky for their ability to seek out and report the truth in a world of misinformation and deceit. john entwistle , lancs england gcp , ci uk says " truly ' good ' people are hard to find " , i disagree .
' truly good ' people are everywhere in our society , they are just difficult to see & hear because they are not self-promoting .
the teacher who works extra unpaid hours to tutor children with difficulties , the volunteer manning the phones at the samaritans , the milkman who stops for a chat with an elderly & / or lonely customer , ... the list goes on & on .
look harder , they are all there in our society ... millions of them .
colin , portsmouth , uk prince charles for his charity work .
matthias , germany to me there are two candidates that stand out for similar reasons ; they are tony benn and ken livingstone .
both candidates are extremely principled and have used their positions to influence the political agenda to different degrees .
dr preetinder cheema , harpenden , england i would like to nominate mr bert massie who is the chairman of the disability rights commission for his dedication and hard work in making this world a better and safer place for disabled people .
wayne massie , liverpool , uk the queen ! 80 years of tireless service , no retirement and often in the modern age no thanks .
privileged and wealthy yes .
self promoting , no .
" good " certainly .
mark thomas , gloucester , england my nomination is for ray davies for his observations of the british way of life documented in his popular songs over the decades .
stuart harris , ascot , uk what a cringingly awful pc list .
tim , london i do n't understand why ken loach gets a placing when as they put it " a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently . "
is n't ken loach just doing his job , however excellently ?
jamie dyer , cambridge , uk i would recommend all the sunday school teachers and volunteers at my local church who selflessly give their time each and every sunday .
lesley white , scotland it 's all good and well people like ken loach being on there , but i know i 'd rather be watching ' deal or no deal ' than one of his fiercly socialist films , so where is noel edmonds ? ?
it 's a crying shame that such a wonderful human being like mr. edmonds ca n't be on the list .
alf , warwick , england rosie and john sandall of peterborough who have devoted a huge part of their life helping victims of the chernoble disaster .
sue , spalding , lincs i think that - at least in the public eye - adam hart-davis deserves a nomination .
ok , he 's a celebrity of sorts but he seems to be the most down-to-earth , approachable one to me .
dan , hull abigail witchall would definitely be on my list for her bravery and her ability to forgive .
jeb , ulverston i contrast the general weathercock of statements and policies of most politicians with the constant coherent set of values of tony benn .
pat brockman , hagley does the emancipation and rehabilitation of over 40,000 children from bonded labour count as good ?
yes ?
then i nominate kailash satyarthi .
dr , dundee , scotland should n't this be renamed the " left-wingers ' good list " ?
it 's a bit transparent .
where 's margaret who saved the country and is now cruelly vilified by many on this " good " list ?
alternatively , with gareth and clive on the list , it should be the " naive list " .
martin moore , west yorkshire brian haw is missing on that list .
marjan , london i would like to nominate dr.inderjit singh who is a regular contributor to thought of the day on radio4.his logical thoughts and interptations of sikh religion and how that serves and brings together this troubeled mankind deserve nothing but praise avtar singh paul , birmingham england i nominate john humphries especially and all the interviewers on the today programme .
' tribunes of the people ! ' and essential to ask persistently , on our behalf , the questions that others do n't want to answer .
pat allchurch , ledbury , uk another list that smacks of the liberal intelligentsia with nothing better to do .
i would question a good 50 % of that list as to the the selfish motives that put their name in the limelight in the first place .
do as an earlier respondent suggests and go look for some unsung good people in the country clive , uk not europe david walliams - yes he is a celebrity but he did something - swimming the channel - which not only raised a lot of money for charity , but also was something that required a lot of physical and mental dedication and discipline .
he did not even take time off work , he trained while also touring the country with his theatre show of little britain .
he did not just leave it at making a personal appearance or two , he did something impressive .
liz , london the founder of the world 's first childrens hospice sister frances dominica .
she is truly one of the few who restore your faith in humanity sammie , oxford , uk michael palin .
in a world saturated with news coverage of death and destruction it is so warming to have the actual beauty of the world portrayed to us by such a wonderful and witty character like him .
michael gordon , edinburgh , scotland terry waite , who is a man who lives his faith , and gordon wilson , whose daughter was murdered by the ira at enniskillen in the 1980 's - he publically forgave his killers and went on to become a member of the irish parliament in dublin .
leo , london , uk where is michael eavis ?
he has been running glastonbury for the past 30 years and raised millions for charity whilst at the same time giving pleasure to millions .
not a bad combination geraldine grant , i would nominate warren buffet for donating most of his vast fortune to charity .
peter waldron , cape town south africa the many thousands of volunteer leaders in the boys brigade and girls brigade in the uk .
i own them so much tom spalding , england as expected , the guardian good list is the usual assembly of self-serving rich celebs , overpaid lawyers , publicity-seekers and tv " faces " .
it 's easy to be a do-gooder when you are " loaded " .
what about ordinary people who " make a difference " ?
adrian martin , birmingham , uk camila batmanghelidjh for her work with young people whom others have considered " hopeless " . sylvia meek , derbyshire sir david attenborough , he has , for longer than i can remember shown us the beauty of this world and its delicate nature , he makes us all feel part of one world with no political , religous or national divides .
the man is a rare treasure .
d. kennedy , cumbria i would like to include frank field who , to me , represents a small group of mp 's who uphold the integrity of elected representatives at a time when there is widespread disillusionment with our parliamentary system. ken , uk i would nominate my dad , he does n't have celebrity status but has save hundreds -lrb- probably thousands -rrb- of lives through his work as a doctor and has contributed back to society through charitable work and voluntary contribution .
even after retirement he has kept himself busy getting a degree in forensic archaeology and doing voluntary archaeological work for societies that are preserving our heritage for future generations .
all this for very little reward , he is truly a good person .
duncan , salisbury , uk jamie oliver .
a shining example to us all .
he is an inspiration with the work that he has done with young people .
he shows huge maturity for a young man helen golding , sevenoaks , england terry wogan - a life less serious is a life to enjoy .
george anderson , market bosworth , uk having travelled a little , it is always good to return to the uk where despite the competitive pressures of everyday life , the voices of the minorities and the ' little people ' can still be heard .
it 's still largely a ' good ' nation , epitomised by the thousands of unpaid carers !
paul oliver , blandford forum , england richard dawkins ; his intellectual work criticizing religious dogma in order to benefit future generations ' morality , well-being and unity is both brave and remarkable .
his other writings concerning evolutionary theory and genetics have also contributed to a wider understanding of who we are , and where we came from .
a true gentleman .
andrew lusher , london , uk it has to be bono from u2 as he campaigns for rightous causes and is a public figure dave roden , sutton coldfield if you define a ' good person ' as someone who makes you feel positive by their very presence , and inspires warmth , affection and love just by being them , then people like michael foot , victoria wood and sir bobby robson would happily fit into this list .
sean , newcastle upon tyne great idea .
maybe one day , instead of tv programmes like the x-factor , someone will make a programme where " competitors " put forward ideas / projects to help other people and they are trained in various useful skills and the winner is awarded the resources to carry through the project .
how about this idea , bbc bosses ?
janice , leeds i would nominate george galloway for telling the truth as it is and not what the spin government of blair , wants us to believe .
thomas lowry , leeds uk truly ' good ' people are hard to find .
i could never nominate any person who is in any way in the ' public eye ' as lets face it there is always a catch and they never have any truly altruistic motives .
the thousands of unsung heroes in the medical profession , the services and the armed forces would always get my vote way ahead of the ken loachs , and bob geldofs of this world ggp , ci uk jane tomlinson , one remarkable person !
alison sanderson , west yorkshire uk i think instead of looking for the well known names you should look amongst the inner city unpaid help and support centres .
i am sure it would not be hard to find if you ask " the people " .
mrs. jackie perry , phuket , thailand what about me ? gordon mann , my nomination is nick griffin , chairman of the british national party .
he is a man who is not afraid to speak the truth and confront the political correct nonsense .
john l. rogers , vinhedo , sp , brazil i do not want to nominate an individual .
there are many thousands of volunteers across the country that should be recognised .
st john ambulance , the lifeboat association , hospital volunteer drivers etc. etc. are all good people who freely give up their own time to help others .
peter rubie , bracknell , uk good idea .
society is obsessively focused on celebs and sports stars who entertain , but usually do n't create any form of positive legacy .
we need to spend much more time recognising those that work tirelessly to make the world a better place - doctors , policemen , charity workers .

the independent 's good list is inspired by features such as the sunday times ' rich list .
it recognises those " driven by an urge to make the world a better place " and includes film-maker ken loach , poet benjamin zephaniah and bob geldof .
the list also includes gee walker , the mother of teenager anthony walker who was murdered in liverpool in july 2005 .
she publicly forgave his killers .
paul vallely of the independent said : " what characterises them is that they force the rest of us to re-imagine the world in a different way .
a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify the independent 's paul vallely ' good list ' in full " unlike a rich list , which has the objective yardstick of being able to measure or estimate pounds in the bank , a good list depends upon judgements of merit .
" so we assembled a panel of experts who were asked to look beyond those who did something which benefited humanity in material terms .
" a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently .
but sir john sulston is on because he did not only map the human genome but insisted on doing so for the public good . "
gee walker publicly forgave her son 's racist killers other choices are expected to be more controversial - such as laurie pycroft , the 16-year-old boy who formed the pro-test group campaigning for the right to carry out scientific research on animals .
others , such as human rights lawyers gareth peirce and clive stafford smith , work in areas which may be unpopular with the public .
broadcaster jon snow , naturalist sir david attenborough , gay rights campaigner peter tatchell , politician shirley williams and founder of the muslim youth helpline mohammed mamdani are also on the list .
who do you think is worthy of inclusion on a good list ?
who should be recognised for their work or courage ?
some responses received so far : bill gates gives millions every year to charity although he 's very wealthy he is under no legal obligation to give anything. without his donations many charities would not be able to do as much as they do mark , uk no politicians , no lawyers , no celebs no sportspeople no journalists , no minority interests and no one who gains in any financial or career or publicity based way .
this country is full of unsung hero and heroines - the ordinary folk who do extraordinary things because they care not for any kind of reward .
gary waylett , bournemouth uk john pilger and noamh chomsky for their ability to seek out and report the truth in a world of misinformation and deceit. john entwistle , lancs england gcp , ci uk says " truly ' good ' people are hard to find " , i disagree .
' truly good ' people are everywhere in our society , they are just difficult to see & hear because they are not self-promoting .
the teacher who works extra unpaid hours to tutor children with difficulties , the volunteer manning the phones at the samaritans , the milkman who stops for a chat with an elderly & / or lonely customer , ... the list goes on & on .
look harder , they are all there in our society ... millions of them .
colin , portsmouth , uk prince charles for his charity work .
matthias , germany to me there are two candidates that stand out for similar reasons ; they are tony benn and ken livingstone .
both candidates are extremely principled and have used their positions to influence the political agenda to different degrees .
dr preetinder cheema , harpenden , england i would like to nominate mr bert massie who is the chairman of the disability rights commission for his dedication and hard work in making this world a better and safer place for disabled people .

is n't ken loach just doing his job , however excellently ?
jamie dyer , cambridge , uk i would recommend all the sunday school teachers and volunteers at my local church who selflessly give their time each and every sunday .
lesley white , scotland it 's all good and well people like ken loach being on there , but i know i 'd rather be watching ' deal or no deal ' than one of his fiercly socialist films , so where is noel edmonds ? ?
it 's a crying shame that such a wonderful human being like mr. edmonds ca n't be on the list .
alf , warwick , england rosie and john sandall of peterborough who have devoted a huge part of their life helping victims of the chernoble disaster .
sue , spalding , lincs i think that - at least in the public eye - adam hart-davis deserves a nomination .
ok , he 's a celebrity of sorts but he seems to be the most down-to-earth , approachable one to me .
dan , hull abigail witchall would definitely be on my list for her bravery and her ability to forgive .
jeb , ulverston i contrast the general weathercock of statements and policies of most politicians with the constant coherent set of values of tony benn .
pat brockman , hagley does the emancipation and rehabilitation of over 40,000 children from bonded labour count as good ?
yes ?
then i nominate kailash satyarthi .
dr , dundee , scotland should n't this be renamed the " left-wingers ' good list " ?
it 's a bit transparent .
where 's margaret who saved the country and is now cruelly vilified by many on this " good " list ?

martin moore , west yorkshire brian haw is missing on that list .
marjan , london i would like to nominate dr.inderjit singh who is a regular contributor to thought of the day on radio4.his logical thoughts and interptations of sikh religion and how that serves and brings together this troubeled mankind deserve nothing but praise avtar singh paul , birmingham england i nominate john humphries especially and all the interviewers on the today programme .

the independent 's good list is inspired by features such as the sunday times ' rich list .
it recognises those " driven by an urge to make the world a better place " and includes film-maker ken loach , poet benjamin zephaniah and bob geldof .
the list also includes gee walker , the mother of teenager anthony walker who was murdered in liverpool in july 2005 .
she publicly forgave his killers .
paul vallely of the independent said : " what characterises them is that they force the rest of us to re-imagine the world in a different way .
a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify the independent 's paul vallely ' good list ' in full " unlike a rich list , which has the objective yardstick of being able to measure or estimate pounds in the bank , a good list depends upon judgements of merit .
" so we assembled a panel of experts who were asked to look beyond those who did something which benefited humanity in material terms .
" a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently .
but sir john sulston is on because he did not only map the human genome but insisted on doing so for the public good . "
gee walker publicly forgave her son 's racist killers other choices are expected to be more controversial - such as laurie pycroft , the 16-year-old boy who formed the pro-test group campaigning for the right to carry out scientific research on animals .
others , such as human rights lawyers gareth peirce and clive stafford smith , work in areas which may be unpopular with the public .
broadcaster jon snow , naturalist sir david attenborough , gay rights campaigner peter tatchell , politician shirley williams and founder of the muslim youth helpline mohammed mamdani are also on the list .
who do you think is worthy of inclusion on a good list ?
who should be recognised for their work or courage ?
some responses received so far : bill gates gives millions every year to charity although he 's very wealthy he is under no legal obligation to give anything. without his donations many charities would not be able to do as much as they do mark , uk no politicians , no lawyers , no celebs no sportspeople no journalists , no minority interests and no one who gains in any financial or career or publicity based way .
this country is full of unsung hero and heroines - the ordinary folk who do extraordinary things because they care not for any kind of reward .
gary waylett , bournemouth uk john pilger and noamh chomsky for their ability to seek out and report the truth in a world of misinformation and deceit. john entwistle , lancs england gcp , ci uk says " truly ' good ' people are hard to find " , i disagree .
' truly good ' people are everywhere in our society , they are just difficult to see & hear because they are not self-promoting .
the teacher who works extra unpaid hours to tutor children with difficulties , the volunteer manning the phones at the samaritans , the milkman who stops for a chat with an elderly & / or lonely customer , ... the list goes on & on .
look harder , they are all there in our society ... millions of them .
colin , portsmouth , uk prince charles for his charity work .
matthias , germany to me there are two candidates that stand out for similar reasons ; they are tony benn and ken livingstone .
both candidates are extremely principled and have used their positions to influence the political agenda to different degrees .
dr preetinder cheema , harpenden , england i would like to nominate mr bert massie who is the chairman of the disability rights commission for his dedication and hard work in making this world a better and safer place for disabled people .
wayne massie , liverpool , uk the queen ! 80 years of tireless service , no retirement and often in the modern age no thanks .

mark thomas , gloucester , england my nomination is for ray davies for his observations of the british way of life documented in his popular songs over the decades .

tim , london i do n't understand why ken loach gets a placing when as they put it " a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently . "
is n't ken loach just doing his job , however excellently ?
jamie dyer , cambridge , uk i would recommend all the sunday school teachers and volunteers at my local church who selflessly give their time each and every sunday .
lesley white , scotland it 's all good and well people like ken loach being on there , but i know i 'd rather be watching ' deal or no deal ' than one of his fiercly socialist films , so where is noel edmonds ? ?
it 's a crying shame that such a wonderful human being like mr. edmonds ca n't be on the list .
alf , warwick , england rosie and john sandall of peterborough who have devoted a huge part of their life helping victims of the chernoble disaster .
sue , spalding , lincs i think that - at least in the public eye - adam hart-davis deserves a nomination .
ok , he 's a celebrity of sorts but he seems to be the most down-to-earth , approachable one to me .
dan , hull abigail witchall would definitely be on my list for her bravery and her ability to forgive .
jeb , ulverston i contrast the general weathercock of statements and policies of most politicians with the constant coherent set of values of tony benn .
pat brockman , hagley does the emancipation and rehabilitation of over 40,000 children from bonded labour count as good ?
yes ?
then i nominate kailash satyarthi .
dr , dundee , scotland should n't this be renamed the " left-wingers ' good list " ?
it 's a bit transparent .
where 's margaret who saved the country and is now cruelly vilified by many on this " good " list ?

martin moore , west yorkshire brian haw is missing on that list .
marjan , london i would like to nominate dr.inderjit singh who is a regular contributor to thought of the day on radio4.his logical thoughts and interptations of sikh religion and how that serves and brings together this troubeled mankind deserve nothing but praise avtar singh paul , birmingham england i nominate john humphries especially and all the interviewers on the today programme .
' tribunes of the people ! ' and essential to ask persistently , on our behalf , the questions that others do n't want to answer .
pat allchurch , ledbury , uk another list that smacks of the liberal intelligentsia with nothing better to do .
i would question a good 50 % of that list as to the the selfish motives that put their name in the limelight in the first place .
do as an earlier respondent suggests and go look for some unsung good people in the country clive , uk not europe david walliams - yes he is a celebrity but he did something - swimming the channel - which not only raised a lot of money for charity , but also was something that required a lot of physical and mental dedication and discipline .
he did not even take time off work , he trained while also touring the country with his theatre show of little britain .
he did not just leave it at making a personal appearance or two , he did something impressive .
liz , london the founder of the world 's first childrens hospice sister frances dominica .
she is truly one of the few who restore your faith in humanity sammie , oxford , uk michael palin .
in a world saturated with news coverage of death and destruction it is so warming to have the actual beauty of the world portrayed to us by such a wonderful and witty character like him .
michael gordon , edinburgh , scotland terry waite , who is a man who lives his faith , and gordon wilson , whose daughter was murdered by the ira at enniskillen in the 1980 's - he publically forgave his killers and went on to become a member of the irish parliament in dublin .
leo , london , uk where is michael eavis ?
he has been running glastonbury for the past 30 years and raised millions for charity whilst at the same time giving pleasure to millions .
not a bad combination geraldine grant , i would nominate warren buffet for donating most of his vast fortune to charity .
peter waldron , cape town south africa the many thousands of volunteer leaders in the boys brigade and girls brigade in the uk .
i own them so much tom spalding , england as expected , the guardian good list is the usual assembly of self-serving rich celebs , overpaid lawyers , publicity-seekers and tv " faces " .
it 's easy to be a do-gooder when you are " loaded " .
what about ordinary people who " make a difference " ?
adrian martin , birmingham , uk camila batmanghelidjh for her work with young people whom others have considered " hopeless " . sylvia meek , derbyshire sir david attenborough , he has , for longer than i can remember shown us the beauty of this world and its delicate nature , he makes us all feel part of one world with no political , religous or national divides .
the man is a rare treasure .
d. kennedy , cumbria i would like to include frank field who , to me , represents a small group of mp 's who uphold the integrity of elected representatives at a time when there is widespread disillusionment with our parliamentary system. ken , uk i would nominate my dad , he does n't have celebrity status but has save hundreds -lrb- probably thousands -rrb- of lives through his work as a doctor and has contributed back to society through charitable work and voluntary contribution .
even after retirement he has kept himself busy getting a degree in forensic archaeology and doing voluntary archaeological work for societies that are preserving our heritage for future generations .
all this for very little reward , he is truly a good person .

the independent 's good list is inspired by features such as the sunday times ' rich list .
it recognises those " driven by an urge to make the world a better place " and includes film-maker ken loach , poet benjamin zephaniah and bob geldof .
the list also includes gee walker , the mother of teenager anthony walker who was murdered in liverpool in july 2005 .
she publicly forgave his killers .
paul vallely of the independent said : " what characterises them is that they force the rest of us to re-imagine the world in a different way .
a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify the independent 's paul vallely ' good list ' in full " unlike a rich list , which has the objective yardstick of being able to measure or estimate pounds in the bank , a good list depends upon judgements of merit .
" so we assembled a panel of experts who were asked to look beyond those who did something which benefited humanity in material terms .
" a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently .
but sir john sulston is on because he did not only map the human genome but insisted on doing so for the public good . "
gee walker publicly forgave her son 's racist killers other choices are expected to be more controversial - such as laurie pycroft , the 16-year-old boy who formed the pro-test group campaigning for the right to carry out scientific research on animals .
others , such as human rights lawyers gareth peirce and clive stafford smith , work in areas which may be unpopular with the public .
broadcaster jon snow , naturalist sir david attenborough , gay rights campaigner peter tatchell , politician shirley williams and founder of the muslim youth helpline mohammed mamdani are also on the list .
who do you think is worthy of inclusion on a good list ?
who should be recognised for their work or courage ?
some responses received so far : bill gates gives millions every year to charity although he 's very wealthy he is under no legal obligation to give anything. without his donations many charities would not be able to do as much as they do mark , uk no politicians , no lawyers , no celebs no sportspeople no journalists , no minority interests and no one who gains in any financial or career or publicity based way .
this country is full of unsung hero and heroines - the ordinary folk who do extraordinary things because they care not for any kind of reward .
gary waylett , bournemouth uk john pilger and noamh chomsky for their ability to seek out and report the truth in a world of misinformation and deceit. john entwistle , lancs england gcp , ci uk says " truly ' good ' people are hard to find " , i disagree .
' truly good ' people are everywhere in our society , they are just difficult to see & hear because they are not self-promoting .
the teacher who works extra unpaid hours to tutor children with difficulties , the volunteer manning the phones at the samaritans , the milkman who stops for a chat with an elderly & / or lonely customer , ... the list goes on & on .
look harder , they are all there in our society ... millions of them .
colin , portsmouth , uk prince charles for his charity work .
matthias , germany to me there are two candidates that stand out for similar reasons ; they are tony benn and ken livingstone .
both candidates are extremely principled and have used their positions to influence the political agenda to different degrees .
dr preetinder cheema , harpenden , england i would like to nominate mr bert massie who is the chairman of the disability rights commission for his dedication and hard work in making this world a better and safer place for disabled people .
wayne massie , liverpool , uk the queen ! 80 years of tireless service , no retirement and often in the modern age no thanks .
privileged and wealthy yes .
self promoting , no .
" good " certainly .
mark thomas , gloucester , england my nomination is for ray davies for his observations of the british way of life documented in his popular songs over the decades .
stuart harris , ascot , uk what a cringingly awful pc list .
tim , london i do n't understand why ken loach gets a placing when as they put it " a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently . "
is n't ken loach just doing his job , however excellently ?
jamie dyer , cambridge , uk i would recommend all the sunday school teachers and volunteers at my local church who selflessly give their time each and every sunday .
lesley white , scotland it 's all good and well people like ken loach being on there , but i know i 'd rather be watching ' deal or no deal ' than one of his fiercly socialist films , so where is noel edmonds ? ?
it 's a crying shame that such a wonderful human being like mr. edmonds ca n't be on the list .
alf , warwick , england rosie and john sandall of peterborough who have devoted a huge part of their life helping victims of the chernoble disaster .
sue , spalding , lincs i think that - at least in the public eye - adam hart-davis deserves a nomination .
ok , he 's a celebrity of sorts but he seems to be the most down-to-earth , approachable one to me .
dan , hull abigail witchall would definitely be on my list for her bravery and her ability to forgive .
jeb , ulverston i contrast the general weathercock of statements and policies of most politicians with the constant coherent set of values of tony benn .
pat brockman , hagley does the emancipation and rehabilitation of over 40,000 children from bonded labour count as good ?
yes ?
then i nominate kailash satyarthi .
dr , dundee , scotland should n't this be renamed the " left-wingers ' good list " ?
it 's a bit transparent .
where 's margaret who saved the country and is now cruelly vilified by many on this " good " list ?
alternatively , with gareth and clive on the list , it should be the " naive list " .
martin moore , west yorkshire brian haw is missing on that list .
marjan , london i would like to nominate dr.inderjit singh who is a regular contributor to thought of the day on radio4.his logical thoughts and interptations of sikh religion and how that serves and brings together this troubeled mankind deserve nothing but praise avtar singh paul , birmingham england i nominate john humphries especially and all the interviewers on the today programme .
' tribunes of the people ! ' and essential to ask persistently , on our behalf , the questions that others do n't want to answer .
pat allchurch , ledbury , uk another list that smacks of the liberal intelligentsia with nothing better to do .
i would question a good 50 % of that list as to the the selfish motives that put their name in the limelight in the first place .
do as an earlier respondent suggests and go look for some unsung good people in the country clive , uk not europe david walliams - yes he is a celebrity but he did something - swimming the channel - which not only raised a lot of money for charity , but also was something that required a lot of physical and mental dedication and discipline .
he did not even take time off work , he trained while also touring the country with his theatre show of little britain .
he did not just leave it at making a personal appearance or two , he did something impressive .
liz , london the founder of the world 's first childrens hospice sister frances dominica .
she is truly one of the few who restore your faith in humanity sammie , oxford , uk michael palin .
in a world saturated with news coverage of death and destruction it is so warming to have the actual beauty of the world portrayed to us by such a wonderful and witty character like him .
michael gordon , edinburgh , scotland terry waite , who is a man who lives his faith , and gordon wilson , whose daughter was murdered by the ira at enniskillen in the 1980 's - he publically forgave his killers and went on to become a member of the irish parliament in dublin .
leo , london , uk where is michael eavis ?
he has been running glastonbury for the past 30 years and raised millions for charity whilst at the same time giving pleasure to millions .
not a bad combination geraldine grant , i would nominate warren buffet for donating most of his vast fortune to charity .
peter waldron , cape town south africa the many thousands of volunteer leaders in the boys brigade and girls brigade in the uk .
i own them so much tom spalding , england as expected , the guardian good list is the usual assembly of self-serving rich celebs , overpaid lawyers , publicity-seekers and tv " faces " .
it 's easy to be a do-gooder when you are " loaded " .
what about ordinary people who " make a difference " ?
adrian martin , birmingham , uk camila batmanghelidjh for her work with young people whom others have considered " hopeless " . sylvia meek , derbyshire sir david attenborough , he has , for longer than i can remember shown us the beauty of this world and its delicate nature , he makes us all feel part of one world with no political , religous or national divides .
the man is a rare treasure .
d. kennedy , cumbria i would like to include frank field who , to me , represents a small group of mp 's who uphold the integrity of elected representatives at a time when there is widespread disillusionment with our parliamentary system. ken , uk i would nominate my dad , he does n't have celebrity status but has save hundreds -lrb- probably thousands -rrb- of lives through his work as a doctor and has contributed back to society through charitable work and voluntary contribution .
even after retirement he has kept himself busy getting a degree in forensic archaeology and doing voluntary archaeological work for societies that are preserving our heritage for future generations .
all this for very little reward , he is truly a good person .
duncan , salisbury , uk jamie oliver .
a shining example to us all .
he is an inspiration with the work that he has done with young people .
he shows huge maturity for a young man helen golding , sevenoaks , england terry wogan - a life less serious is a life to enjoy .
george anderson , market bosworth , uk having travelled a little , it is always good to return to the uk where despite the competitive pressures of everyday life , the voices of the minorities and the ' little people ' can still be heard .
it 's still largely a ' good ' nation , epitomised by the thousands of unpaid carers !
paul oliver , blandford forum , england richard dawkins ; his intellectual work criticizing religious dogma in order to benefit future generations ' morality , well-being and unity is both brave and remarkable .
his other writings concerning evolutionary theory and genetics have also contributed to a wider understanding of who we are , and where we came from .
a true gentleman .
andrew lusher , london , uk it has to be bono from u2 as he campaigns for rightous causes and is a public figure dave roden , sutton coldfield if you define a ' good person ' as someone who makes you feel positive by their very presence , and inspires warmth , affection and love just by being them , then people like michael foot , victoria wood and sir bobby robson would happily fit into this list .
sean , newcastle upon tyne great idea .
maybe one day , instead of tv programmes like the x-factor , someone will make a programme where " competitors " put forward ideas / projects to help other people and they are trained in various useful skills and the winner is awarded the resources to carry through the project .
how about this idea , bbc bosses ?
janice , leeds i would nominate george galloway for telling the truth as it is and not what the spin government of blair , wants us to believe .
thomas lowry , leeds uk truly ' good ' people are hard to find .
i could never nominate any person who is in any way in the ' public eye ' as lets face it there is always a catch and they never have any truly altruistic motives .
the thousands of unsung heroes in the medical profession , the services and the armed forces would always get my vote way ahead of the ken loachs , and bob geldofs of this world ggp , ci uk jane tomlinson , one remarkable person !
alison sanderson , west yorkshire uk i think instead of looking for the well known names you should look amongst the inner city unpaid help and support centres .
i am sure it would not be hard to find if you ask " the people " .
mrs. jackie perry , phuket , thailand what about me ? gordon mann , my nomination is nick griffin , chairman of the british national party .
he is a man who is not afraid to speak the truth and confront the political correct nonsense .
john l. rogers , vinhedo , sp , brazil i do not want to nominate an individual .
there are many thousands of volunteers across the country that should be recognised .
st john ambulance , the lifeboat association , hospital volunteer drivers etc. etc. are all good people who freely give up their own time to help others .
peter rubie , bracknell , uk good idea .
society is obsessively focused on celebs and sports stars who entertain , but usually do n't create any form of positive legacy .
we need to spend much more time recognising those that work tirelessly to make the world a better place - doctors , policemen , charity workers .

gee walker publicly forgave her son 's racist killers other choices are expected to be more controversial - such as laurie pycroft , the 16-year-old boy who formed the pro-test group campaigning for the right to carry out scientific research on animals .
others , such as human rights lawyers gareth peirce and clive stafford smith , work in areas which may be unpopular with the public .
broadcaster jon snow , naturalist sir david attenborough , gay rights campaigner peter tatchell , politician shirley williams and founder of the muslim youth helpline mohammed mamdani are also on the list .
who do you think is worthy of inclusion on a good list ?
who should be recognised for their work or courage ?
some responses received so far : bill gates gives millions every year to charity although he 's very wealthy he is under no legal obligation to give anything. without his donations many charities would not be able to do as much as they do mark , uk no politicians , no lawyers , no celebs no sportspeople no journalists , no minority interests and no one who gains in any financial or career or publicity based way .
this country is full of unsung hero and heroines - the ordinary folk who do extraordinary things because they care not for any kind of reward .
gary waylett , bournemouth uk john pilger and noamh chomsky for their ability to seek out and report the truth in a world of misinformation and deceit. john entwistle , lancs england gcp , ci uk says " truly ' good ' people are hard to find " , i disagree .
' truly good ' people are everywhere in our society , they are just difficult to see & hear because they are not self-promoting .
the teacher who works extra unpaid hours to tutor children with difficulties , the volunteer manning the phones at the samaritans , the milkman who stops for a chat with an elderly & / or lonely customer , ... the list goes on & on .
look harder , they are all there in our society ... millions of them .
colin , portsmouth , uk prince charles for his charity work .
matthias , germany to me there are two candidates that stand out for similar reasons ; they are tony benn and ken livingstone .
both candidates are extremely principled and have used their positions to influence the political agenda to different degrees .
dr preetinder cheema , harpenden , england i would like to nominate mr bert massie who is the chairman of the disability rights commission for his dedication and hard work in making this world a better and safer place for disabled people .
wayne massie , liverpool , uk the queen ! 80 years of tireless service , no retirement and often in the modern age no thanks .
privileged and wealthy yes .
self promoting , no .
" good " certainly .
mark thomas , gloucester , england my nomination is for ray davies for his observations of the british way of life documented in his popular songs over the decades .
stuart harris , ascot , uk what a cringingly awful pc list .
tim , london i do n't understand why ken loach gets a placing when as they put it " a scientist who made a breakthrough in cancer treatment would not qualify - he would just be doing his job , however excellently . "
is n't ken loach just doing his job , however excellently ?
jamie dyer , cambridge , uk i would recommend all the sunday school teachers and volunteers at my local church who selflessly give their time each and every sunday .
lesley white , scotland it 's all good and well people like ken loach being on there , but i know i 'd rather be watching ' deal or no deal ' than one of his fiercly socialist films , so where is noel edmonds ? ?
it 's a crying shame that such a wonderful human being like mr. edmonds ca n't be on the list .
alf , warwick , england rosie and john sandall of peterborough who have devoted a huge part of their life helping victims of the chernoble disaster .
sue , spalding , lincs i think that - at least in the public eye - adam hart-davis deserves a nomination .
ok , he 's a celebrity of sorts but he seems to be the most down-to-earth , approachable one to me .
dan , hull abigail witchall would definitely be on my list for her bravery and her ability to forgive .
jeb , ulverston i contrast the general weathercock of statements and policies of most politicians with the constant coherent set of values of tony benn .
pat brockman , hagley does the emancipation and rehabilitation of over 40,000 children from bonded labour count as good ?
yes ?
then i nominate kailash satyarthi .
dr , dundee , scotland should n't this be renamed the " left-wingers ' good list " ?
it 's a bit transparent .
where 's margaret who saved the country and is now cruelly vilified by many on this " good " list ?
alternatively , with gareth and clive on the list , it should be the " naive list " .
martin moore , west yorkshire brian haw is missing on that list .
marjan , london i would like to nominate dr.inderjit singh who is a regular contributor to thought of the day on radio4.his logical thoughts and interptations of sikh religion and how that serves and brings together this troubeled mankind deserve nothing but praise avtar singh paul , birmingham england i nominate john humphries especially and all the interviewers on the today programme .
' tribunes of the people ! ' and essential to ask persistently , on our behalf , the questions that others do n't want to answer .
pat allchurch , ledbury , uk another list that smacks of the liberal intelligentsia with nothing better to do .
i would question a good 50 % of that list as to the the selfish motives that put their name in the limelight in the first place .
do as an earlier respondent suggests and go look for some unsung good people in the country clive , uk not europe david walliams - yes he is a celebrity but he did something - swimming the channel - which not only raised a lot of money for charity , but also was something that required a lot of physical and mental dedication and discipline .
he did not even take time off work , he trained while also touring the country with his theatre show of little britain .
he did not just leave it at making a personal appearance or two , he did something impressive .
liz , london the founder of the world 's first childrens hospice sister frances dominica .
she is truly one of the few who restore your faith in humanity sammie , oxford , uk michael palin .
in a world saturated with news coverage of death and destruction it is so warming to have the actual beauty of the world portrayed to us by such a wonderful and witty character like him .
michael gordon , edinburgh , scotland terry waite , who is a man who lives his faith , and gordon wilson , whose daughter was murdered by the ira at enniskillen in the 1980 's - he publically forgave his killers and went on to become a member of the irish parliament in dublin .
leo , london , uk where is michael eavis ?
he has been running glastonbury for the past 30 years and raised millions for charity whilst at the same time giving pleasure to millions .
not a bad combination geraldine grant , i would nominate warren buffet for donating most of his vast fortune to charity .
peter waldron , cape town south africa the many thousands of volunteer leaders in the boys brigade and girls brigade in the uk .
i own them so much tom spalding , england as expected , the guardian good list is the usual assembly of self-serving rich celebs , overpaid lawyers , publicity-seekers and tv " faces " .
it 's easy to be a do-gooder when you are " loaded " .
what about ordinary people who " make a difference " ?
adrian martin , birmingham , uk camila batmanghelidjh for her work with young people whom others have considered " hopeless " . sylvia meek , derbyshire sir david attenborough , he has , for longer than i can remember shown us the beauty of this world and its delicate nature , he makes us all feel part of one world with no political , religous or national divides .
the man is a rare treasure .
d. kennedy , cumbria i would like to include frank field who , to me , represents a small group of mp 's who uphold the integrity of elected representatives at a time when there is widespread disillusionment with our parliamentary system. ken , uk i would nominate my dad , he does n't have celebrity status but has save hundreds -lrb- probably thousands -rrb- of lives through his work as a doctor and has contributed back to society through charitable work and voluntary contribution .
even after retirement he has kept himself busy getting a degree in forensic archaeology and doing voluntary archaeological work for societies that are preserving our heritage for future generations .
all this for very little reward , he is truly a good person .
duncan , salisbury , uk jamie oliver .
a shining example to us all .
he is an inspiration with the work that he has done with young people .
he shows huge maturity for a young man helen golding , sevenoaks , england terry wogan - a life less serious is a life to enjoy .
george anderson , market bosworth , uk having travelled a little , it is always good to return to the uk where despite the competitive pressures of everyday life , the voices of the minorities and the ' little people ' can still be heard .
it 's still largely a ' good ' nation , epitomised by the thousands of unpaid carers !
paul oliver , blandford forum , england richard dawkins ; his intellectual work criticizing religious dogma in order to benefit future generations ' morality , well-being and unity is both brave and remarkable .
his other writings concerning evolutionary theory and genetics have also contributed to a wider understanding of who we are , and where we came from .
a true gentleman .
andrew lusher , london , uk it has to be bono from u2 as he campaigns for rightous causes and is a public figure dave roden , sutton coldfield if you define a ' good person ' as someone who makes you feel positive by their very presence , and inspires warmth , affection and love just by being them , then people like michael foot , victoria wood and sir bobby robson would happily fit into this list .
sean , newcastle upon tyne great idea .
maybe one day , instead of tv programmes like the x-factor , someone will make a programme where " competitors " put forward ideas / projects to help other people and they are trained in various useful skills and the winner is awarded the resources to carry through the project .
how about this idea , bbc bosses ?
janice , leeds i would nominate george galloway for telling the truth as it is and not what the spin government of blair , wants us to believe .
thomas lowry , leeds uk truly ' good ' people are hard to find .
i could never nominate any person who is in any way in the ' public eye ' as lets face it there is always a catch and they never have any truly altruistic motives .
the thousands of unsung heroes in the medical profession , the services and the armed forces would always get my vote way ahead of the ken loachs , and bob geldofs of this world ggp , ci uk jane tomlinson , one remarkable person !
alison sanderson , west yorkshire uk i think instead of looking for the well known names you should look amongst the inner city unpaid help and support centres .
i am sure it would not be hard to find if you ask " the people " .
mrs. jackie perry , phuket , thailand what about me ? gordon mann , my nomination is nick griffin , chairman of the british national party .
he is a man who is not afraid to speak the truth and confront the political correct nonsense .
john l. rogers , vinhedo , sp , brazil i do not want to nominate an individual .
there are many thousands of volunteers across the country that should be recognised .
st john ambulance , the lifeboat association , hospital volunteer drivers etc. etc. are all good people who freely give up their own time to help others .
peter rubie , bracknell , uk good idea .
society is obsessively focused on celebs and sports stars who entertain , but usually do n't create any form of positive legacy .
we need to spend much more time recognising those that work tirelessly to make the world a better place - doctors , policemen , charity workers .

the us , in particular , blames the weak value of china 's yuan for an explosion in exports and a big part of its huge trade deficit , which hit a record $ 805bn -lrb- £ 423bn -rrb- last year .
" it is in china 's interests to implement more forcefully the exchange regime it gave itself last year and let market forces determine things in china in a more clear way , certainly the value of the currency , " said mr de rato .
the changes were approved by the 24 imf directors on thursday , but final approval will need to be sought at the fund 's annual meeting in singapore on from 19-20 september .
the 184-member imf said it would also work on changing the voting rights , or quotas , of more emerging countries , and take measures to ensure that poorer , mainly african economies would also be represented .

the international monetary fund plans to give china , south korea , turkey and mexico more voting power to reflect their growing economic importance .
the fund , set up after world war ii , lends money to emerging nations , usually in return for economic reforms .
critics have said it fails to represent the needs of most developing countries .
currency revaluation the changes being proposed would give the four countries voting rights more in line with their weight in the global economy .
at the moment belgium has more voting power than brazil , india , mexico or south korea , despite having a much smaller economy .
" i think that all members recognise that relevant quotas and voting shares do not adequately respond to the reality of the world economy , " imf managing director rodrigo de rato said .
us critics claimed china kept the yuan low to boost exports in return for giving them a greater say in decision-making , the imf hopes that china and other fast-developing economies will listen to calls to revalue their currency .
the us , in particular , blames the weak value of china 's yuan for an explosion in exports and a big part of its huge trade deficit , which hit a record $ 805bn -lrb- £ 423bn -rrb- last year .
" it is in china 's interests to implement more forcefully the exchange regime it gave itself last year and let market forces determine things in china in a more clear way , certainly the value of the currency , " said mr de rato .
the changes were approved by the 24 imf directors on thursday , but final approval will need to be sought at the fund 's annual meeting in singapore on from 19-20 september .
the 184-member imf said it would also work on changing the voting rights , or quotas , of more emerging countries , and take measures to ensure that poorer , mainly african economies would also be represented .
