since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmer martin wucher is one of namibia 's german speaking minority editor doro greve said she thinks it is very important to cover namibian topics and make an effort to get away from purely german news .

i think it is our job to slowly but surely bring the readers up to the present time and say , ' hey , this is namibia today .

because we see quite often that german speakers do n't really want to get involved and open up to the public .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .

that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .

and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .

it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2006 namibia 's german newspaper still a cultural icon at 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allgemeine zeitung and stefan fischer , its editor-in-chief this year , namibia 's oldest daily newspaper celebrates its 90th birthday .
since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .
" land reform , criminality , sometimes natural phenomena , like our rainy season .
and , oh yeah , the budget , and the fight against corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmer martin wucher is one of namibia 's german speaking minority editor doro greve said she thinks it is very important to cover namibian topics and make an effort to get away from purely german news . " i sometimes think some of our readers are a little bit stuck in the 1980s .
i think it is our job to slowly but surely bring the readers up to the present time and say , ' hey , this is namibia today .
this is new !

" what we expect is an immediate cease-fire and the application of what was demanded ... that is the setting up of humanitarian corridors , " one eu diplomat said on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks . " almost all the europeans want a truce or a cease-fire . " britain joins us in calling for un force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops in lebanon would be given peacekeeping powers britain , with its close ally the united states , has pushed instead for agreement at the united nations to deploy an international force to secure the israel-lebanon border and ensure that any cease-fire is sustainable . but finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu presidency , said in helsinki that agreement including britain was possible . " i expect the eu to be able to act with consensus including great britain , " he told journalists .
" there have also been discussions with the british prime minister , " he said . france for its part is seeking to seize the diplomatic initiative . foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said monday that a " cease-fire is a priority and an urgent request .
we need an immediate cease-fire and an end to the -lrb- israeli -rrb- blockade . " an eu official noted : " there are always different sensitivities among member states , but this is something we have to live with and try to be as effective as possible . " tuesday 's meeting comes after israel announced the suspension of air strikes for 48 hours after its war planes killed 52 civilians , about 30 of them children according to police , in the lebanese village of qana .
the eu has condemned the attack . in all , the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon since israel launched its air , sea and land assault after hezbollah seized two of its soldiers on july 12 . hezbollah fighters meanwhile have fired between 1,700 and 1,900 rockets at northern israel , killing some 18 civilians and wounding more than 300 people . cease-fire and aid to be discussed a german government spokesman said monday that the pause in air strikes - called to investigate the qana killings - is " a positive sign " that a lasting cease-fire could be within reach . during their talks , the ministers will be briefed by external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who just returned from a trip to the region , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has agreed safe passage for food and medicine aid efforts will also figure high on the agenda , following the european commission 's announcement last week of a further 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to help the victims . " we would like to see the new member states committing more humanitarian aid .
i think they will do , because there is a lot of pressure from public opinion , " said amadeu altafaj , spokesman on eu aid issues . as an aid provider , the bloc has influence with lebanon and the palestinians - also up for discussion tuesday - but it holds little sway with israel and is reluctant to compromise what small leverage it has . the foreign ministers are not expected to draw up formal conclusions but want to show that the eu " remains active " on the crisis and that its members are " in phase , " another eu diplomat said . " it 's obvious that we have to move very quickly now .
what the european union can do additionally in political terms is to keep pressure on the timetable ... add a sense of urgency , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers .

it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "

" the suspension of our aerial activities does not signify in any way the end to the war , " ramon told israeli army radio . " on the contrary , this decision will allow us to win this war and lessen international pressure . " to stop the war at this stage would mean a victory for hezbollah and for international terrorism , manipulated by iran and syria , " added ramon , who is considered close to prime minister ehud olmert and is a member of the nation 's security cabinet . another cabinet member considered close to olmert , minister of immigrant absorption zeev boim , told public radio that the suspension in aerial attacks was " temporary and limited . " " we took this decision to take into account the interests of the united states , our loyal and courageous ally that finds itself in a difficult position because of its support of israel , " boim said . boim added the halt in air attacks would not apply " if we see attempts by the hezbollah to restock itself with arms and rockets from syria . " hassan fadlallah , a hezbollah member of parliament , said a limited suspension of israeli air strikes into lebanon was not enough to halt the conflict with the shiite muslim group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel will continue its ground offensive " the war will end when israel stops its aggression comprehensively and totally and pulls out from the points -lrb- its ground forces -rrb- entered in south lebanon , " fadlallah told reuters . " if the aim of israel 's decision to suspend air raids is to absorb the international outrage over the qana massacre and then proceed with ground bombardment , that means israel has not stopped its aggression , " fadlallah added . britain , germany welcome suspension british prime minister tony blair welcomed the temporary halt to the israeli bombardment of lebanon , saying he was optimistic of the chances of an end to hostilities . " what 's important now is that we have a real chance of getting a united nations security council resolution which will give us the opportunity both to have the complete cessation of hostilities , not merely a temporary one , but on a sustainable , lasting basis , " said blair . " what has happened to qana shows that this is a situation that simply can not continue , " he added .
" i 've been conducting a serious of urgent course negotiations with other leaders .
i 've also spoken to prime minister siniora of the lebanon .
i think there is a basis for an agreement that would allow us to get a un resolution . . hostilities have got to stop .
and stop on all sides . "
gernot erler , a german deputy foreign minister , said on germany 's zdf television that the suspension of air strikes was a sign that the united states was beginning to exert its influence with positive effects in the middle east crisis . " what -lrb- us secretary of state -rrb- condoleezza rice achieved in israel in the last few hours is far more than one could actually expect , and we also have the impression that great pressure is now being exercised by america , " erler said . " i think that , in america , there is an understanding of the danger to the standing of both israel and america that is linked with qana , with this tragedy , " he added . qa n a bombi n g leads to limited ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of civilians were killed in the war 's deadliest strike the announcement of the suspension of air strikes came after the un security council held an emergency meeting after israeli bombs struck a building in the southern lebanese village of qana , killing dozens of civilians , many of them children sunday 's strike , the deadliest yet , prompted rice to call for a un resolution that could bring about a complete halt to fighting . the bloodshed in qana , which israel said was accidental , has triggered outrage across the world and increased international pressure on the united states to back an immediate end to the fighting . rice believes full ceasefire i n sight after a long night of discussions in jerusalem , rice said a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah could be achieved this week .
world powers will meet again on monday to discuss the next possible developments in the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with israel 's prime minister ehud olmert rice said during her discussions with top israeli officials she had found consensus on several issues that she thinks could form the political basis for a solution to the crisis . but the statements from israel regarding the 48-hour air strike suspension suggested there was no indication from israeli politicians that they were actually willing to agree to an immediate and complete ceasefire . israel urged to stop the war international criticism is growing and many leaders have demanded more urgency from israel to stop the fighting . france , germany and several other western nations have also called for an immediate ceasefire in the region . meanwhile , israeli air strikes hit eastern lebanon early on monday , with two raids near the syrian border .
however , israel said the strikes had been carried out before the 48-hour suspension came into effect . when the members of the un security council meet this week , they will also discuss the establishment of an international stabilization force . the force would then be deployed as soon as possible after a un resolution and create a buffer zone between southern lebanon and israel . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we barely escaped death " a german-lebanese family from the town of lünen found themselves under israeli bombardment .

of the victims , some 37 were children .
the european press reacted harshly monday to the deadly offensive . the bombing of qana " fatally reminds us of the 102 civilians who were killed by israeli grenades in a unifil -lrb- united nations interim force in lebanon -rrb- camp in 1996 in the very same place , " wrote germany 's die tageszeitu n g .
israel 's rhetoric and the reaction of the international community are the same as they were 10 years ago , according to the paper .
an immediate , unconditional ceasefire would mean victory for hezbollah .
" without hasty military success , qana 2006 could become for the israeli army what qana 1996 became : the writing on the wall that preceded its withdrawal from lebanon . " " this bloodbath is only creating more hate , more terrorism , " wrote belgium 's le soir .
" if it continues like this , all the lebanese people will soon find themselves under the banner of the hezbollah . "
the events in qana could repeat themselves , continued the paper , and perhaps hezbollah will manage to bomb tel aviv .
" and then what response would it take to even up the score ?
let us stop here .
please , stop ! " " the blood from qana has splattered on everyone 's face , " wrote la repubblica in italy .
" it 's the blood of the innocent , " which has revealed the raw horror of this conflict , " and wo n't be easy to wipe it off . "
lebanon is a country that is harboring an " untamed guerilla , " continued the paper , but which is also " practically the only democratic society in the arab world .
blood has rained down on all those who are responsible for it : the direct and indirect protagonists , but also the powerful and powerless by-standers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 civilians were killed in israel 's 1996 attack on qana " the events in lebanon not only show that there is no longer a real anti-terror coalition in today 's world .
as paradoxical as it may sound , there is n't a war against terrorism either , " wrote russia 's kommersa n t .
" if , in a war like that in lebanon , which is conducted with the most modern and accurate weapons , 10 times as many children are killed as armed men , it can no longer be called a war against terrorism . " " moral justification for the use of violence is demanded of democracies , " wrote the dutch newspaper de volkskra n t , " or else the violence can be turned back on the perpetrators , which now seems to be the case . "
it would not be wise for israel to cultivate a camp mentality and hide behind its own moral correctness , according to the paper .
instead , " israel has to make use of the moment to critically examine its conduct and ask itself whether the disadvantages are gradually starting to outweigh the advantages . "
the us should insist on this , continued the paper .
" qana should be a turning point after three weeks of war , and the casualties there should be the last .

sunday 's poll put her approval rating at 54 percent .
those unhappy with the chancellor rose to 45 percent from 35 percent in the previous poll . merkel enjoyed a sustained early popularity rating due to a round of highly impressive performances on the international stage and a pragmatic approach to domestic governance at home .

that means higher turnover in the tourism industry , experts say . germany has been the most popular destination for vacationing germans in the past few years .
record temperatures and endless blue skies make the country even more attractive for nationals seeking relaxation . " germany is profiting from the hot summer , " sibylle zeuch , spokeswoman for the german travel association , which represents 5,000 different travel agencies and organizers , told the netzeitu n g . zeuch added that in the past few years , about one third of the trips that germans took lasting longer than five days were spent inland . " this trend will see a significant increase this year with the hot summer we 've been having , " she said . " germa n y has ma n y special attractio n s " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the beach is my castle " thilo braune , president of the german tourism association , said many regions in germany have not exhausted their capacity . " germany has so much to offer , " he said .
" there are special attractions everywhere , but often they are not marketed well enough . " high marketing costs are prohibitive and regional web sites are still inadequate , he added . claudia gilles , managing director of the german travel association , told netzeitu n g that the seaside is a magnet for germans vacationing in their home country . " campgrounds on the north and baltic seas are packed right now , " she said . she also expects the beautiful weather to have a positive effect on germany 's tourism economy .
however , precise figures on the number of booked overnight stays within the country will not be reported until october . " the baltic sea may replace the mediterra n ea n as a vacatio n spot " theo eberhard , a professor of tourism at the university of applied sciences in munich , expects the trend to increase .
since global warming is likely to continue causing heat waves in central europe , he said , eastern europe is becoming an attractive destination for traveling germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's beaches could soon get a run for their money " germans follow the sun , " he said .
" but if the sun gets too hot for them , they avoid the south and head east . " once germans start feeling the baltic climate to be more pleasant than that of the mediterranean , the demand for vacations in baltic countries will grow , he added . people from all over europe may also start following the trend , he added . " but we 'll just have to wait and see what happens , " he said .
" tourism is like a traveling circus .
it changes all the time .
people 's travel habits change as quickly as consumer behavior does .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .

that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .

and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" he had with his concept created the perfect synthesis between modern architecture and the building 's historical roots .
it mirrors the history of this building and its present and future through its design . " arriving in the present thierse , formerly president of the bundestag , was there that day in april 1999 , when the first meeting of the parliament opened in the rebuilt reichstag .
it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .

that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .

since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .

i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .

i think it is our job to slowly but surely bring the readers up to the present time and say , ' hey , this is namibia today .

because we see quite often that german speakers do n't really want to get involved and open up to the public .

sunday 's poll put her approval rating at 54 percent .
those unhappy with the chancellor rose to 45 percent from 35 percent in the previous poll . merkel enjoyed a sustained early popularity rating due to a round of highly impressive performances on the international stage and a pragmatic approach to domestic governance at home .
the dip in approval could be attributed to the overall performance of her government , the survey suggested . germa n s see cha n cellor as " importa n t " more encouragingly , 70 percent of germans wanted merkel to play " an important role " in future - a key measure of popularity .
at the peak of the government 's popularity in january , merkel was unequivocally the most popular politician in germany with 85 percent support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler is number one in the popularity stakes sunday 's score - seven percentage points less than in may - put merkel in second place in the popularity stakes behind president horst köhler , who remains widely appreciated with 74 percent . behind the chancellor in third place is social democrats ' leader , kurt beck , with 60 percent support , a drop of six points from may 's poll . the poll of about 1,000 people was conducted on july 25 and 26 .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?
the lack of response was deafening . " poor , poor baby , " the old lady must have thought .
" where is his mother ? " she knew exactly the type : those skinny ladies with too much makeup who seem to be surgically attached to their shopping bags .
those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .
in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .
we become resolute heroes despite the weather .
nothing can stop us . the gentle lady of koblenz - a law-abiding citizen par excellence - did what she thought was the only right thing to do when faced with an obvious case of negligence .
she could n't really go directly to her favorite tv judge , so she called the police .
she reported the incident and asked for prompt action .
a child was in desperate need for help . a different genre that was the point at which the afternoon court drama turned into an evening crime show , a " csi koblenz " of sorts .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?
the lack of response was deafening . " poor , poor baby , " the old lady must have thought .
" where is his mother ? " she knew exactly the type : those skinny ladies with too much makeup who seem to be surgically attached to their shopping bags .
those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .
in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?
the lack of response was deafening . " poor , poor baby , " the old lady must have thought .
" where is his mother ? " she knew exactly the type : those skinny ladies with too much makeup who seem to be surgically attached to their shopping bags .
those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .
in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .
we become resolute heroes despite the weather .
nothing can stop us . the gentle lady of koblenz - a law-abiding citizen par excellence - did what she thought was the only right thing to do when faced with an obvious case of negligence .
she could n't really go directly to her favorite tv judge , so she called the police .
she reported the incident and asked for prompt action .
a child was in desperate need for help . a different genre that was the point at which the afternoon court drama turned into an evening crime show , a " csi koblenz " of sorts .
the police arrived in no time , set up the perimeter , investigated the scene , developed a profile and came to a shocking conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous german nursery rhyme starts with " eins , zwei , polizei , drei , vier , offizier " there was no crime scene .
no clues were uncovered .
not a single suspect was apprehended .
in fact , not even a single victim was found . " foul play , " some people would say .
" the police officer in charge is a crook ! " but that would be jumping for conclusions .
the koblenz police reported on monday that nobody was apprehended because the screaming child turned out to be , in fact , a 25-year-old talking parrot . sprechen sie deutsch ? the parrot - who got a little raucous while showing off his latest linguistic trick - could have been charged with disturbing public peace , but that would have sent a wrong message to all the foreigners considering enrolling in a german language course at the goethe institute .
nobody should be discouraged from learning the slightly-larger-than-life language of schiller and heine , even parrots . we should keep in mind that learning a foreign language is not easy if you come from a species whose idea of a kiss is synonymous with a sharp bite .
parrots have tongues and vocal chords that let them sing better than most german teenage pop stars .
but they are no angelina jolie : they have no lips .
which means that bilabial sounds such as " m " and " b " are close to impossible for them to articulate properly , making a parrot 's cry of " mama " even more impressive . not to mention that nobody should get arrested for trying to overcome the big linguistic divide .
even on a sizzling hot summer day when there 's not much else to do . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from expensive , second-hand chewing gum to strange ferrari auctions , from friendly berliners to the other tennis player named b. becker , from exotic " summer hole " stars to wheelchair cons , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
the crux of honoring a hoax the german town of grevenbroich is in the midst of a serious political controversy involving its mayor , a star journalist , a family therapist , a folk singer and , believe it or not , queen beatrix of the netherlands .

he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all .

of the victims , some 37 were children .
the european press reacted harshly monday to the deadly offensive . the bombing of qana " fatally reminds us of the 102 civilians who were killed by israeli grenades in a unifil -lrb- united nations interim force in lebanon -rrb- camp in 1996 in the very same place , " wrote germany 's die tageszeitu n g .
israel 's rhetoric and the reaction of the international community are the same as they were 10 years ago , according to the paper .
an immediate , unconditional ceasefire would mean victory for hezbollah .
" without hasty military success , qana 2006 could become for the israeli army what qana 1996 became : the writing on the wall that preceded its withdrawal from lebanon . " " this bloodbath is only creating more hate , more terrorism , " wrote belgium 's le soir .
" if it continues like this , all the lebanese people will soon find themselves under the banner of the hezbollah . "
the events in qana could repeat themselves , continued the paper , and perhaps hezbollah will manage to bomb tel aviv .
" and then what response would it take to even up the score ?
let us stop here .
please , stop ! " " the blood from qana has splattered on everyone 's face , " wrote la repubblica in italy .
" it 's the blood of the innocent , " which has revealed the raw horror of this conflict , " and wo n't be easy to wipe it off . "
lebanon is a country that is harboring an " untamed guerilla , " continued the paper , but which is also " practically the only democratic society in the arab world .
blood has rained down on all those who are responsible for it : the direct and indirect protagonists , but also the powerful and powerless by-standers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 civilians were killed in israel 's 1996 attack on qana " the events in lebanon not only show that there is no longer a real anti-terror coalition in today 's world .
as paradoxical as it may sound , there is n't a war against terrorism either , " wrote russia 's kommersa n t .
" if , in a war like that in lebanon , which is conducted with the most modern and accurate weapons , 10 times as many children are killed as armed men , it can no longer be called a war against terrorism . " " moral justification for the use of violence is demanded of democracies , " wrote the dutch newspaper de volkskra n t , " or else the violence can be turned back on the perpetrators , which now seems to be the case . "
it would not be wise for israel to cultivate a camp mentality and hide behind its own moral correctness , according to the paper .
instead , " israel has to make use of the moment to critically examine its conduct and ask itself whether the disadvantages are gradually starting to outweigh the advantages . "
the us should insist on this , continued the paper .
" qana should be a turning point after three weeks of war , and the casualties there should be the last .

"
thousands of un troops , including german soldiers , protected election observers . the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- began its long wait monday for results from the weekend 's historic multi-party elections likely to see incumbent president joseph kabila win a mandate to lead the embattled central african country . the german albrecht conze , united nations deputy chief of political affairs and head of the un mission in congo , said sunday was " a day of rejoicing " for the congolese . he also said initial estimates show that voter participation was high and that un soldiers there to keep the peace were not forced to intervene .
german bundeswehr lieutenant colonel peter fuss said from congo 's capital kinshasa that - through its presence - " the bundeswehr contributed to the quiet and peaceful elections . " sunday 's election saw the start of the four-month mandate of 2,000 european union soldiers , 780 of whom are germans , in congo .
the bundeswehr has 280 soldiers are stationed directly in kinshasa while the other 500 are in neighboring gabon .

they said it was their only hope to finally end fighting and more than 40 years of misrule . they could choose from 33 different presidential candidates and hundreds of hopefuls on the parliamentary list . ballot counting began immediately after the 50,000 polling stations across the country closed sunday evening .
the results of the presidential race are expected on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.07.2006 european press review : creating more hate , more terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european newspapers hope the qana attack will be a turning point in the war israel bombed the lebanese village of qana sunday , killing an estimated 56 people .
of the victims , some 37 were children .
the european press reacted harshly monday to the deadly offensive . the bombing of qana " fatally reminds us of the 102 civilians who were killed by israeli grenades in a unifil -lrb- united nations interim force in lebanon -rrb- camp in 1996 in the very same place , " wrote germany 's die tageszeitu n g .
israel 's rhetoric and the reaction of the international community are the same as they were 10 years ago , according to the paper .
an immediate , unconditional ceasefire would mean victory for hezbollah .
" without hasty military success , qana 2006 could become for the israeli army what qana 1996 became : the writing on the wall that preceded its withdrawal from lebanon . " " this bloodbath is only creating more hate , more terrorism , " wrote belgium 's le soir .
" if it continues like this , all the lebanese people will soon find themselves under the banner of the hezbollah . "
the events in qana could repeat themselves , continued the paper , and perhaps hezbollah will manage to bomb tel aviv .
" and then what response would it take to even up the score ?
let us stop here .
please , stop ! " " the blood from qana has splattered on everyone 's face , " wrote la repubblica in italy .
" it 's the blood of the innocent , " which has revealed the raw horror of this conflict , " and wo n't be easy to wipe it off . "
lebanon is a country that is harboring an " untamed guerilla , " continued the paper , but which is also " practically the only democratic society in the arab world .
blood has rained down on all those who are responsible for it : the direct and indirect protagonists , but also the powerful and powerless by-standers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 civilians were killed in israel 's 1996 attack on qana " the events in lebanon not only show that there is no longer a real anti-terror coalition in today 's world .
as paradoxical as it may sound , there is n't a war against terrorism either , " wrote russia 's kommersa n t .
" if , in a war like that in lebanon , which is conducted with the most modern and accurate weapons , 10 times as many children are killed as armed men , it can no longer be called a war against terrorism . " " moral justification for the use of violence is demanded of democracies , " wrote the dutch newspaper de volkskra n t , " or else the violence can be turned back on the perpetrators , which now seems to be the case . "
it would not be wise for israel to cultivate a camp mentality and hide behind its own moral correctness , according to the paper .
instead , " israel has to make use of the moment to critically examine its conduct and ask itself whether the disadvantages are gradually starting to outweigh the advantages . "
the us should insist on this , continued the paper .
" qana should be a turning point after three weeks of war , and the casualties there should be the last .

that means higher turnover in the tourism industry , experts say . germany has been the most popular destination for vacationing germans in the past few years .
record temperatures and endless blue skies make the country even more attractive for nationals seeking relaxation . " germany is profiting from the hot summer , " sibylle zeuch , spokeswoman for the german travel association , which represents 5,000 different travel agencies and organizers , told the netzeitu n g . zeuch added that in the past few years , about one third of the trips that germans took lasting longer than five days were spent inland . " this trend will see a significant increase this year with the hot summer we 've been having , " she said . " germa n y has ma n y special attractio n s " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the beach is my castle " thilo braune , president of the german tourism association , said many regions in germany have not exhausted their capacity . " germany has so much to offer , " he said .
" there are special attractions everywhere , but often they are not marketed well enough . " high marketing costs are prohibitive and regional web sites are still inadequate , he added . claudia gilles , managing director of the german travel association , told netzeitu n g that the seaside is a magnet for germans vacationing in their home country . " campgrounds on the north and baltic seas are packed right now , " she said . she also expects the beautiful weather to have a positive effect on germany 's tourism economy .
however , precise figures on the number of booked overnight stays within the country will not be reported until october . " the baltic sea may replace the mediterra n ea n as a vacatio n spot " theo eberhard , a professor of tourism at the university of applied sciences in munich , expects the trend to increase .
since global warming is likely to continue causing heat waves in central europe , he said , eastern europe is becoming an attractive destination for traveling germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's beaches could soon get a run for their money " germans follow the sun , " he said .
" but if the sun gets too hot for them , they avoid the south and head east . " once germans start feeling the baltic climate to be more pleasant than that of the mediterranean , the demand for vacations in baltic countries will grow , he added . people from all over europe may also start following the trend , he added . " but we 'll just have to wait and see what happens , " he said .
" tourism is like a traveling circus .
it changes all the time .
people 's travel habits change as quickly as consumer behavior does .

" what we expect is an immediate cease-fire and the application of what was demanded ... that is the setting up of humanitarian corridors , " one eu diplomat said on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks . " almost all the europeans want a truce or a cease-fire . " britain joins us in calling for un force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops in lebanon would be given peacekeeping powers britain , with its close ally the united states , has pushed instead for agreement at the united nations to deploy an international force to secure the israel-lebanon border and ensure that any cease-fire is sustainable . but finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu presidency , said in helsinki that agreement including britain was possible . " i expect the eu to be able to act with consensus including great britain , " he told journalists .
" there have also been discussions with the british prime minister , " he said . france for its part is seeking to seize the diplomatic initiative . foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said monday that a " cease-fire is a priority and an urgent request .
we need an immediate cease-fire and an end to the -lrb- israeli -rrb- blockade . " an eu official noted : " there are always different sensitivities among member states , but this is something we have to live with and try to be as effective as possible . " tuesday 's meeting comes after israel announced the suspension of air strikes for 48 hours after its war planes killed 52 civilians , about 30 of them children according to police , in the lebanese village of qana .
the eu has condemned the attack . in all , the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon since israel launched its air , sea and land assault after hezbollah seized two of its soldiers on july 12 . hezbollah fighters meanwhile have fired between 1,700 and 1,900 rockets at northern israel , killing some 18 civilians and wounding more than 300 people . cease-fire and aid to be discussed a german government spokesman said monday that the pause in air strikes - called to investigate the qana killings - is " a positive sign " that a lasting cease-fire could be within reach . during their talks , the ministers will be briefed by external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who just returned from a trip to the region , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has agreed safe passage for food and medicine aid efforts will also figure high on the agenda , following the european commission 's announcement last week of a further 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to help the victims . " we would like to see the new member states committing more humanitarian aid .
i think they will do , because there is a lot of pressure from public opinion , " said amadeu altafaj , spokesman on eu aid issues . as an aid provider , the bloc has influence with lebanon and the palestinians - also up for discussion tuesday - but it holds little sway with israel and is reluctant to compromise what small leverage it has . the foreign ministers are not expected to draw up formal conclusions but want to show that the eu " remains active " on the crisis and that its members are " in phase , " another eu diplomat said . " it 's obvious that we have to move very quickly now .
what the european union can do additionally in political terms is to keep pressure on the timetable ... add a sense of urgency , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

" what we expect is an immediate cease-fire and the application of what was demanded ... that is the setting up of humanitarian corridors , " one eu diplomat said on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks . " almost all the europeans want a truce or a cease-fire . " britain joins us in calling for un force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops in lebanon would be given peacekeeping powers britain , with its close ally the united states , has pushed instead for agreement at the united nations to deploy an international force to secure the israel-lebanon border and ensure that any cease-fire is sustainable . but finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu presidency , said in helsinki that agreement including britain was possible . " i expect the eu to be able to act with consensus including great britain , " he told journalists .
" there have also been discussions with the british prime minister , " he said . france for its part is seeking to seize the diplomatic initiative . foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said monday that a " cease-fire is a priority and an urgent request .
we need an immediate cease-fire and an end to the -lrb- israeli -rrb- blockade . " an eu official noted : " there are always different sensitivities among member states , but this is something we have to live with and try to be as effective as possible . " tuesday 's meeting comes after israel announced the suspension of air strikes for 48 hours after its war planes killed 52 civilians , about 30 of them children according to police , in the lebanese village of qana .
the eu has condemned the attack . in all , the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon since israel launched its air , sea and land assault after hezbollah seized two of its soldiers on july 12 . hezbollah fighters meanwhile have fired between 1,700 and 1,900 rockets at northern israel , killing some 18 civilians and wounding more than 300 people . cease-fire and aid to be discussed a german government spokesman said monday that the pause in air strikes - called to investigate the qana killings - is " a positive sign " that a lasting cease-fire could be within reach . during their talks , the ministers will be briefed by external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who just returned from a trip to the region , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has agreed safe passage for food and medicine aid efforts will also figure high on the agenda , following the european commission 's announcement last week of a further 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to help the victims . " we would like to see the new member states committing more humanitarian aid .
i think they will do , because there is a lot of pressure from public opinion , " said amadeu altafaj , spokesman on eu aid issues . as an aid provider , the bloc has influence with lebanon and the palestinians - also up for discussion tuesday - but it holds little sway with israel and is reluctant to compromise what small leverage it has . the foreign ministers are not expected to draw up formal conclusions but want to show that the eu " remains active " on the crisis and that its members are " in phase , " another eu diplomat said . " it 's obvious that we have to move very quickly now .
what the european union can do additionally in political terms is to keep pressure on the timetable ... add a sense of urgency , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .

that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .

everything went dark and we just heard screaming . we were all injured .
my son almost lost his leg and still has stones and rocket shrapnel in his head .
my daughter is suffering from many injuries and has had to undergo several operations , just as my wife has .
my sister-in-law 's brother lost both of his legs and his two-year-old daughter lost a finger . who rescued you ? after two hours of intense pain and bleeding , the people in the village heard our cries for help and called the red cross .
the red cross ambulance evacuated me , the sister-in-law 's brother and another child because we were the most seriously injured .

i began to reach out and touch the people next to me , so i could recognize them .
my sister did the same thing . afterwards , i pushed my daughter toward the door so she could have a little light to see by .
despite my injuries , i never gave up .
i kept looking for my husband and son .
in the rubble and darkness i heard my 14-year-old son screaming " mamma , mamma , i ca n't move ! "

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children .

" what we expect is an immediate cease-fire and the application of what was demanded ... that is the setting up of humanitarian corridors , " one eu diplomat said on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks . " almost all the europeans want a truce or a cease-fire . " britain joins us in calling for un force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops in lebanon would be given peacekeeping powers britain , with its close ally the united states , has pushed instead for agreement at the united nations to deploy an international force to secure the israel-lebanon border and ensure that any cease-fire is sustainable . but finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu presidency , said in helsinki that agreement including britain was possible . " i expect the eu to be able to act with consensus including great britain , " he told journalists .
" there have also been discussions with the british prime minister , " he said . france for its part is seeking to seize the diplomatic initiative . foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said monday that a " cease-fire is a priority and an urgent request .
we need an immediate cease-fire and an end to the -lrb- israeli -rrb- blockade . " an eu official noted : " there are always different sensitivities among member states , but this is something we have to live with and try to be as effective as possible . " tuesday 's meeting comes after israel announced the suspension of air strikes for 48 hours after its war planes killed 52 civilians , about 30 of them children according to police , in the lebanese village of qana .
the eu has condemned the attack . in all , the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon since israel launched its air , sea and land assault after hezbollah seized two of its soldiers on july 12 . hezbollah fighters meanwhile have fired between 1,700 and 1,900 rockets at northern israel , killing some 18 civilians and wounding more than 300 people . cease-fire and aid to be discussed a german government spokesman said monday that the pause in air strikes - called to investigate the qana killings - is " a positive sign " that a lasting cease-fire could be within reach . during their talks , the ministers will be briefed by external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who just returned from a trip to the region , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has agreed safe passage for food and medicine aid efforts will also figure high on the agenda , following the european commission 's announcement last week of a further 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to help the victims . " we would like to see the new member states committing more humanitarian aid .
i think they will do , because there is a lot of pressure from public opinion , " said amadeu altafaj , spokesman on eu aid issues . as an aid provider , the bloc has influence with lebanon and the palestinians - also up for discussion tuesday - but it holds little sway with israel and is reluctant to compromise what small leverage it has . the foreign ministers are not expected to draw up formal conclusions but want to show that the eu " remains active " on the crisis and that its members are " in phase , " another eu diplomat said . " it 's obvious that we have to move very quickly now .
what the european union can do additionally in political terms is to keep pressure on the timetable ... add a sense of urgency , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

my sister-in-law 's brother lost both of his legs and his two-year-old daughter lost a finger . who rescued you ? after two hours of intense pain and bleeding , the people in the village heard our cries for help and called the red cross .
the red cross ambulance evacuated me , the sister-in-law 's brother and another child because we were the most seriously injured .

in beirut we had to wait for two days until they took us to the beirut harbor , where a british military helicopter was waiting to get us to cyprus .
with a " yellow angel , " one of the rescue jets belonging to adac -lrb- german automobile association -rrb- , we were flown to dortmund . ms. fatima ibrahim , can you describe your feelings when you saw that your village was being bombed ? we were always waiting for the next rocket down there in the bunker .
and suddenly everything went dark and we did n't know if we were alive or dead .
i heard the others screaming , which actually calmed me down somewhat , because it meant that some of us were still alive .
i began to reach out and touch the people next to me , so i could recognize them .
my sister did the same thing . afterwards , i pushed my daughter toward the door so she could have a little light to see by .
despite my injuries , i never gave up .
i kept looking for my husband and son .
in the rubble and darkness i heard my 14-year-old son screaming " mamma , mamma , i ca n't move ! "
he is as big as me and i tried to bring him out of there .
then i saw that he had almost lost his leg .
i carried him outside and started screaming for help .

" i expect the eu to be able to act with consensus including great britain , " he told journalists .
" there have also been discussions with the british prime minister , " he said . france for its part is seeking to seize the diplomatic initiative . foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said monday that a " cease-fire is a priority and an urgent request .
we need an immediate cease-fire and an end to the -lrb- israeli -rrb- blockade . " an eu official noted : " there are always different sensitivities among member states , but this is something we have to live with and try to be as effective as possible . " tuesday 's meeting comes after israel announced the suspension of air strikes for 48 hours after its war planes killed 52 civilians , about 30 of them children according to police , in the lebanese village of qana .
the eu has condemned the attack . in all , the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon since israel launched its air , sea and land assault after hezbollah seized two of its soldiers on july 12 . hezbollah fighters meanwhile have fired between 1,700 and 1,900 rockets at northern israel , killing some 18 civilians and wounding more than 300 people . cease-fire and aid to be discussed a german government spokesman said monday that the pause in air strikes - called to investigate the qana killings - is " a positive sign " that a lasting cease-fire could be within reach . during their talks , the ministers will be briefed by external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who just returned from a trip to the region , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has agreed safe passage for food and medicine aid efforts will also figure high on the agenda , following the european commission 's announcement last week of a further 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to help the victims . " we would like to see the new member states committing more humanitarian aid .
i think they will do , because there is a lot of pressure from public opinion , " said amadeu altafaj , spokesman on eu aid issues . as an aid provider , the bloc has influence with lebanon and the palestinians - also up for discussion tuesday - but it holds little sway with israel and is reluctant to compromise what small leverage it has . the foreign ministers are not expected to draw up formal conclusions but want to show that the eu " remains active " on the crisis and that its members are " in phase , " another eu diplomat said . " it 's obvious that we have to move very quickly now .

that means higher turnover in the tourism industry , experts say . germany has been the most popular destination for vacationing germans in the past few years .
record temperatures and endless blue skies make the country even more attractive for nationals seeking relaxation . " germany is profiting from the hot summer , " sibylle zeuch , spokeswoman for the german travel association , which represents 5,000 different travel agencies and organizers , told the netzeitu n g . zeuch added that in the past few years , about one third of the trips that germans took lasting longer than five days were spent inland . " this trend will see a significant increase this year with the hot summer we 've been having , " she said . " germa n y has ma n y special attractio n s " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the beach is my castle " thilo braune , president of the german tourism association , said many regions in germany have not exhausted their capacity . " germany has so much to offer , " he said .
" there are special attractions everywhere , but often they are not marketed well enough . " high marketing costs are prohibitive and regional web sites are still inadequate , he added . claudia gilles , managing director of the german travel association , told netzeitu n g that the seaside is a magnet for germans vacationing in their home country . " campgrounds on the north and baltic seas are packed right now , " she said . she also expects the beautiful weather to have a positive effect on germany 's tourism economy .
however , precise figures on the number of booked overnight stays within the country will not be reported until october . " the baltic sea may replace the mediterra n ea n as a vacatio n spot " theo eberhard , a professor of tourism at the university of applied sciences in munich , expects the trend to increase .

of the victims , some 37 were children .
the european press reacted harshly monday to the deadly offensive . the bombing of qana " fatally reminds us of the 102 civilians who were killed by israeli grenades in a unifil -lrb- united nations interim force in lebanon -rrb- camp in 1996 in the very same place , " wrote germany 's die tageszeitu n g .
israel 's rhetoric and the reaction of the international community are the same as they were 10 years ago , according to the paper .
an immediate , unconditional ceasefire would mean victory for hezbollah .
" without hasty military success , qana 2006 could become for the israeli army what qana 1996 became : the writing on the wall that preceded its withdrawal from lebanon . " " this bloodbath is only creating more hate , more terrorism , " wrote belgium 's le soir .
" if it continues like this , all the lebanese people will soon find themselves under the banner of the hezbollah . "
the events in qana could repeat themselves , continued the paper , and perhaps hezbollah will manage to bomb tel aviv .
" and then what response would it take to even up the score ?
let us stop here .
please , stop ! " " the blood from qana has splattered on everyone 's face , " wrote la repubblica in italy .
" it 's the blood of the innocent , " which has revealed the raw horror of this conflict , " and wo n't be easy to wipe it off . "
lebanon is a country that is harboring an " untamed guerilla , " continued the paper , but which is also " practically the only democratic society in the arab world .
blood has rained down on all those who are responsible for it : the direct and indirect protagonists , but also the powerful and powerless by-standers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 civilians were killed in israel 's 1996 attack on qana " the events in lebanon not only show that there is no longer a real anti-terror coalition in today 's world .
as paradoxical as it may sound , there is n't a war against terrorism either , " wrote russia 's kommersa n t .
" if , in a war like that in lebanon , which is conducted with the most modern and accurate weapons , 10 times as many children are killed as armed men , it can no longer be called a war against terrorism . " " moral justification for the use of violence is demanded of democracies , " wrote the dutch newspaper de volkskra n t , " or else the violence can be turned back on the perpetrators , which now seems to be the case . "
it would not be wise for israel to cultivate a camp mentality and hide behind its own moral correctness , according to the paper .
instead , " israel has to make use of the moment to critically examine its conduct and ask itself whether the disadvantages are gradually starting to outweigh the advantages . "
the us should insist on this , continued the paper .
" qana should be a turning point after three weeks of war , and the casualties there should be the last .

of the victims , some 37 were children .
the european press reacted harshly monday to the deadly offensive . the bombing of qana " fatally reminds us of the 102 civilians who were killed by israeli grenades in a unifil -lrb- united nations interim force in lebanon -rrb- camp in 1996 in the very same place , " wrote germany 's die tageszeitu n g .
israel 's rhetoric and the reaction of the international community are the same as they were 10 years ago , according to the paper .
an immediate , unconditional ceasefire would mean victory for hezbollah .
" without hasty military success , qana 2006 could become for the israeli army what qana 1996 became : the writing on the wall that preceded its withdrawal from lebanon . " " this bloodbath is only creating more hate , more terrorism , " wrote belgium 's le soir .
" if it continues like this , all the lebanese people will soon find themselves under the banner of the hezbollah . "
the events in qana could repeat themselves , continued the paper , and perhaps hezbollah will manage to bomb tel aviv .
" and then what response would it take to even up the score ?
let us stop here .
please , stop ! " " the blood from qana has splattered on everyone 's face , " wrote la repubblica in italy .
" it 's the blood of the innocent , " which has revealed the raw horror of this conflict , " and wo n't be easy to wipe it off . "
lebanon is a country that is harboring an " untamed guerilla , " continued the paper , but which is also " practically the only democratic society in the arab world .
blood has rained down on all those who are responsible for it : the direct and indirect protagonists , but also the powerful and powerless by-standers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 civilians were killed in israel 's 1996 attack on qana " the events in lebanon not only show that there is no longer a real anti-terror coalition in today 's world .
as paradoxical as it may sound , there is n't a war against terrorism either , " wrote russia 's kommersa n t .
" if , in a war like that in lebanon , which is conducted with the most modern and accurate weapons , 10 times as many children are killed as armed men , it can no longer be called a war against terrorism . " " moral justification for the use of violence is demanded of democracies , " wrote the dutch newspaper de volkskra n t , " or else the violence can be turned back on the perpetrators , which now seems to be the case . "
it would not be wise for israel to cultivate a camp mentality and hide behind its own moral correctness , according to the paper .
instead , " israel has to make use of the moment to critically examine its conduct and ask itself whether the disadvantages are gradually starting to outweigh the advantages . "
the us should insist on this , continued the paper .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?

those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building was a ruin after wwii they come in all weather and wait patiently at the entrance - visitors from both germany and abroad - for whom a berlin trip without a visit to the reichstag would feel incomplete . since about seven years ago , around 10,000 people visit daily .
that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .
inside , a mirror-clad funnel illuminates the assembly hall .
and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" he had with his concept created the perfect synthesis between modern architecture and the building 's historical roots .
it mirrors the history of this building and its present and future through its design . " arriving in the present thierse , formerly president of the bundestag , was there that day in april 1999 , when the first meeting of the parliament opened in the rebuilt reichstag .
it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .
" this contrast between the old and the new is so well connected .
i think the architecture is very successful and representing the future of the building , and its past .

where to go , what to do ?
the soul-searching leads to one possibility : attending a church along germany 's famed autobahn . one autobahn chapel on the a6 route between nuremburg and prague hosts a series of events under the title " salvation and the exhilaration of speed . "
there , near the border to the czech republic , church organist and music therapist bernd ebener sings gregorian chants . often on the road alone , he said stopping off and singing in an autobahn chapel is relaxing after a long stretch of driving . " going to a church along a motorway of course says a lot about the fast pace of our society , " ebener said .
" i figured i would try it out .
taking a break from the stress of daily life is important .
what better way to do it than halting at a space designed for spirituality ?

" people are looking more and more for places of refuge . " each autobahn chapel has a " book of concerns . "
it is kind of like a guestbook in which visitors can write down their thoughts , wishes or concerns . sometimes people even write down a note of thanks , said pastor peter klamt of the himmelkron autobahn church in bavaria . the pastor often creates special services for his church , like the " siren service " in november for fire fighters , police and medical personnel . and , three times a year - including july 30 , which is " autobahn church day " - pastor klamt blesses the cars and trucks that roll up in front of his motorway chapel . michael hollenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism .

" what we expect is an immediate cease-fire and the application of what was demanded ... that is the setting up of humanitarian corridors , " one eu diplomat said on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks . " almost all the europeans want a truce or a cease-fire . " britain joins us in calling for un force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops in lebanon would be given peacekeeping powers britain , with its close ally the united states , has pushed instead for agreement at the united nations to deploy an international force to secure the israel-lebanon border and ensure that any cease-fire is sustainable . but finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu presidency , said in helsinki that agreement including britain was possible . " i expect the eu to be able to act with consensus including great britain , " he told journalists .
" there have also been discussions with the british prime minister , " he said . france for its part is seeking to seize the diplomatic initiative . foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said monday that a " cease-fire is a priority and an urgent request .
we need an immediate cease-fire and an end to the -lrb- israeli -rrb- blockade . " an eu official noted : " there are always different sensitivities among member states , but this is something we have to live with and try to be as effective as possible . " tuesday 's meeting comes after israel announced the suspension of air strikes for 48 hours after its war planes killed 52 civilians , about 30 of them children according to police , in the lebanese village of qana .
the eu has condemned the attack . in all , the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon since israel launched its air , sea and land assault after hezbollah seized two of its soldiers on july 12 . hezbollah fighters meanwhile have fired between 1,700 and 1,900 rockets at northern israel , killing some 18 civilians and wounding more than 300 people . cease-fire and aid to be discussed a german government spokesman said monday that the pause in air strikes - called to investigate the qana killings - is " a positive sign " that a lasting cease-fire could be within reach . during their talks , the ministers will be briefed by external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who just returned from a trip to the region , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has agreed safe passage for food and medicine aid efforts will also figure high on the agenda , following the european commission 's announcement last week of a further 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to help the victims . " we would like to see the new member states committing more humanitarian aid .
i think they will do , because there is a lot of pressure from public opinion , " said amadeu altafaj , spokesman on eu aid issues . as an aid provider , the bloc has influence with lebanon and the palestinians - also up for discussion tuesday - but it holds little sway with israel and is reluctant to compromise what small leverage it has . the foreign ministers are not expected to draw up formal conclusions but want to show that the eu " remains active " on the crisis and that its members are " in phase , " another eu diplomat said . " it 's obvious that we have to move very quickly now .
what the european union can do additionally in political terms is to keep pressure on the timetable ... add a sense of urgency , " the diplomat said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

not only is the german government considering banning smoking in public places but now the chancellor has thrown her weight behind the ban that would end germany 's status as a haven for smokers and bring it into line with several other european countries . in an interview published in the weekend tabloid bild am so n n tag , angela merkel said that she supported the recent calls for a ban on smoking in public buildings led by consumer affairs minister horst seehofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-smoker merkel wants to protect non-smokers " i always argue for a sense of proportion with such bans , but i find the demand for a general smoking ban in public buildings legitimate , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , adding that she expected a decision on " better protection for non-smokers " to be taken some time this year with an implementation penciled in for 2007 . " i see in neighboring countries that freedom does not go under when tough rules are drawn up to protect non-smokers , " merkel , who said she used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day before quitting , was quoted as saying . earlier this month , seehofer said he hoped that a ban would be in place in germany by 2007 and that the issue would be put on parliament 's agenda when it reconvenes after the summer recess . seehofer added that he thought it unacceptable that people could just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " germa n y smokes alo n e - almost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eu countries have made it clear where they stand public smoking bans are in place in ireland , italy , the netherlands among others and germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants . the power to enforce bans in germany currently lies in the hands of the individual state governments who can decide whether schools , universities , hospitals or city offices should be smoke-free . the decision to ban smoking in restaurants , bars and clubs is left up to the owners of such establishments . according to the german hotel and restaurant association , so far only about 30 percent of german restaurants offer non-smoking zones . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister wants public smoking ban in 2007 germany 's minister for consumer affairs has said he expects a ban on smoking in public places to take effect sometime in 2007 .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?

those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .

the koblenz police reported on monday that nobody was apprehended because the screaming child turned out to be , in fact , a 25-year-old talking parrot . sprechen sie deutsch ? the parrot - who got a little raucous while showing off his latest linguistic trick - could have been charged with disturbing public peace , but that would have sent a wrong message to all the foreigners considering enrolling in a german language course at the goethe institute .

but they are no angelina jolie : they have no lips .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?
the lack of response was deafening . " poor , poor baby , " the old lady must have thought .
" where is his mother ? " she knew exactly the type : those skinny ladies with too much makeup who seem to be surgically attached to their shopping bags .
those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .
in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .
we become resolute heroes despite the weather .
nothing can stop us . the gentle lady of koblenz - a law-abiding citizen par excellence - did what she thought was the only right thing to do when faced with an obvious case of negligence .
she could n't really go directly to her favorite tv judge , so she called the police .
she reported the incident and asked for prompt action .
a child was in desperate need for help . a different genre that was the point at which the afternoon court drama turned into an evening crime show , a " csi koblenz " of sorts .
the police arrived in no time , set up the perimeter , investigated the scene , developed a profile and came to a shocking conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous german nursery rhyme starts with " eins , zwei , polizei , drei , vier , offizier " there was no crime scene .
no clues were uncovered .
not a single suspect was apprehended .
in fact , not even a single victim was found . " foul play , " some people would say .
" the police officer in charge is a crook ! " but that would be jumping for conclusions .
the koblenz police reported on monday that nobody was apprehended because the screaming child turned out to be , in fact , a 25-year-old talking parrot . sprechen sie deutsch ? the parrot - who got a little raucous while showing off his latest linguistic trick - could have been charged with disturbing public peace , but that would have sent a wrong message to all the foreigners considering enrolling in a german language course at the goethe institute .
nobody should be discouraged from learning the slightly-larger-than-life language of schiller and heine , even parrots . we should keep in mind that learning a foreign language is not easy if you come from a species whose idea of a kiss is synonymous with a sharp bite .
parrots have tongues and vocal chords that let them sing better than most german teenage pop stars .
but they are no angelina jolie : they have no lips .
which means that bilabial sounds such as " m " and " b " are close to impossible for them to articulate properly , making a parrot 's cry of " mama " even more impressive . not to mention that nobody should get arrested for trying to overcome the big linguistic divide .

of the victims , some 37 were children .
the european press reacted harshly monday to the deadly offensive . the bombing of qana " fatally reminds us of the 102 civilians who were killed by israeli grenades in a unifil -lrb- united nations interim force in lebanon -rrb- camp in 1996 in the very same place , " wrote germany 's die tageszeitu n g .
israel 's rhetoric and the reaction of the international community are the same as they were 10 years ago , according to the paper .
an immediate , unconditional ceasefire would mean victory for hezbollah .
" without hasty military success , qana 2006 could become for the israeli army what qana 1996 became : the writing on the wall that preceded its withdrawal from lebanon . " " this bloodbath is only creating more hate , more terrorism , " wrote belgium 's le soir .
" if it continues like this , all the lebanese people will soon find themselves under the banner of the hezbollah . "
the events in qana could repeat themselves , continued the paper , and perhaps hezbollah will manage to bomb tel aviv .
" and then what response would it take to even up the score ?
let us stop here .
please , stop ! " " the blood from qana has splattered on everyone 's face , " wrote la repubblica in italy .
" it 's the blood of the innocent , " which has revealed the raw horror of this conflict , " and wo n't be easy to wipe it off . "
lebanon is a country that is harboring an " untamed guerilla , " continued the paper , but which is also " practically the only democratic society in the arab world .
blood has rained down on all those who are responsible for it : the direct and indirect protagonists , but also the powerful and powerless by-standers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 civilians were killed in israel 's 1996 attack on qana " the events in lebanon not only show that there is no longer a real anti-terror coalition in today 's world .
as paradoxical as it may sound , there is n't a war against terrorism either , " wrote russia 's kommersa n t .
" if , in a war like that in lebanon , which is conducted with the most modern and accurate weapons , 10 times as many children are killed as armed men , it can no longer be called a war against terrorism . " " moral justification for the use of violence is demanded of democracies , " wrote the dutch newspaper de volkskra n t , " or else the violence can be turned back on the perpetrators , which now seems to be the case . "
it would not be wise for israel to cultivate a camp mentality and hide behind its own moral correctness , according to the paper .
instead , " israel has to make use of the moment to critically examine its conduct and ask itself whether the disadvantages are gradually starting to outweigh the advantages . "
the us should insist on this , continued the paper .
" qana should be a turning point after three weeks of war , and the casualties there should be the last .

" the suspension of our aerial activities does not signify in any way the end to the war , " ramon told israeli army radio . " on the contrary , this decision will allow us to win this war and lessen international pressure . " to stop the war at this stage would mean a victory for hezbollah and for international terrorism , manipulated by iran and syria , " added ramon , who is considered close to prime minister ehud olmert and is a member of the nation 's security cabinet . another cabinet member considered close to olmert , minister of immigrant absorption zeev boim , told public radio that the suspension in aerial attacks was " temporary and limited . " " we took this decision to take into account the interests of the united states , our loyal and courageous ally that finds itself in a difficult position because of its support of israel , " boim said . boim added the halt in air attacks would not apply " if we see attempts by the hezbollah to restock itself with arms and rockets from syria . " hassan fadlallah , a hezbollah member of parliament , said a limited suspension of israeli air strikes into lebanon was not enough to halt the conflict with the shiite muslim group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel will continue its ground offensive " the war will end when israel stops its aggression comprehensively and totally and pulls out from the points -lrb- its ground forces -rrb- entered in south lebanon , " fadlallah told reuters . " if the aim of israel 's decision to suspend air raids is to absorb the international outrage over the qana massacre and then proceed with ground bombardment , that means israel has not stopped its aggression , " fadlallah added . britain , germany welcome suspension british prime minister tony blair welcomed the temporary halt to the israeli bombardment of lebanon , saying he was optimistic of the chances of an end to hostilities . " what 's important now is that we have a real chance of getting a united nations security council resolution which will give us the opportunity both to have the complete cessation of hostilities , not merely a temporary one , but on a sustainable , lasting basis , " said blair . " what has happened to qana shows that this is a situation that simply can not continue , " he added .
" i 've been conducting a serious of urgent course negotiations with other leaders .
i 've also spoken to prime minister siniora of the lebanon .
i think there is a basis for an agreement that would allow us to get a un resolution . . hostilities have got to stop .
and stop on all sides . "
gernot erler , a german deputy foreign minister , said on germany 's zdf television that the suspension of air strikes was a sign that the united states was beginning to exert its influence with positive effects in the middle east crisis . " what -lrb- us secretary of state -rrb- condoleezza rice achieved in israel in the last few hours is far more than one could actually expect , and we also have the impression that great pressure is now being exercised by america , " erler said . " i think that , in america , there is an understanding of the danger to the standing of both israel and america that is linked with qana , with this tragedy , " he added . qa n a bombi n g leads to limited ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of civilians were killed in the war 's deadliest strike the announcement of the suspension of air strikes came after the un security council held an emergency meeting after israeli bombs struck a building in the southern lebanese village of qana , killing dozens of civilians , many of them children sunday 's strike , the deadliest yet , prompted rice to call for a un resolution that could bring about a complete halt to fighting . the bloodshed in qana , which israel said was accidental , has triggered outrage across the world and increased international pressure on the united states to back an immediate end to the fighting . rice believes full ceasefire i n sight after a long night of discussions in jerusalem , rice said a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah could be achieved this week .
world powers will meet again on monday to discuss the next possible developments in the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with israel 's prime minister ehud olmert rice said during her discussions with top israeli officials she had found consensus on several issues that she thinks could form the political basis for a solution to the crisis . but the statements from israel regarding the 48-hour air strike suspension suggested there was no indication from israeli politicians that they were actually willing to agree to an immediate and complete ceasefire . israel urged to stop the war international criticism is growing and many leaders have demanded more urgency from israel to stop the fighting . france , germany and several other western nations have also called for an immediate ceasefire in the region . meanwhile , israeli air strikes hit eastern lebanon early on monday , with two raids near the syrian border .
however , israel said the strikes had been carried out before the 48-hour suspension came into effect . when the members of the un security council meet this week , they will also discuss the establishment of an international stabilization force . the force would then be deployed as soon as possible after a un resolution and create a buffer zone between southern lebanon and israel . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we barely escaped death " a german-lebanese family from the town of lünen found themselves under israeli bombardment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2006 namibia 's german newspaper still a cultural icon at 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allgemeine zeitung and stefan fischer , its editor-in-chief this year , namibia 's oldest daily newspaper celebrates its 90th birthday .
since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .

since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .

that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .

and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building was a ruin after wwii they come in all weather and wait patiently at the entrance - visitors from both germany and abroad - for whom a berlin trip without a visit to the reichstag would feel incomplete . since about seven years ago , around 10,000 people visit daily .
that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .
inside , a mirror-clad funnel illuminates the assembly hall .
and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" he had with his concept created the perfect synthesis between modern architecture and the building 's historical roots .
it mirrors the history of this building and its present and future through its design . " arriving in the present thierse , formerly president of the bundestag , was there that day in april 1999 , when the first meeting of the parliament opened in the rebuilt reichstag .
it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .
" this contrast between the old and the new is so well connected .
i think the architecture is very successful and representing the future of the building , and its past .

since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .
" land reform , criminality , sometimes natural phenomena , like our rainy season .

i think it is our job to slowly but surely bring the readers up to the present time and say , ' hey , this is namibia today .
this is new !

because we see quite often that german speakers do n't really want to get involved and open up to the public .

these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building was a ruin after wwii they come in all weather and wait patiently at the entrance - visitors from both germany and abroad - for whom a berlin trip without a visit to the reichstag would feel incomplete . since about seven years ago , around 10,000 people visit daily .
that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .
inside , a mirror-clad funnel illuminates the assembly hall .
and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .

it mirrors the history of this building and its present and future through its design . " arriving in the present thierse , formerly president of the bundestag , was there that day in april 1999 , when the first meeting of the parliament opened in the rebuilt reichstag .
it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building was a ruin after wwii they come in all weather and wait patiently at the entrance - visitors from both germany and abroad - for whom a berlin trip without a visit to the reichstag would feel incomplete . since about seven years ago , around 10,000 people visit daily .
that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .
inside , a mirror-clad funnel illuminates the assembly hall .
and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" he had with his concept created the perfect synthesis between modern architecture and the building 's historical roots .
it mirrors the history of this building and its present and future through its design . " arriving in the present thierse , formerly president of the bundestag , was there that day in april 1999 , when the first meeting of the parliament opened in the rebuilt reichstag .
it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .

since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .
" land reform , criminality , sometimes natural phenomena , like our rainy season .
and , oh yeah , the budget , and the fight against corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmer martin wucher is one of namibia 's german speaking minority editor doro greve said she thinks it is very important to cover namibian topics and make an effort to get away from purely german news . " i sometimes think some of our readers are a little bit stuck in the 1980s .
i think it is our job to slowly but surely bring the readers up to the present time and say , ' hey , this is namibia today .
this is new !
and come along with us , stand up and be seen ! '
because we see quite often that german speakers do n't really want to get involved and open up to the public .
and i think if we can help a little , as a newspaper we have really accomplished something . " ' i know i have arrived ' one steady allgemeine zeitung reader is wolfgang , who has paid regular visits to namibia for the past 25 years .
for him , the az and namibia are inseparable . " for me , the az personifies namibia .
it 's like fish river canyon or the spitzkoppe -lrb- mountain -rrb- .
it is a cultural institution of this country , " he said .
" when i fly into -lrb- namibian capital -rrb- windhoek and drive into town and sit with a cool beer , and i have the az in my hand - then i know i have arrived .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building was a ruin after wwii they come in all weather and wait patiently at the entrance - visitors from both germany and abroad - for whom a berlin trip without a visit to the reichstag would feel incomplete . since about seven years ago , around 10,000 people visit daily .
that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .

" that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .

since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .
" land reform , criminality , sometimes natural phenomena , like our rainy season .
and , oh yeah , the budget , and the fight against corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmer martin wucher is one of namibia 's german speaking minority editor doro greve said she thinks it is very important to cover namibian topics and make an effort to get away from purely german news . " i sometimes think some of our readers are a little bit stuck in the 1980s .
i think it is our job to slowly but surely bring the readers up to the present time and say , ' hey , this is namibia today .
this is new !
and come along with us , stand up and be seen ! '
because we see quite often that german speakers do n't really want to get involved and open up to the public .
and i think if we can help a little , as a newspaper we have really accomplished something . " ' i know i have arrived ' one steady allgemeine zeitung reader is wolfgang , who has paid regular visits to namibia for the past 25 years .
for him , the az and namibia are inseparable . " for me , the az personifies namibia .
it 's like fish river canyon or the spitzkoppe -lrb- mountain -rrb- .
it is a cultural institution of this country , " he said .
" when i fly into -lrb- namibian capital -rrb- windhoek and drive into town and sit with a cool beer , and i have the az in my hand - then i know i have arrived .

since 1916 , the german-language " allgemeine zeitung " has been informing the country 's german speakers . " breakfast would n't be breakfast without the az , " said almute öl , who grew up with the allgemeine zeitung , africa 's one and only german-language daily . öl , who heads the german-language radio program in namibia , said she would hate to have to go without the az , as the paper is affectionately called .
" it 's the thing that ties together our country , " öl said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence street in downtown windhoek , the namibian capital " it also has a unique point of view that the other newspapers do n't have .
it tells a lot more about the german community .
we should be really proud to have a paper like this , in our own language .
i buy it every day . " the 12-to-16-page allgemeine zeitung costs three namibian dollars , around 35 euro cents .
it has been accused of focusing too much on german subjects and on the past .
but 36-year-old editor-in-chief stefan fischer , from cottbus , said he begs to differ . " the only thing that is german about the az is the language , " he said .
" we are n't a german newspaper in namibia , like a lot of astonished tourists think when they first come here .
we are a namibian paper written in the german language . " particular language actually it is written in " southwest german , " the language spoken by german-speakers in namibia , explains former eberhardt hofmann , another of the paper 's editors .
he gives the southwest german word " rivir " as an example .
" it does n't mean river and it does n't mean fluss -lrb- the german word for " river . " -rrb-
it means a dry river . " in 1916 , the paper was still called der kriegsbote -lrb- war courier -rrb- and published excerpts from the emperor 's speeches and war reportage from world war one . today , however , the topics are different , said hoffman .
" land reform , criminality , sometimes natural phenomena , like our rainy season .
and , oh yeah , the budget , and the fight against corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmer martin wucher is one of namibia 's german speaking minority editor doro greve said she thinks it is very important to cover namibian topics and make an effort to get away from purely german news . " i sometimes think some of our readers are a little bit stuck in the 1980s .
i think it is our job to slowly but surely bring the readers up to the present time and say , ' hey , this is namibia today .
this is new !
and come along with us , stand up and be seen ! '
because we see quite often that german speakers do n't really want to get involved and open up to the public .
and i think if we can help a little , as a newspaper we have really accomplished something . " ' i know i have arrived ' one steady allgemeine zeitung reader is wolfgang , who has paid regular visits to namibia for the past 25 years .
for him , the az and namibia are inseparable . " for me , the az personifies namibia .
it 's like fish river canyon or the spitzkoppe -lrb- mountain -rrb- .
it is a cultural institution of this country , " he said .
" when i fly into -lrb- namibian capital -rrb- windhoek and drive into town and sit with a cool beer , and i have the az in my hand - then i know i have arrived .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .

that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .

" that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" he had with his concept created the perfect synthesis between modern architecture and the building 's historical roots .

these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building was a ruin after wwii they come in all weather and wait patiently at the entrance - visitors from both germany and abroad - for whom a berlin trip without a visit to the reichstag would feel incomplete . since about seven years ago , around 10,000 people visit daily .
that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .
inside , a mirror-clad funnel illuminates the assembly hall .
and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" he had with his concept created the perfect synthesis between modern architecture and the building 's historical roots .
it mirrors the history of this building and its present and future through its design . " arriving in the present thierse , formerly president of the bundestag , was there that day in april 1999 , when the first meeting of the parliament opened in the rebuilt reichstag .
it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .
" this contrast between the old and the new is so well connected .
i think the architecture is very successful and representing the future of the building , and its past .

not only is the german government considering banning smoking in public places but now the chancellor has thrown her weight behind the ban that would end germany 's status as a haven for smokers and bring it into line with several other european countries . in an interview published in the weekend tabloid bild am so n n tag , angela merkel said that she supported the recent calls for a ban on smoking in public buildings led by consumer affairs minister horst seehofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-smoker merkel wants to protect non-smokers " i always argue for a sense of proportion with such bans , but i find the demand for a general smoking ban in public buildings legitimate , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , adding that she expected a decision on " better protection for non-smokers " to be taken some time this year with an implementation penciled in for 2007 . " i see in neighboring countries that freedom does not go under when tough rules are drawn up to protect non-smokers , " merkel , who said she used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day before quitting , was quoted as saying . earlier this month , seehofer said he hoped that a ban would be in place in germany by 2007 and that the issue would be put on parliament 's agenda when it reconvenes after the summer recess . seehofer added that he thought it unacceptable that people could just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary .

of the victims , some 37 were children .
the european press reacted harshly monday to the deadly offensive . the bombing of qana " fatally reminds us of the 102 civilians who were killed by israeli grenades in a unifil -lrb- united nations interim force in lebanon -rrb- camp in 1996 in the very same place , " wrote germany 's die tageszeitu n g .
israel 's rhetoric and the reaction of the international community are the same as they were 10 years ago , according to the paper .
an immediate , unconditional ceasefire would mean victory for hezbollah .
" without hasty military success , qana 2006 could become for the israeli army what qana 1996 became : the writing on the wall that preceded its withdrawal from lebanon . " " this bloodbath is only creating more hate , more terrorism , " wrote belgium 's le soir .
" if it continues like this , all the lebanese people will soon find themselves under the banner of the hezbollah . "
the events in qana could repeat themselves , continued the paper , and perhaps hezbollah will manage to bomb tel aviv .
" and then what response would it take to even up the score ?
let us stop here .
please , stop ! " " the blood from qana has splattered on everyone 's face , " wrote la repubblica in italy .
" it 's the blood of the innocent , " which has revealed the raw horror of this conflict , " and wo n't be easy to wipe it off . "
lebanon is a country that is harboring an " untamed guerilla , " continued the paper , but which is also " practically the only democratic society in the arab world .
blood has rained down on all those who are responsible for it : the direct and indirect protagonists , but also the powerful and powerless by-standers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 civilians were killed in israel 's 1996 attack on qana " the events in lebanon not only show that there is no longer a real anti-terror coalition in today 's world .
as paradoxical as it may sound , there is n't a war against terrorism either , " wrote russia 's kommersa n t .
" if , in a war like that in lebanon , which is conducted with the most modern and accurate weapons , 10 times as many children are killed as armed men , it can no longer be called a war against terrorism . " " moral justification for the use of violence is demanded of democracies , " wrote the dutch newspaper de volkskra n t , " or else the violence can be turned back on the perpetrators , which now seems to be the case . "
it would not be wise for israel to cultivate a camp mentality and hide behind its own moral correctness , according to the paper .
instead , " israel has to make use of the moment to critically examine its conduct and ask itself whether the disadvantages are gradually starting to outweigh the advantages . "
the us should insist on this , continued the paper .
" qana should be a turning point after three weeks of war , and the casualties there should be the last .

sunday 's poll put her approval rating at 54 percent .
those unhappy with the chancellor rose to 45 percent from 35 percent in the previous poll . merkel enjoyed a sustained early popularity rating due to a round of highly impressive performances on the international stage and a pragmatic approach to domestic governance at home .
the dip in approval could be attributed to the overall performance of her government , the survey suggested . germa n s see cha n cellor as " importa n t " more encouragingly , 70 percent of germans wanted merkel to play " an important role " in future - a key measure of popularity .

not only is the german government considering banning smoking in public places but now the chancellor has thrown her weight behind the ban that would end germany 's status as a haven for smokers and bring it into line with several other european countries . in an interview published in the weekend tabloid bild am so n n tag , angela merkel said that she supported the recent calls for a ban on smoking in public buildings led by consumer affairs minister horst seehofer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-smoker merkel wants to protect non-smokers " i always argue for a sense of proportion with such bans , but i find the demand for a general smoking ban in public buildings legitimate , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , adding that she expected a decision on " better protection for non-smokers " to be taken some time this year with an implementation penciled in for 2007 . " i see in neighboring countries that freedom does not go under when tough rules are drawn up to protect non-smokers , " merkel , who said she used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day before quitting , was quoted as saying . earlier this month , seehofer said he hoped that a ban would be in place in germany by 2007 and that the issue would be put on parliament 's agenda when it reconvenes after the summer recess . seehofer added that he thought it unacceptable that people could just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?
the lack of response was deafening . " poor , poor baby , " the old lady must have thought .
" where is his mother ? " she knew exactly the type : those skinny ladies with too much makeup who seem to be surgically attached to their shopping bags .
those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .
in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .
we become resolute heroes despite the weather .
nothing can stop us . the gentle lady of koblenz - a law-abiding citizen par excellence - did what she thought was the only right thing to do when faced with an obvious case of negligence .
she could n't really go directly to her favorite tv judge , so she called the police .
she reported the incident and asked for prompt action .
a child was in desperate need for help . a different genre that was the point at which the afternoon court drama turned into an evening crime show , a " csi koblenz " of sorts .
the police arrived in no time , set up the perimeter , investigated the scene , developed a profile and came to a shocking conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous german nursery rhyme starts with " eins , zwei , polizei , drei , vier , offizier " there was no crime scene .
no clues were uncovered .
not a single suspect was apprehended .
in fact , not even a single victim was found . " foul play , " some people would say .

the koblenz police reported on monday that nobody was apprehended because the screaming child turned out to be , in fact , a 25-year-old talking parrot . sprechen sie deutsch ? the parrot - who got a little raucous while showing off his latest linguistic trick - could have been charged with disturbing public peace , but that would have sent a wrong message to all the foreigners considering enrolling in a german language course at the goethe institute .
nobody should be discouraged from learning the slightly-larger-than-life language of schiller and heine , even parrots . we should keep in mind that learning a foreign language is not easy if you come from a species whose idea of a kiss is synonymous with a sharp bite .
parrots have tongues and vocal chords that let them sing better than most german teenage pop stars .
but they are no angelina jolie : they have no lips .
which means that bilabial sounds such as " m " and " b " are close to impossible for them to articulate properly , making a parrot 's cry of " mama " even more impressive . not to mention that nobody should get arrested for trying to overcome the big linguistic divide .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?
the lack of response was deafening . " poor , poor baby , " the old lady must have thought .
" where is his mother ? " she knew exactly the type : those skinny ladies with too much makeup who seem to be surgically attached to their shopping bags .
those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .
in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .
we become resolute heroes despite the weather .
nothing can stop us . the gentle lady of koblenz - a law-abiding citizen par excellence - did what she thought was the only right thing to do when faced with an obvious case of negligence .
she could n't really go directly to her favorite tv judge , so she called the police .
she reported the incident and asked for prompt action .
a child was in desperate need for help . a different genre that was the point at which the afternoon court drama turned into an evening crime show , a " csi koblenz " of sorts .
the police arrived in no time , set up the perimeter , investigated the scene , developed a profile and came to a shocking conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous german nursery rhyme starts with " eins , zwei , polizei , drei , vier , offizier " there was no crime scene .
no clues were uncovered .
not a single suspect was apprehended .
in fact , not even a single victim was found . " foul play , " some people would say .
" the police officer in charge is a crook ! " but that would be jumping for conclusions .
the koblenz police reported on monday that nobody was apprehended because the screaming child turned out to be , in fact , a 25-year-old talking parrot . sprechen sie deutsch ? the parrot - who got a little raucous while showing off his latest linguistic trick - could have been charged with disturbing public peace , but that would have sent a wrong message to all the foreigners considering enrolling in a german language course at the goethe institute .
nobody should be discouraged from learning the slightly-larger-than-life language of schiller and heine , even parrots . we should keep in mind that learning a foreign language is not easy if you come from a species whose idea of a kiss is synonymous with a sharp bite .
parrots have tongues and vocal chords that let them sing better than most german teenage pop stars .
but they are no angelina jolie : they have no lips .
which means that bilabial sounds such as " m " and " b " are close to impossible for them to articulate properly , making a parrot 's cry of " mama " even more impressive . not to mention that nobody should get arrested for trying to overcome the big linguistic divide .

" what we expect is an immediate cease-fire and the application of what was demanded ... that is the setting up of humanitarian corridors , " one eu diplomat said on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks . " almost all the europeans want a truce or a cease-fire . " britain joins us in calling for un force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops in lebanon would be given peacekeeping powers britain , with its close ally the united states , has pushed instead for agreement at the united nations to deploy an international force to secure the israel-lebanon border and ensure that any cease-fire is sustainable . but finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the eu presidency , said in helsinki that agreement including britain was possible . " i expect the eu to be able to act with consensus including great britain , " he told journalists .
" there have also been discussions with the british prime minister , " he said . france for its part is seeking to seize the diplomatic initiative . foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said monday that a " cease-fire is a priority and an urgent request .
we need an immediate cease-fire and an end to the -lrb- israeli -rrb- blockade . " an eu official noted : " there are always different sensitivities among member states , but this is something we have to live with and try to be as effective as possible . " tuesday 's meeting comes after israel announced the suspension of air strikes for 48 hours after its war planes killed 52 civilians , about 30 of them children according to police , in the lebanese village of qana .
the eu has condemned the attack . in all , the lebanese health ministry estimated that 750 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded in lebanon since israel launched its air , sea and land assault after hezbollah seized two of its soldiers on july 12 . hezbollah fighters meanwhile have fired between 1,700 and 1,900 rockets at northern israel , killing some 18 civilians and wounding more than 300 people . cease-fire and aid to be discussed a german government spokesman said monday that the pause in air strikes - called to investigate the qana killings - is " a positive sign " that a lasting cease-fire could be within reach . during their talks , the ministers will be briefed by external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , who just returned from a trip to the region , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has agreed safe passage for food and medicine aid efforts will also figure high on the agenda , following the european commission 's announcement last week of a further 40 million euros -lrb- $ 51 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to help the victims . " we would like to see the new member states committing more humanitarian aid .
i think they will do , because there is a lot of pressure from public opinion , " said amadeu altafaj , spokesman on eu aid issues . as an aid provider , the bloc has influence with lebanon and the palestinians - also up for discussion tuesday - but it holds little sway with israel and is reluctant to compromise what small leverage it has . the foreign ministers are not expected to draw up formal conclusions but want to show that the eu " remains active " on the crisis and that its members are " in phase , " another eu diplomat said . " it 's obvious that we have to move very quickly now .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv . an elderly lady from the german city of koblenz was recently woken out of her summer slumber by the screaming she heard coming from one of her neighbor 's homes . the piercing , high-pitched voice - obviously belonging to a neglected child - immediately dragged the old , unsuspecting woman into a nightmarish world of afternoon court tv shows , in which women are sued for going shopping rather than taking care of their children . " mother , oh mother ! , " the child kept screaming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is more important , family or shopping ?
the lack of response was deafening . " poor , poor baby , " the old lady must have thought .
" where is his mother ? " she knew exactly the type : those skinny ladies with too much makeup who seem to be surgically attached to their shopping bags .
those self-confident feminists who care more about their careers than creating a nurturing home for their family .
those flippant , frivolous miniskirt-wearing flirts who never cooked a decent meal in their lives . oh , yes , she knew what they were like .
at the mere sight of those mindless little things prancing into the courtroom , judge judy and her german counterpart richterin barbara salesch have been known to metamorphose into raging bulls exuding righteously indignant judicial steam out of their honorable , slightly oversized , ears . a hot summer germany has been hit with an unprecedented heat wave this summer .
in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .
we become resolute heroes despite the weather .
nothing can stop us . the gentle lady of koblenz - a law-abiding citizen par excellence - did what she thought was the only right thing to do when faced with an obvious case of negligence .
she could n't really go directly to her favorite tv judge , so she called the police .
she reported the incident and asked for prompt action .

no clues were uncovered .
not a single suspect was apprehended .
in fact , not even a single victim was found . " foul play , " some people would say .
" the police officer in charge is a crook ! " but that would be jumping for conclusions .
the koblenz police reported on monday that nobody was apprehended because the screaming child turned out to be , in fact , a 25-year-old talking parrot . sprechen sie deutsch ? the parrot - who got a little raucous while showing off his latest linguistic trick - could have been charged with disturbing public peace , but that would have sent a wrong message to all the foreigners considering enrolling in a german language course at the goethe institute .
nobody should be discouraged from learning the slightly-larger-than-life language of schiller and heine , even parrots . we should keep in mind that learning a foreign language is not easy if you come from a species whose idea of a kiss is synonymous with a sharp bite .
parrots have tongues and vocal chords that let them sing better than most german teenage pop stars .
but they are no angelina jolie : they have no lips .
which means that bilabial sounds such as " m " and " b " are close to impossible for them to articulate properly , making a parrot 's cry of " mama " even more impressive . not to mention that nobody should get arrested for trying to overcome the big linguistic divide .

in this kind of climatic misfortune , most people become slow-motion caricatures of themselves living in a permanent state of hangover or extended mediterranean siesta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a sizzling hot summer in germany this year but as we grow older and as our thermoregulatory system begins to live a life of its own - making some senior citizens wear woolen hats in the middle of august or refuse to go to bed without a hot water bottle - we also develop an ability to act against the elements .
we become resolute heroes despite the weather .
nothing can stop us . the gentle lady of koblenz - a law-abiding citizen par excellence - did what she thought was the only right thing to do when faced with an obvious case of negligence .

she reported the incident and asked for prompt action .

no clues were uncovered .
not a single suspect was apprehended .
in fact , not even a single victim was found . " foul play , " some people would say .
" the police officer in charge is a crook ! " but that would be jumping for conclusions .
the koblenz police reported on monday that nobody was apprehended because the screaming child turned out to be , in fact , a 25-year-old talking parrot . sprechen sie deutsch ? the parrot - who got a little raucous while showing off his latest linguistic trick - could have been charged with disturbing public peace , but that would have sent a wrong message to all the foreigners considering enrolling in a german language course at the goethe institute .
nobody should be discouraged from learning the slightly-larger-than-life language of schiller and heine , even parrots . we should keep in mind that learning a foreign language is not easy if you come from a species whose idea of a kiss is synonymous with a sharp bite .
parrots have tongues and vocal chords that let them sing better than most german teenage pop stars .
but they are no angelina jolie : they have no lips .
which means that bilabial sounds such as " m " and " b " are close to impossible for them to articulate properly , making a parrot 's cry of " mama " even more impressive . not to mention that nobody should get arrested for trying to overcome the big linguistic divide .

it is kind of like a guestbook in which visitors can write down their thoughts , wishes or concerns . sometimes people even write down a note of thanks , said pastor peter klamt of the himmelkron autobahn church in bavaria . the pastor often creates special services for his church , like the " siren service " in november for fire fighters , police and medical personnel . and , three times a year - including july 30 , which is " autobahn church day " - pastor klamt blesses the cars and trucks that roll up in front of his motorway chapel . michael hollenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism .

" the suspension of our aerial activities does not signify in any way the end to the war , " ramon told israeli army radio . " on the contrary , this decision will allow us to win this war and lessen international pressure . " to stop the war at this stage would mean a victory for hezbollah and for international terrorism , manipulated by iran and syria , " added ramon , who is considered close to prime minister ehud olmert and is a member of the nation 's security cabinet . another cabinet member considered close to olmert , minister of immigrant absorption zeev boim , told public radio that the suspension in aerial attacks was " temporary and limited . " " we took this decision to take into account the interests of the united states , our loyal and courageous ally that finds itself in a difficult position because of its support of israel , " boim said . boim added the halt in air attacks would not apply " if we see attempts by the hezbollah to restock itself with arms and rockets from syria . " hassan fadlallah , a hezbollah member of parliament , said a limited suspension of israeli air strikes into lebanon was not enough to halt the conflict with the shiite muslim group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel will continue its ground offensive " the war will end when israel stops its aggression comprehensively and totally and pulls out from the points -lrb- its ground forces -rrb- entered in south lebanon , " fadlallah told reuters . " if the aim of israel 's decision to suspend air raids is to absorb the international outrage over the qana massacre and then proceed with ground bombardment , that means israel has not stopped its aggression , " fadlallah added . britain , germany welcome suspension british prime minister tony blair welcomed the temporary halt to the israeli bombardment of lebanon , saying he was optimistic of the chances of an end to hostilities . " what 's important now is that we have a real chance of getting a united nations security council resolution which will give us the opportunity both to have the complete cessation of hostilities , not merely a temporary one , but on a sustainable , lasting basis , " said blair . " what has happened to qana shows that this is a situation that simply can not continue , " he added .
" i 've been conducting a serious of urgent course negotiations with other leaders .
i 've also spoken to prime minister siniora of the lebanon .
i think there is a basis for an agreement that would allow us to get a un resolution . . hostilities have got to stop .
and stop on all sides . "
gernot erler , a german deputy foreign minister , said on germany 's zdf television that the suspension of air strikes was a sign that the united states was beginning to exert its influence with positive effects in the middle east crisis . " what -lrb- us secretary of state -rrb- condoleezza rice achieved in israel in the last few hours is far more than one could actually expect , and we also have the impression that great pressure is now being exercised by america , " erler said . " i think that , in america , there is an understanding of the danger to the standing of both israel and america that is linked with qana , with this tragedy , " he added . qa n a bombi n g leads to limited ceasefire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of civilians were killed in the war 's deadliest strike the announcement of the suspension of air strikes came after the un security council held an emergency meeting after israeli bombs struck a building in the southern lebanese village of qana , killing dozens of civilians , many of them children sunday 's strike , the deadliest yet , prompted rice to call for a un resolution that could bring about a complete halt to fighting . the bloodshed in qana , which israel said was accidental , has triggered outrage across the world and increased international pressure on the united states to back an immediate end to the fighting . rice believes full ceasefire i n sight after a long night of discussions in jerusalem , rice said a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah could be achieved this week .
world powers will meet again on monday to discuss the next possible developments in the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with israel 's prime minister ehud olmert rice said during her discussions with top israeli officials she had found consensus on several issues that she thinks could form the political basis for a solution to the crisis . but the statements from israel regarding the 48-hour air strike suspension suggested there was no indication from israeli politicians that they were actually willing to agree to an immediate and complete ceasefire . israel urged to stop the war international criticism is growing and many leaders have demanded more urgency from israel to stop the fighting . france , germany and several other western nations have also called for an immediate ceasefire in the region . meanwhile , israeli air strikes hit eastern lebanon early on monday , with two raids near the syrian border .
however , israel said the strikes had been carried out before the 48-hour suspension came into effect . when the members of the un security council meet this week , they will also discuss the establishment of an international stabilization force . the force would then be deployed as soon as possible after a un resolution and create a buffer zone between southern lebanon and israel . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we barely escaped death " a german-lebanese family from the town of lünen found themselves under israeli bombardment .

twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence . it has had a turbulent history . it was here in the reichstag that kaiser wilhelm ii ridiculed the parliament as a regime " monkey house . "
it was here in 1914 that social democrat karl liebknecht as a member of the upper house voted against funding the war .
and it was here that philipp scheidemann proclaimed the first german republic . in 1933 , the building went up and flames and in 1945 , it was heavily bombed .
the interior was heavily plundered and the badly-damaged historical dome demolished . after world war ii , the building lay orphaned near the east german border with occasional tourists peeking over the wall at it .
it was used occasionally as an exhibition hall .
in 1995 , the artist christo was allowed to wrap the entire building in silver fabric , an event that brought millions to the building . today , the reichstag is the german parliament .
and the building is , in the meantime , regarded as the most publicly efficient parliament building in the world .
but it is also a political landmark that has transformed itself into an architectural one . a main attraction " we are tourists from denmark and we want to see the dome , " said one tourist . " there is a lot of history behind this place which is really why we wanted to come here , " said another .
" we all have seen many old pictures of it , including the one of it burning .
we wanted to see it up close .
besides , it is a landmark from our capital city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building was a ruin after wwii they come in all weather and wait patiently at the entrance - visitors from both germany and abroad - for whom a berlin trip without a visit to the reichstag would feel incomplete . since about seven years ago , around 10,000 people visit daily .
that is not only because it is the seat of the german parliament but also because of the elaborate reconstruction by star british architect sir norman foster that transformed the formerly oppressive and bulky building into a welcoming and modern public assembly building . " my solution was considered radical , " said foster .
" where else in the world can one enter the building with politicians and ascend to a public square , all under one roof ?
then go farther over meandering ramps to a viewing platform , from where one can look directly into the assembly room . " gloomy to glamorous with foster 's design , and the abandonment of grandiosity and classical temple facades , the gloomy reichstag became a completely different building .
it has a completely new assembly hall with the historical shell behind glass , a lot of light and the newest technological devices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norman foster wanted to bring past and future together the masterstroke was the glass dome , though , which is visited by the public daily .
inside , a mirror-clad funnel illuminates the assembly hall .
and at the same time , stale air from the room can be released naturally through the passage . " that this building with its interior and exterior structure can and has fulfilled expectations , that visitors can absorb and accept its scale and design rather than be alienated by it is thanks to sir norman foster , " said wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
" he had with his concept created the perfect synthesis between modern architecture and the building 's historical roots .
it mirrors the history of this building and its present and future through its design . " arriving in the present thierse , formerly president of the bundestag , was there that day in april 1999 , when the first meeting of the parliament opened in the rebuilt reichstag .
it was a decade after the fall of the berlin wall before german political life arrived in berlin - and the tattered building that houses it arrived in the present . today , politicians from around germany mingle in the building with visitors ' groups .
as they wander the wide hallways , they witness relics from another time now interspersed with works from international contemporary artists . " fabulous , " said one visitor .
" this contrast between the old and the new is so well connected .
i think the architecture is very successful and representing the future of the building , and its past .

the city draws visitors from across the world , but the thermal springs on which bath was founded have been off-limits since the 1970s , their mineral-enriched waters - and reputed ' healing powers ' - wasted .
the rooftop pool boasts views across the city residents and tourists have been unable to do any more than taste the sulphurous liquid at the roman baths .
those more used to the spa towns of continental europe have been left perplexed at the lack of an opportunity to bathe in a city whose name is derived from that very pursuit .
" bath would not exist were it not for the hot springs , " said local councillor nicole o 'flaherty , one of the spa 's most vocal supporters .
" but for the past 20 or so years - for the first time in 1,200 years - the people of bath have not been able to use their springs . "
the thermal springs , which produce some 1.2 million litres of hot water every day , were closed off in 1978 amid fears over the safety of the water source after a woman died of legionnaires ' disease .
the listed buildings which had housed the various spas fell into disrepair and the city built on its spring lost some of its purpose .
millennium project in the intervening years , five attempts were made to rejuvenate and reopen the thermal waters to the public , but each eventually failed , until the city hit upon the idea of doing so as a millennium project .
but as costs spiralled to £ 45m , three times over the original budget , and planned opening dates came and went , many residents of the city - whose council tax money was being used to fund the scheme - lost heart .
" the whole thing 's been a bit of a catastrophe really , " said local resident christine hawkins .
" it has really annoyed me that they have spent so much on it . "
staff have been busy with the final touches in pictures : spa unveiled squabbles between bath and north east somerset council and builders mowlem turned into full-blown rows , which went all the way to the high court , delayed work even further .
but now the wait is over .
the pools have been filled , although the steam room smelled of turpentine rather than the delicate scent of lavender , jasmine and eucalyptus as the final work was being completed .
contractors have been busy with the finishing touches , lifeguards have been trying out the rooftop pool and beauty therapists have been practising their reiki massage and hot stone therapy .
listed buildings charlotte hanna , spokeswoman for the complex 's operators , thermae bath spa , said it was a very exciting time .
" we are really looking forward to welcoming our first customers and are just eager to get on with it . "
and , for nicole o 'flaherty at least , it has been worth the wait .
" it is like waking from a nightmare to see the finished building , how fantastic it is .
" in the middle of a world heritage site , as well as restoring five listed buildings , we now have an unashamedly modern building , an iconic building . "
what makes bath 's water so special : sulphate chloride calcium sodium hydrogen carbonate silicate spa 's highs and lows but christine hawkins said she had reservations that the building design was not the right choice .
" the building does n't really go with bath - the city is roman or georgian - this looks really out of place , it does n't fit in .
" i do n't know if it will really benefit us - i think it 's more for the tourists .
" it 's not something which appeals to me personally , but then i 've lived here all my life and i 've never been to the roman baths . "
however hotelier matthew stevenson said he was convinced : " bath is a busy city anyway , it is very popular with people looking for short breaks , but the spa will mean we can really offer the complete package . "
special place visitor numbers to bath , particularly from the us , have declined in recent years , and it is hoped the new spa will increase tourism .
nicole o 'flaherty said : " tourism is a very important factor in the city 's economy - it brings in £ 400m a year ... so it is vital to make sure tourists keep coming to the city . "
whether the spa will be top of tourists ' must-see lists is unknown but it may take time to convince them to return , after a host of building problems and rows between the council and contractors saw the complex 's opening date delayed time and time again .
mr stevenson , manager of the abbey hotel , said : " we 've had people coming to stay with us for years , asking what time the spa opens , and we have had to say , ' well , it will be a few years yet ' . "
" being a spa town without a spa has been something of an issue , obviously . "
the city will get its spa back on monday , august 7 , and while people may not be queuing around the corner to get in just yet , the spa has been inundated with bookings .
" i hope it will create a greater pride in what is already a very beautiful , special place , " said charlotte hanna .
" i hope it will raise awareness of the importance of our heritage , because the thermal waters flowing under the streets of bath are the lifeblood of the city . "
nicole o 'flaherty said : " we could have done no end of projects for the millennium . "
" but this is simply perfect for bath - it reconnects the city with its soul . "

however hotelier matthew stevenson said he was convinced : " bath is a busy city anyway , it is very popular with people looking for short breaks , but the spa will mean we can really offer the complete package . "
special place visitor numbers to bath , particularly from the us , have declined in recent years , and it is hoped the new spa will increase tourism .
nicole o 'flaherty said : " tourism is a very important factor in the city 's economy - it brings in £ 400m a year ... so it is vital to make sure tourists keep coming to the city . "
whether the spa will be top of tourists ' must-see lists is unknown but it may take time to convince them to return , after a host of building problems and rows between the council and contractors saw the complex 's opening date delayed time and time again .
mr stevenson , manager of the abbey hotel , said : " we 've had people coming to stay with us for years , asking what time the spa opens , and we have had to say , ' well , it will be a few years yet ' . "
" being a spa town without a spa has been something of an issue , obviously . "
the city will get its spa back on monday , august 7 , and while people may not be queuing around the corner to get in just yet , the spa has been inundated with bookings .
" i hope it will create a greater pride in what is already a very beautiful , special place , " said charlotte hanna .
" i hope it will raise awareness of the importance of our heritage , because the thermal waters flowing under the streets of bath are the lifeblood of the city . "
nicole o 'flaherty said : " we could have done no end of projects for the millennium . "
" but this is simply perfect for bath - it reconnects the city with its soul . "

the city draws visitors from across the world , but the thermal springs on which bath was founded have been off-limits since the 1970s , their mineral-enriched waters - and reputed ' healing powers ' - wasted .
the rooftop pool boasts views across the city residents and tourists have been unable to do any more than taste the sulphurous liquid at the roman baths .
those more used to the spa towns of continental europe have been left perplexed at the lack of an opportunity to bathe in a city whose name is derived from that very pursuit .
" bath would not exist were it not for the hot springs , " said local councillor nicole o 'flaherty , one of the spa 's most vocal supporters .
" but for the past 20 or so years - for the first time in 1,200 years - the people of bath have not been able to use their springs . "
the thermal springs , which produce some 1.2 million litres of hot water every day , were closed off in 1978 amid fears over the safety of the water source after a woman died of legionnaires ' disease .
the listed buildings which had housed the various spas fell into disrepair and the city built on its spring lost some of its purpose .
millennium project in the intervening years , five attempts were made to rejuvenate and reopen the thermal waters to the public , but each eventually failed , until the city hit upon the idea of doing so as a millennium project .
but as costs spiralled to £ 45m , three times over the original budget , and planned opening dates came and went , many residents of the city - whose council tax money was being used to fund the scheme - lost heart .
" the whole thing 's been a bit of a catastrophe really , " said local resident christine hawkins .
" it has really annoyed me that they have spent so much on it . "
staff have been busy with the final touches in pictures : spa unveiled squabbles between bath and north east somerset council and builders mowlem turned into full-blown rows , which went all the way to the high court , delayed work even further .
but now the wait is over .
the pools have been filled , although the steam room smelled of turpentine rather than the delicate scent of lavender , jasmine and eucalyptus as the final work was being completed .
contractors have been busy with the finishing touches , lifeguards have been trying out the rooftop pool and beauty therapists have been practising their reiki massage and hot stone therapy .
listed buildings charlotte hanna , spokeswoman for the complex 's operators , thermae bath spa , said it was a very exciting time .
" we are really looking forward to welcoming our first customers and are just eager to get on with it . "
and , for nicole o 'flaherty at least , it has been worth the wait .
" it is like waking from a nightmare to see the finished building , how fantastic it is .
" in the middle of a world heritage site , as well as restoring five listed buildings , we now have an unashamedly modern building , an iconic building . "
what makes bath 's water so special : sulphate chloride calcium sodium hydrogen carbonate silicate spa 's highs and lows but christine hawkins said she had reservations that the building design was not the right choice .

the city draws visitors from across the world , but the thermal springs on which bath was founded have been off-limits since the 1970s , their mineral-enriched waters - and reputed ' healing powers ' - wasted .
the rooftop pool boasts views across the city residents and tourists have been unable to do any more than taste the sulphurous liquid at the roman baths .
those more used to the spa towns of continental europe have been left perplexed at the lack of an opportunity to bathe in a city whose name is derived from that very pursuit .
" bath would not exist were it not for the hot springs , " said local councillor nicole o 'flaherty , one of the spa 's most vocal supporters .
" but for the past 20 or so years - for the first time in 1,200 years - the people of bath have not been able to use their springs . "
the thermal springs , which produce some 1.2 million litres of hot water every day , were closed off in 1978 amid fears over the safety of the water source after a woman died of legionnaires ' disease .
the listed buildings which had housed the various spas fell into disrepair and the city built on its spring lost some of its purpose .
millennium project in the intervening years , five attempts were made to rejuvenate and reopen the thermal waters to the public , but each eventually failed , until the city hit upon the idea of doing so as a millennium project .
but as costs spiralled to £ 45m , three times over the original budget , and planned opening dates came and went , many residents of the city - whose council tax money was being used to fund the scheme - lost heart .
" the whole thing 's been a bit of a catastrophe really , " said local resident christine hawkins .
" it has really annoyed me that they have spent so much on it . "
staff have been busy with the final touches in pictures : spa unveiled squabbles between bath and north east somerset council and builders mowlem turned into full-blown rows , which went all the way to the high court , delayed work even further .
but now the wait is over .
the pools have been filled , although the steam room smelled of turpentine rather than the delicate scent of lavender , jasmine and eucalyptus as the final work was being completed .
contractors have been busy with the finishing touches , lifeguards have been trying out the rooftop pool and beauty therapists have been practising their reiki massage and hot stone therapy .
listed buildings charlotte hanna , spokeswoman for the complex 's operators , thermae bath spa , said it was a very exciting time .
" we are really looking forward to welcoming our first customers and are just eager to get on with it . "
and , for nicole o 'flaherty at least , it has been worth the wait .
" it is like waking from a nightmare to see the finished building , how fantastic it is .
" in the middle of a world heritage site , as well as restoring five listed buildings , we now have an unashamedly modern building , an iconic building . "
what makes bath 's water so special : sulphate chloride calcium sodium hydrogen carbonate silicate spa 's highs and lows but christine hawkins said she had reservations that the building design was not the right choice .
" the building does n't really go with bath - the city is roman or georgian - this looks really out of place , it does n't fit in .
" i do n't know if it will really benefit us - i think it 's more for the tourists .
" it 's not something which appeals to me personally , but then i 've lived here all my life and i 've never been to the roman baths . "
however hotelier matthew stevenson said he was convinced : " bath is a busy city anyway , it is very popular with people looking for short breaks , but the spa will mean we can really offer the complete package . "
special place visitor numbers to bath , particularly from the us , have declined in recent years , and it is hoped the new spa will increase tourism .
nicole o 'flaherty said : " tourism is a very important factor in the city 's economy - it brings in £ 400m a year ... so it is vital to make sure tourists keep coming to the city . "
whether the spa will be top of tourists ' must-see lists is unknown but it may take time to convince them to return , after a host of building problems and rows between the council and contractors saw the complex 's opening date delayed time and time again .
mr stevenson , manager of the abbey hotel , said : " we 've had people coming to stay with us for years , asking what time the spa opens , and we have had to say , ' well , it will be a few years yet ' . "
" being a spa town without a spa has been something of an issue , obviously . "
the city will get its spa back on monday , august 7 , and while people may not be queuing around the corner to get in just yet , the spa has been inundated with bookings .
" i hope it will create a greater pride in what is already a very beautiful , special place , " said charlotte hanna .
" i hope it will raise awareness of the importance of our heritage , because the thermal waters flowing under the streets of bath are the lifeblood of the city . "
nicole o 'flaherty said : " we could have done no end of projects for the millennium . "
" but this is simply perfect for bath - it reconnects the city with its soul . "

the thermal springs , which produce some 1.2 million litres of hot water every day , were closed off in 1978 amid fears over the safety of the water source after a woman died of legionnaires ' disease .
the listed buildings which had housed the various spas fell into disrepair and the city built on its spring lost some of its purpose .
millennium project in the intervening years , five attempts were made to rejuvenate and reopen the thermal waters to the public , but each eventually failed , until the city hit upon the idea of doing so as a millennium project .
but as costs spiralled to £ 45m , three times over the original budget , and planned opening dates came and went , many residents of the city - whose council tax money was being used to fund the scheme - lost heart .
" the whole thing 's been a bit of a catastrophe really , " said local resident christine hawkins .
" it has really annoyed me that they have spent so much on it . "
staff have been busy with the final touches in pictures : spa unveiled squabbles between bath and north east somerset council and builders mowlem turned into full-blown rows , which went all the way to the high court , delayed work even further .
but now the wait is over .
the pools have been filled , although the steam room smelled of turpentine rather than the delicate scent of lavender , jasmine and eucalyptus as the final work was being completed .
contractors have been busy with the finishing touches , lifeguards have been trying out the rooftop pool and beauty therapists have been practising their reiki massage and hot stone therapy .
listed buildings charlotte hanna , spokeswoman for the complex 's operators , thermae bath spa , said it was a very exciting time .
" we are really looking forward to welcoming our first customers and are just eager to get on with it . "
and , for nicole o 'flaherty at least , it has been worth the wait .
" it is like waking from a nightmare to see the finished building , how fantastic it is .
" in the middle of a world heritage site , as well as restoring five listed buildings , we now have an unashamedly modern building , an iconic building . "
what makes bath 's water so special : sulphate chloride calcium sodium hydrogen carbonate silicate spa 's highs and lows but christine hawkins said she had reservations that the building design was not the right choice .
" the building does n't really go with bath - the city is roman or georgian - this looks really out of place , it does n't fit in .
" i do n't know if it will really benefit us - i think it 's more for the tourists .
" it 's not something which appeals to me personally , but then i 've lived here all my life and i 've never been to the roman baths . "
however hotelier matthew stevenson said he was convinced : " bath is a busy city anyway , it is very popular with people looking for short breaks , but the spa will mean we can really offer the complete package . "
special place visitor numbers to bath , particularly from the us , have declined in recent years , and it is hoped the new spa will increase tourism .
nicole o 'flaherty said : " tourism is a very important factor in the city 's economy - it brings in £ 400m a year ... so it is vital to make sure tourists keep coming to the city . "
whether the spa will be top of tourists ' must-see lists is unknown but it may take time to convince them to return , after a host of building problems and rows between the council and contractors saw the complex 's opening date delayed time and time again .
mr stevenson , manager of the abbey hotel , said : " we 've had people coming to stay with us for years , asking what time the spa opens , and we have had to say , ' well , it will be a few years yet ' . "
" being a spa town without a spa has been something of an issue , obviously . "
the city will get its spa back on monday , august 7 , and while people may not be queuing around the corner to get in just yet , the spa has been inundated with bookings .
" i hope it will create a greater pride in what is already a very beautiful , special place , " said charlotte hanna .
" i hope it will raise awareness of the importance of our heritage , because the thermal waters flowing under the streets of bath are the lifeblood of the city . "
nicole o 'flaherty said : " we could have done no end of projects for the millennium . "
" but this is simply perfect for bath - it reconnects the city with its soul . "

the cost of the project has already risen to £ 19m 2002 - the project is originally scheduled to open in 2002 , but as the year passes , work on the site continues with no end in sight 2003 six delays in seven months mean the spa will not be open in time for the beginning of the city 's tourist season - the delays are reported to be costing banes £ 30,000 per week paint on the steam room walls melted in the heat may - the spa is delayed for the eighth time , sparking fears it may not be ready for its official opening august - the planned ' official ' opening day .
the three tenors take part in a celebratory concert , but the spa remains closed - the council says it will open in october september - a row breaks out between the council and developer mowlem over paint finishes in the spa pools .

later in the month banes agrees to plough an extra £ 3.5m into the project as thermae bath spa is forced to lay off staff .
to compound the misery , wansdyke mp dan norris criticises the spa , which he says costs his constituents £ 116 each february - developer mowlem says it will take over the spa project , finish it and have the spa open within six months for a fixed price of £ 26m , but the offer is rejected .
april - the council fires mowlem may - banes says the spa is on target to open at easter 2006 , but that its cost will rise by another £ 2m .

but in modern times it is blood - not water and wine - that is indelibly linked with the town , the blood of lebanese civilians killed in israeli bombing .
in 1996 , one of the deadliest single events of the whole arab-israeli conflict took place there - the shelling of a un base where hundreds of local people were sheltering .
more than 100 were killed and another 100 injured , cut down by israeli anti-personnel shells that explode in the air sending a lethal shower of shrapnel to the ground .
ten years later , the town is again in the headlines , this time because of a single massive bomb dropped by an israeli aircraft , causing a building to collapse on top of dozens of civilians - many of them children - taking cover in the basement .
both incidents took place during sustained israeli military operations against the hezbollah militant group for firing rockets at israel .
it remains to be seen if the " qana massacre no 2 " - as it 's being called in lebanon - will have the same result as the 1996 tragedy - enormous pressure on israel to curtail its operations , leading to a ceasefire .
israeli denials israel still insists the 18 april 1996 shelling was an accident and that its forces had aimed at a legitimate militant target - a hezbollah military unit firing mortars and rockets from near a base housing fijian troops belonging to the un observer force unifil .
then , as now , israel accused hezbollah of using the civilian population as human shields when they launched their attacks .
however , a un investigation reported in may 1996 that the deaths at the qana base were unlikely to have been the result of an accident , as claimed by the israelis .
the un report , by maj-gen franklin van kappen of the netherlands , cited a shift in the fire patterns and the repeated use of shells with so-called proximity fuses over the small un compound as evidence of an intent to kill people there .
the report also noted the presence of two israeli helicopters and a drone in the skies over qana , " contrary to repeated -lsb- israeli -rsb- denials " , which must have witnessed the bloodbath .
" the pattern of impacts is inconsistent with a normal overshooting of the declared target -lrb- the mortar site -rrb- by a few rounds , as suggested by the israeli forces , " gen van kappen 's report said .
" while the possibility can not be ruled out completely , it is unlikely that the shelling of the united nations compound was the result of gross technical and / or procedural errors , " the report concluded .
strategic location in the current round of israeli bombardments , qana has already been the scene of several controversial incidents , such as the bombing by israel of two lebanese red cross ambulances and the death of a young lebanese photojournalist , layal nejib , also in an air strike on her car .
looking at the map , it is not hard to see the strategic of importance qana in relation to israel and its adversary , hezbollah .
the town lies at the northern edge of the lebanon 's southern uplands which border israel and at the confluence of the five main roads running south-east of the southern city of tyre .
qana and the villages surrounding it are a strong pro-hezbollah area and israel says it has repeatedly been used to fire rockets over the border about 10km -lrb- six miles -rrb- to the south .
israeli officials say leaflets had been dropped in the area warning civilians to leave their homes , so it could step up its anti-hezbollah operations .
however , with the number of civilian cars and convoys which have been bombed on the roads heading to tyre , many residents were too scared to take the israeli warnings or were unable to flee because they had no means of transport .
-lsb- note : the number of people killed in the israeli bombing of qana was later revised .
the washington based human rights group human rights watch investigated the incident and issued a report on 3 august saying that 28 people were known to have died , while 13 people were missing . -rsb-

the report also noted the presence of two israeli helicopters and a drone in the skies over qana , " contrary to repeated -lsb- israeli -rsb- denials " , which must have witnessed the bloodbath .
" the pattern of impacts is inconsistent with a normal overshooting of the declared target -lrb- the mortar site -rrb- by a few rounds , as suggested by the israeli forces , " gen van kappen 's report said .
" while the possibility can not be ruled out completely , it is unlikely that the shelling of the united nations compound was the result of gross technical and / or procedural errors , " the report concluded .
strategic location in the current round of israeli bombardments , qana has already been the scene of several controversial incidents , such as the bombing by israel of two lebanese red cross ambulances and the death of a young lebanese photojournalist , layal nejib , also in an air strike on her car .
looking at the map , it is not hard to see the strategic of importance qana in relation to israel and its adversary , hezbollah .
the town lies at the northern edge of the lebanon 's southern uplands which border israel and at the confluence of the five main roads running south-east of the southern city of tyre .
qana and the villages surrounding it are a strong pro-hezbollah area and israel says it has repeatedly been used to fire rockets over the border about 10km -lrb- six miles -rrb- to the south .
israeli officials say leaflets had been dropped in the area warning civilians to leave their homes , so it could step up its anti-hezbollah operations .
however , with the number of civilian cars and convoys which have been bombed on the roads heading to tyre , many residents were too scared to take the israeli warnings or were unable to flee because they had no means of transport .
-lsb- note : the number of people killed in the israeli bombing of qana was later revised .
the washington based human rights group human rights watch investigated the incident and issued a report on 3 august saying that 28 people were known to have died , while 13 people were missing . -rsb-

more than 100 were killed and another 100 injured , cut down by israeli anti-personnel shells that explode in the air sending a lethal shower of shrapnel to the ground .
