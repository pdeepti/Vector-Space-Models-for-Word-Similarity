" kurz told the dpa news agency in an interview published monday that it was rare that a company 's stock market listing should be delayed as this one has . company managers have unpleasant memories of the autumn of 2004 , when the government and supervisory board broke off preparations for an ipo . bad plan ? after 12 years of reorganization at deutsche bahn , the country 's last big state-owned company , it is clear to the partners in germany 's governing coalition that the time had come for a partial sell-off .

"
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .

schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .

" kurz told the dpa news agency in an interview published monday that it was rare that a company 's stock market listing should be delayed as this one has . company managers have unpleasant memories of the autumn of 2004 , when the government and supervisory board broke off preparations for an ipo . bad plan ? after 12 years of reorganization at deutsche bahn , the country 's last big state-owned company , it is clear to the partners in germany 's governing coalition that the time had come for a partial sell-off .
the sticking point , though , is whether the privatised company should own the rail network , including tracks and stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahn chief hartmut mehdorn kurz also said that deutsche bahn 's planned stock-market debut had been hurt by the privatization model selected by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition government .
under legislation which is to be presented to parliament in march , the federal government is to take over the rail tracks and the railway stations . the government 's plan , which was set out in november , calls on deutsche bahn to manage the tracks for a minimum of 10 years and to issue financial reports each year . but , said kurz : " it however , clearly diminishes the value of the bahn . "
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .
on the other hand , he said growth outside germany would require a major investment . in addition , deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn has so far not set out where the company 's growth was likely to come from , kurz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn agrees to exhibit holocaust photos deutsche bahn , germany 's state-owned national railway , bowed to government appeals on friday and agreed to allow an exhibition on nazi deportations to be shown at train stations across the country .

" kurz told the dpa news agency in an interview published monday that it was rare that a company 's stock market listing should be delayed as this one has . company managers have unpleasant memories of the autumn of 2004 , when the government and supervisory board broke off preparations for an ipo . bad plan ? after 12 years of reorganization at deutsche bahn , the country 's last big state-owned company , it is clear to the partners in germany 's governing coalition that the time had come for a partial sell-off .
the sticking point , though , is whether the privatised company should own the rail network , including tracks and stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahn chief hartmut mehdorn kurz also said that deutsche bahn 's planned stock-market debut had been hurt by the privatization model selected by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition government .
under legislation which is to be presented to parliament in march , the federal government is to take over the rail tracks and the railway stations . the government 's plan , which was set out in november , calls on deutsche bahn to manage the tracks for a minimum of 10 years and to issue financial reports each year . but , said kurz : " it however , clearly diminishes the value of the bahn . "
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .
on the other hand , he said growth outside germany would require a major investment . in addition , deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn has so far not set out where the company 's growth was likely to come from , kurz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn agrees to exhibit holocaust photos deutsche bahn , germany 's state-owned national railway , bowed to government appeals on friday and agreed to allow an exhibition on nazi deportations to be shown at train stations across the country .

" kurz told the dpa news agency in an interview published monday that it was rare that a company 's stock market listing should be delayed as this one has . company managers have unpleasant memories of the autumn of 2004 , when the government and supervisory board broke off preparations for an ipo . bad plan ? after 12 years of reorganization at deutsche bahn , the country 's last big state-owned company , it is clear to the partners in germany 's governing coalition that the time had come for a partial sell-off .
the sticking point , though , is whether the privatised company should own the rail network , including tracks and stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahn chief hartmut mehdorn kurz also said that deutsche bahn 's planned stock-market debut had been hurt by the privatization model selected by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition government .
under legislation which is to be presented to parliament in march , the federal government is to take over the rail tracks and the railway stations . the government 's plan , which was set out in november , calls on deutsche bahn to manage the tracks for a minimum of 10 years and to issue financial reports each year . but , said kurz : " it however , clearly diminishes the value of the bahn . "
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .
on the other hand , he said growth outside germany would require a major investment . in addition , deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn has so far not set out where the company 's growth was likely to come from , kurz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn agrees to exhibit holocaust photos deutsche bahn , germany 's state-owned national railway , bowed to government appeals on friday and agreed to allow an exhibition on nazi deportations to be shown at train stations across the country .

" on the weekends up to 30,000 people come in almost 200 buses .
the town can barely handle it , but on the other hand it 's nice so many people are interested in the erz mountains ' folk art and that they come right to seiffen to see it . " however , locals say that even with all the visitors , there is no more room for johannes schulte to sell his goods .
schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .
" that 's a lot of money to put somewhere and look at .
i do n't have that kind of money . " but local businessman matthias schalling said most customers realize that many hours of work going into each of the figures . " we have managed to make it clear to customers that it takes a lot of manual work , and that has its price , " he said .
" the customers have come to accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines reichmann said she 's faced verbal abuse for selling imports but until this year , when schulte opened his first shop in seiffen , visitors have n't had much of a choice , as few imported goods were available in town .
now his small store , which advertises " crafts from around the world , " has wooden figures made in the erz mountains - and labeled as such - and other imported figures bearing no label . it 's a difference that schulte 's employees have to deal with every day . " you get insulted in your own shop pretty often , " said tapea helmert , a 23-year-old wooden-toy maker and saleswoman .
" people ask if we 're not ashamed of working here .
it does n't matter to people if we say we 're just happy to have a job .
people just come in , yell at us and then leave . " other people simply stand outside and stare in the windows , helmert and her 22-year-old co-worker ines reichmann said .
the women said they had been told they would " grow slant eyes " for working in a shop that sells imports . mafia-like methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seiffen 's toys are tradtionally handmade thomas kirsche , the man schulte rents the shop from , has also had problems with other locals .
he used to run a shop selling local decorations made by other craftspeople , but this year few people were willing to sell their work in his store when they found out to whom he rented a long-empty shop . " i knew what i was getting into , " kirsche said .
" but that such mafia-like methods would be employed , that neighbors i 've known for 56 years walk past without looking at me or saying hello , of course , i did n't expect that . " at least one hotel has refused to give schulte a room after receiving telephone threats , and the businessman once returned to his car to find the windshield smashed , an incident that was not investigated and which uhlmann said schulte may have even staged for publicity . confronting effects of globalization " well , i 'm not generally against globalization , but there are a few effects of globalization that you have to confront , " uhlamnn said .
" among them are certain cheap copies , wherever they come from , that flood the german market and ultimately destroy german jobs .
in our field , it 's not about selling a painted piece of wood but about a piece of german culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in seiffen is n't quite this harmonious uhlmann added that he was able to convince landlords not to rent to schulte when he first tried to set up shop in the area .
this time though , now that schulte was established , local business had decided to start an ad campaign called " originals not knock-offs . " schulte has decided to take the ad 's organizers to court , as he says being called a forger implies he is a criminal .
seiffen businesspeople have objected to the case but could have to pay up to 250,000 euros if the court finds for schulte . schalling said he knows the ads wo n't be enough in the long term and has decided to register some of his designs with the patent office as well as to expand beyond traditional markets and products as a means of using quality to grow despite the influx of lower priced imports . " i 've been going to a tradeshow in england for awhile now and have developed good contacts there , " he said .

thieves , policemen and taxi-drivers have something in common : they often work long hours over christmas .
each profession , however , understands the spirit of christmas in very different terms . a 31-year-old german had a rude awakening on saturday evening when the police found him asleep in his car at a parking lot off of autobahn 30 in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . there are no rules in germany preventing drivers from taking a nap in their car on a parking lot , unless , of course , they doze off in a puff of smoke and leave packages of hashish and marijuana on the seat next to them . the police had no choice but to wake the driver out of his stoned stupor , search the car and write up a report . but , as the münster police reported on sunday : " after the report was written , the man could go back to sleep . " it has not been reported whether the police officers wished the man happy holidays after ruining his evening nap . everybody loves christmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods obtained at a gunpoint should n't really count as christmas gifts on sunday evening , two german teenagers - who either missed out on the whole christmas message of peace and love this year or got the whole concept of christmas gifts seriously wrong - tried to rob a taxi driver in the western german town of bielefeld . " oh , for christ 's sake , it 's christmas eve , " the taxi driver shouted when one of the two teenagers opened the door and put a gun to his head , demanding money in exchange for life . the 18-year-old and his 16-year-old accomplice did n't know that playing how the grinch did his awful deed can be a dangerous thing .
nobody wants to have their christmas stolen , not even the grownups . it 's a question of perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what , you can count on christmas every year the taxi driver jumped out of the car and nobly fought for his right to work on christmas eve .
the gift extortionist and the gift denier brawled a bit before the thief ran away . " the taxi driver 's resistance and reference to christmas evidently unsettled the bandit , " police spokesman michael mehler said on monday . the two teenagers were eventually arrested , probably wondering - in their own way - whatever happened to the spirit of christmas . but that 's the nice thing about christmas .
there 's always next year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

thieves , policemen and taxi-drivers have something in common : they often work long hours over christmas .
each profession , however , understands the spirit of christmas in very different terms . a 31-year-old german had a rude awakening on saturday evening when the police found him asleep in his car at a parking lot off of autobahn 30 in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . there are no rules in germany preventing drivers from taking a nap in their car on a parking lot , unless , of course , they doze off in a puff of smoke and leave packages of hashish and marijuana on the seat next to them . the police had no choice but to wake the driver out of his stoned stupor , search the car and write up a report . but , as the münster police reported on sunday : " after the report was written , the man could go back to sleep . " it has not been reported whether the police officers wished the man happy holidays after ruining his evening nap . everybody loves christmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods obtained at a gunpoint should n't really count as christmas gifts on sunday evening , two german teenagers - who either missed out on the whole christmas message of peace and love this year or got the whole concept of christmas gifts seriously wrong - tried to rob a taxi driver in the western german town of bielefeld . " oh , for christ 's sake , it 's christmas eve , " the taxi driver shouted when one of the two teenagers opened the door and put a gun to his head , demanding money in exchange for life . the 18-year-old and his 16-year-old accomplice did n't know that playing how the grinch did his awful deed can be a dangerous thing .
nobody wants to have their christmas stolen , not even the grownups . it 's a question of perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what , you can count on christmas every year the taxi driver jumped out of the car and nobly fought for his right to work on christmas eve .
the gift extortionist and the gift denier brawled a bit before the thief ran away . " the taxi driver 's resistance and reference to christmas evidently unsettled the bandit , " police spokesman michael mehler said on monday . the two teenagers were eventually arrested , probably wondering - in their own way - whatever happened to the spirit of christmas . but that 's the nice thing about christmas .

thieves , policemen and taxi-drivers have something in common : they often work long hours over christmas .
each profession , however , understands the spirit of christmas in very different terms . a 31-year-old german had a rude awakening on saturday evening when the police found him asleep in his car at a parking lot off of autobahn 30 in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . there are no rules in germany preventing drivers from taking a nap in their car on a parking lot , unless , of course , they doze off in a puff of smoke and leave packages of hashish and marijuana on the seat next to them . the police had no choice but to wake the driver out of his stoned stupor , search the car and write up a report . but , as the münster police reported on sunday : " after the report was written , the man could go back to sleep . " it has not been reported whether the police officers wished the man happy holidays after ruining his evening nap . everybody loves christmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods obtained at a gunpoint should n't really count as christmas gifts on sunday evening , two german teenagers - who either missed out on the whole christmas message of peace and love this year or got the whole concept of christmas gifts seriously wrong - tried to rob a taxi driver in the western german town of bielefeld . " oh , for christ 's sake , it 's christmas eve , " the taxi driver shouted when one of the two teenagers opened the door and put a gun to his head , demanding money in exchange for life . the 18-year-old and his 16-year-old accomplice did n't know that playing how the grinch did his awful deed can be a dangerous thing .
nobody wants to have their christmas stolen , not even the grownups . it 's a question of perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what , you can count on christmas every year the taxi driver jumped out of the car and nobly fought for his right to work on christmas eve .
the gift extortionist and the gift denier brawled a bit before the thief ran away . " the taxi driver 's resistance and reference to christmas evidently unsettled the bandit , " police spokesman michael mehler said on monday . the two teenagers were eventually arrested , probably wondering - in their own way - whatever happened to the spirit of christmas . but that 's the nice thing about christmas .

" on the weekends up to 30,000 people come in almost 200 buses .
the town can barely handle it , but on the other hand it 's nice so many people are interested in the erz mountains ' folk art and that they come right to seiffen to see it . " however , locals say that even with all the visitors , there is no more room for johannes schulte to sell his goods .
schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .
" that 's a lot of money to put somewhere and look at .
i do n't have that kind of money . " but local businessman matthias schalling said most customers realize that many hours of work going into each of the figures . " we have managed to make it clear to customers that it takes a lot of manual work , and that has its price , " he said .
" the customers have come to accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines reichmann said she 's faced verbal abuse for selling imports but until this year , when schulte opened his first shop in seiffen , visitors have n't had much of a choice , as few imported goods were available in town .
now his small store , which advertises " crafts from around the world , " has wooden figures made in the erz mountains - and labeled as such - and other imported figures bearing no label . it 's a difference that schulte 's employees have to deal with every day . " you get insulted in your own shop pretty often , " said tapea helmert , a 23-year-old wooden-toy maker and saleswoman .
" people ask if we 're not ashamed of working here .
it does n't matter to people if we say we 're just happy to have a job .
people just come in , yell at us and then leave . " other people simply stand outside and stare in the windows , helmert and her 22-year-old co-worker ines reichmann said .
the women said they had been told they would " grow slant eyes " for working in a shop that sells imports . mafia-like methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seiffen 's toys are tradtionally handmade thomas kirsche , the man schulte rents the shop from , has also had problems with other locals .
he used to run a shop selling local decorations made by other craftspeople , but this year few people were willing to sell their work in his store when they found out to whom he rented a long-empty shop . " i knew what i was getting into , " kirsche said .
" but that such mafia-like methods would be employed , that neighbors i 've known for 56 years walk past without looking at me or saying hello , of course , i did n't expect that . " at least one hotel has refused to give schulte a room after receiving telephone threats , and the businessman once returned to his car to find the windshield smashed , an incident that was not investigated and which uhlmann said schulte may have even staged for publicity . confronting effects of globalization " well , i 'm not generally against globalization , but there are a few effects of globalization that you have to confront , " uhlamnn said .
" among them are certain cheap copies , wherever they come from , that flood the german market and ultimately destroy german jobs .
in our field , it 's not about selling a painted piece of wood but about a piece of german culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in seiffen is n't quite this harmonious uhlmann added that he was able to convince landlords not to rent to schulte when he first tried to set up shop in the area .
this time though , now that schulte was established , local business had decided to start an ad campaign called " originals not knock-offs . " schulte has decided to take the ad 's organizers to court , as he says being called a forger implies he is a criminal .
seiffen businesspeople have objected to the case but could have to pay up to 250,000 euros if the court finds for schulte . schalling said he knows the ads wo n't be enough in the long term and has decided to register some of his designs with the patent office as well as to expand beyond traditional markets and products as a means of using quality to grow despite the influx of lower priced imports . " i 've been going to a tradeshow in england for awhile now and have developed good contacts there , " he said .
" we 're also trying to come up with new , high-quality things that people will like and identify with .
that way we can stay a step ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de deutsche bahn -pipe- 25.12.2006 investor group : railway not ready for stock market listing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is n't ready for the big flotation , critics say a leading german investor representative group has roundly criticized berlin 's plans for selling off the nation 's railway company , saying deutsche bahn ag was not ready for a stock market listing . europe 's biggest railways firm , state-owned deutsche bahn ag , is due to make its debut on the stock exchange by 2009 , the country 's last big privatization . but jürgen kurz , a spokesman for the german investor protection group -lrb- dsw -rrb- said deutsche bahn 's efforts at restructuring were coming a little too late and that the process was " not really in hand . " kurz told the dpa news agency in an interview published monday that it was rare that a company 's stock market listing should be delayed as this one has . company managers have unpleasant memories of the autumn of 2004 , when the government and supervisory board broke off preparations for an ipo . bad plan ? after 12 years of reorganization at deutsche bahn , the country 's last big state-owned company , it is clear to the partners in germany 's governing coalition that the time had come for a partial sell-off .
the sticking point , though , is whether the privatised company should own the rail network , including tracks and stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahn chief hartmut mehdorn kurz also said that deutsche bahn 's planned stock-market debut had been hurt by the privatization model selected by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition government .
under legislation which is to be presented to parliament in march , the federal government is to take over the rail tracks and the railway stations . the government 's plan , which was set out in november , calls on deutsche bahn to manage the tracks for a minimum of 10 years and to issue financial reports each year . but , said kurz : " it however , clearly diminishes the value of the bahn . "
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .
on the other hand , he said growth outside germany would require a major investment . in addition , deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn has so far not set out where the company 's growth was likely to come from , kurz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn agrees to exhibit holocaust photos deutsche bahn , germany 's state-owned national railway , bowed to government appeals on friday and agreed to allow an exhibition on nazi deportations to be shown at train stations across the country .

" we all feel a sense of responsibility for germany , ' köhler said in his address , which has been taped but is to be broadcast nationally on monday evening .

" kurz told the dpa news agency in an interview published monday that it was rare that a company 's stock market listing should be delayed as this one has . company managers have unpleasant memories of the autumn of 2004 , when the government and supervisory board broke off preparations for an ipo . bad plan ? after 12 years of reorganization at deutsche bahn , the country 's last big state-owned company , it is clear to the partners in germany 's governing coalition that the time had come for a partial sell-off .
the sticking point , though , is whether the privatised company should own the rail network , including tracks and stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahn chief hartmut mehdorn kurz also said that deutsche bahn 's planned stock-market debut had been hurt by the privatization model selected by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition government .
under legislation which is to be presented to parliament in march , the federal government is to take over the rail tracks and the railway stations . the government 's plan , which was set out in november , calls on deutsche bahn to manage the tracks for a minimum of 10 years and to issue financial reports each year . but , said kurz : " it however , clearly diminishes the value of the bahn . "
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .
on the other hand , he said growth outside germany would require a major investment . in addition , deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn has so far not set out where the company 's growth was likely to come from , kurz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn agrees to exhibit holocaust photos deutsche bahn , germany 's state-owned national railway , bowed to government appeals on friday and agreed to allow an exhibition on nazi deportations to be shown at train stations across the country .

schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .

" on the weekends up to 30,000 people come in almost 200 buses .
the town can barely handle it , but on the other hand it 's nice so many people are interested in the erz mountains ' folk art and that they come right to seiffen to see it . " however , locals say that even with all the visitors , there is no more room for johannes schulte to sell his goods .
schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .
" that 's a lot of money to put somewhere and look at .
i do n't have that kind of money . " but local businessman matthias schalling said most customers realize that many hours of work going into each of the figures . " we have managed to make it clear to customers that it takes a lot of manual work , and that has its price , " he said .
" the customers have come to accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines reichmann said she 's faced verbal abuse for selling imports but until this year , when schulte opened his first shop in seiffen , visitors have n't had much of a choice , as few imported goods were available in town .
now his small store , which advertises " crafts from around the world , " has wooden figures made in the erz mountains - and labeled as such - and other imported figures bearing no label . it 's a difference that schulte 's employees have to deal with every day . " you get insulted in your own shop pretty often , " said tapea helmert , a 23-year-old wooden-toy maker and saleswoman .
" people ask if we 're not ashamed of working here .
it does n't matter to people if we say we 're just happy to have a job .
people just come in , yell at us and then leave . " other people simply stand outside and stare in the windows , helmert and her 22-year-old co-worker ines reichmann said .

thieves , policemen and taxi-drivers have something in common : they often work long hours over christmas .
each profession , however , understands the spirit of christmas in very different terms . a 31-year-old german had a rude awakening on saturday evening when the police found him asleep in his car at a parking lot off of autobahn 30 in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . there are no rules in germany preventing drivers from taking a nap in their car on a parking lot , unless , of course , they doze off in a puff of smoke and leave packages of hashish and marijuana on the seat next to them . the police had no choice but to wake the driver out of his stoned stupor , search the car and write up a report . but , as the münster police reported on sunday : " after the report was written , the man could go back to sleep . " it has not been reported whether the police officers wished the man happy holidays after ruining his evening nap . everybody loves christmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods obtained at a gunpoint should n't really count as christmas gifts on sunday evening , two german teenagers - who either missed out on the whole christmas message of peace and love this year or got the whole concept of christmas gifts seriously wrong - tried to rob a taxi driver in the western german town of bielefeld . " oh , for christ 's sake , it 's christmas eve , " the taxi driver shouted when one of the two teenagers opened the door and put a gun to his head , demanding money in exchange for life . the 18-year-old and his 16-year-old accomplice did n't know that playing how the grinch did his awful deed can be a dangerous thing .
nobody wants to have their christmas stolen , not even the grownups . it 's a question of perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what , you can count on christmas every year the taxi driver jumped out of the car and nobly fought for his right to work on christmas eve .
the gift extortionist and the gift denier brawled a bit before the thief ran away . " the taxi driver 's resistance and reference to christmas evidently unsettled the bandit , " police spokesman michael mehler said on monday . the two teenagers were eventually arrested , probably wondering - in their own way - whatever happened to the spirit of christmas . but that 's the nice thing about christmas .

thieves , policemen and taxi-drivers have something in common : they often work long hours over christmas .

" oh , for christ 's sake , it 's christmas eve , " the taxi driver shouted when one of the two teenagers opened the door and put a gun to his head , demanding money in exchange for life . the 18-year-old and his 16-year-old accomplice did n't know that playing how the grinch did his awful deed can be a dangerous thing .

" kurz told the dpa news agency in an interview published monday that it was rare that a company 's stock market listing should be delayed as this one has . company managers have unpleasant memories of the autumn of 2004 , when the government and supervisory board broke off preparations for an ipo . bad plan ? after 12 years of reorganization at deutsche bahn , the country 's last big state-owned company , it is clear to the partners in germany 's governing coalition that the time had come for a partial sell-off .
the sticking point , though , is whether the privatised company should own the rail network , including tracks and stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahn chief hartmut mehdorn kurz also said that deutsche bahn 's planned stock-market debut had been hurt by the privatization model selected by chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition government .
under legislation which is to be presented to parliament in march , the federal government is to take over the rail tracks and the railway stations . the government 's plan , which was set out in november , calls on deutsche bahn to manage the tracks for a minimum of 10 years and to issue financial reports each year . but , said kurz : " it however , clearly diminishes the value of the bahn . "
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .
on the other hand , he said growth outside germany would require a major investment . in addition , deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn has so far not set out where the company 's growth was likely to come from , kurz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn agrees to exhibit holocaust photos deutsche bahn , germany 's state-owned national railway , bowed to government appeals on friday and agreed to allow an exhibition on nazi deportations to be shown at train stations across the country .

" on the weekends up to 30,000 people come in almost 200 buses .
the town can barely handle it , but on the other hand it 's nice so many people are interested in the erz mountains ' folk art and that they come right to seiffen to see it . " however , locals say that even with all the visitors , there is no more room for johannes schulte to sell his goods .
schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .
" that 's a lot of money to put somewhere and look at .
i do n't have that kind of money . " but local businessman matthias schalling said most customers realize that many hours of work going into each of the figures . " we have managed to make it clear to customers that it takes a lot of manual work , and that has its price , " he said .
" the customers have come to accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines reichmann said she 's faced verbal abuse for selling imports but until this year , when schulte opened his first shop in seiffen , visitors have n't had much of a choice , as few imported goods were available in town .
now his small store , which advertises " crafts from around the world , " has wooden figures made in the erz mountains - and labeled as such - and other imported figures bearing no label . it 's a difference that schulte 's employees have to deal with every day . " you get insulted in your own shop pretty often , " said tapea helmert , a 23-year-old wooden-toy maker and saleswoman .
" people ask if we 're not ashamed of working here .
it does n't matter to people if we say we 're just happy to have a job .
people just come in , yell at us and then leave . " other people simply stand outside and stare in the windows , helmert and her 22-year-old co-worker ines reichmann said .
the women said they had been told they would " grow slant eyes " for working in a shop that sells imports . mafia-like methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seiffen 's toys are tradtionally handmade thomas kirsche , the man schulte rents the shop from , has also had problems with other locals .
he used to run a shop selling local decorations made by other craftspeople , but this year few people were willing to sell their work in his store when they found out to whom he rented a long-empty shop . " i knew what i was getting into , " kirsche said .
" but that such mafia-like methods would be employed , that neighbors i 've known for 56 years walk past without looking at me or saying hello , of course , i did n't expect that . " at least one hotel has refused to give schulte a room after receiving telephone threats , and the businessman once returned to his car to find the windshield smashed , an incident that was not investigated and which uhlmann said schulte may have even staged for publicity . confronting effects of globalization " well , i 'm not generally against globalization , but there are a few effects of globalization that you have to confront , " uhlamnn said .
" among them are certain cheap copies , wherever they come from , that flood the german market and ultimately destroy german jobs .
in our field , it 's not about selling a painted piece of wood but about a piece of german culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in seiffen is n't quite this harmonious uhlmann added that he was able to convince landlords not to rent to schulte when he first tried to set up shop in the area .
this time though , now that schulte was established , local business had decided to start an ad campaign called " originals not knock-offs . " schulte has decided to take the ad 's organizers to court , as he says being called a forger implies he is a criminal .
seiffen businesspeople have objected to the case but could have to pay up to 250,000 euros if the court finds for schulte . schalling said he knows the ads wo n't be enough in the long term and has decided to register some of his designs with the patent office as well as to expand beyond traditional markets and products as a means of using quality to grow despite the influx of lower priced imports . " i 've been going to a tradeshow in england for awhile now and have developed good contacts there , " he said .
" we 're also trying to come up with new , high-quality things that people will like and identify with .
that way we can stay a step ahead .

" on the weekends up to 30,000 people come in almost 200 buses .
the town can barely handle it , but on the other hand it 's nice so many people are interested in the erz mountains ' folk art and that they come right to seiffen to see it . " however , locals say that even with all the visitors , there is no more room for johannes schulte to sell his goods .
schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .
" that 's a lot of money to put somewhere and look at .
i do n't have that kind of money . " but local businessman matthias schalling said most customers realize that many hours of work going into each of the figures . " we have managed to make it clear to customers that it takes a lot of manual work , and that has its price , " he said .
" the customers have come to accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines reichmann said she 's faced verbal abuse for selling imports but until this year , when schulte opened his first shop in seiffen , visitors have n't had much of a choice , as few imported goods were available in town .
now his small store , which advertises " crafts from around the world , " has wooden figures made in the erz mountains - and labeled as such - and other imported figures bearing no label . it 's a difference that schulte 's employees have to deal with every day . " you get insulted in your own shop pretty often , " said tapea helmert , a 23-year-old wooden-toy maker and saleswoman .
" people ask if we 're not ashamed of working here .
it does n't matter to people if we say we 're just happy to have a job .
people just come in , yell at us and then leave . " other people simply stand outside and stare in the windows , helmert and her 22-year-old co-worker ines reichmann said .

thieves , policemen and taxi-drivers have something in common : they often work long hours over christmas .
each profession , however , understands the spirit of christmas in very different terms . a 31-year-old german had a rude awakening on saturday evening when the police found him asleep in his car at a parking lot off of autobahn 30 in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . there are no rules in germany preventing drivers from taking a nap in their car on a parking lot , unless , of course , they doze off in a puff of smoke and leave packages of hashish and marijuana on the seat next to them . the police had no choice but to wake the driver out of his stoned stupor , search the car and write up a report . but , as the münster police reported on sunday : " after the report was written , the man could go back to sleep . " it has not been reported whether the police officers wished the man happy holidays after ruining his evening nap . everybody loves christmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods obtained at a gunpoint should n't really count as christmas gifts on sunday evening , two german teenagers - who either missed out on the whole christmas message of peace and love this year or got the whole concept of christmas gifts seriously wrong - tried to rob a taxi driver in the western german town of bielefeld . " oh , for christ 's sake , it 's christmas eve , " the taxi driver shouted when one of the two teenagers opened the door and put a gun to his head , demanding money in exchange for life . the 18-year-old and his 16-year-old accomplice did n't know that playing how the grinch did his awful deed can be a dangerous thing .
nobody wants to have their christmas stolen , not even the grownups . it 's a question of perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what , you can count on christmas every year the taxi driver jumped out of the car and nobly fought for his right to work on christmas eve .
the gift extortionist and the gift denier brawled a bit before the thief ran away . " the taxi driver 's resistance and reference to christmas evidently unsettled the bandit , " police spokesman michael mehler said on monday . the two teenagers were eventually arrested , probably wondering - in their own way - whatever happened to the spirit of christmas . but that 's the nice thing about christmas .

thieves , policemen and taxi-drivers have something in common : they often work long hours over christmas .
each profession , however , understands the spirit of christmas in very different terms . a 31-year-old german had a rude awakening on saturday evening when the police found him asleep in his car at a parking lot off of autobahn 30 in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . there are no rules in germany preventing drivers from taking a nap in their car on a parking lot , unless , of course , they doze off in a puff of smoke and leave packages of hashish and marijuana on the seat next to them . the police had no choice but to wake the driver out of his stoned stupor , search the car and write up a report . but , as the münster police reported on sunday : " after the report was written , the man could go back to sleep . " it has not been reported whether the police officers wished the man happy holidays after ruining his evening nap . everybody loves christmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods obtained at a gunpoint should n't really count as christmas gifts on sunday evening , two german teenagers - who either missed out on the whole christmas message of peace and love this year or got the whole concept of christmas gifts seriously wrong - tried to rob a taxi driver in the western german town of bielefeld . " oh , for christ 's sake , it 's christmas eve , " the taxi driver shouted when one of the two teenagers opened the door and put a gun to his head , demanding money in exchange for life . the 18-year-old and his 16-year-old accomplice did n't know that playing how the grinch did his awful deed can be a dangerous thing .
nobody wants to have their christmas stolen , not even the grownups . it 's a question of perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter what , you can count on christmas every year the taxi driver jumped out of the car and nobly fought for his right to work on christmas eve .
the gift extortionist and the gift denier brawled a bit before the thief ran away . " the taxi driver 's resistance and reference to christmas evidently unsettled the bandit , " police spokesman michael mehler said on monday . the two teenagers were eventually arrested , probably wondering - in their own way - whatever happened to the spirit of christmas . but that 's the nice thing about christmas .

"
as a result , he said , the proceeds from the bahn 's stock exchange listing will be correspondingly smaller . from the point of view of future investors , kurz said , it would make more sense to list the company as a total unit on the stock exchange , as was the case with the german post office , deutsche post ag , and the nation 's giant telephone company , deutsche telekom ag , both of which have been listed on the stock market . moreover , kurz said the tough price competition with airlines would check growth in deutsche bahn 's domestic german market .

" on the weekends up to 30,000 people come in almost 200 buses .
the town can barely handle it , but on the other hand it 's nice so many people are interested in the erz mountains ' folk art and that they come right to seiffen to see it . " however , locals say that even with all the visitors , there is no more room for johannes schulte to sell his goods .
schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .
" that 's a lot of money to put somewhere and look at .
i do n't have that kind of money . " but local businessman matthias schalling said most customers realize that many hours of work going into each of the figures . " we have managed to make it clear to customers that it takes a lot of manual work , and that has its price , " he said .
" the customers have come to accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines reichmann said she 's faced verbal abuse for selling imports but until this year , when schulte opened his first shop in seiffen , visitors have n't had much of a choice , as few imported goods were available in town .
now his small store , which advertises " crafts from around the world , " has wooden figures made in the erz mountains - and labeled as such - and other imported figures bearing no label . it 's a difference that schulte 's employees have to deal with every day . " you get insulted in your own shop pretty often , " said tapea helmert , a 23-year-old wooden-toy maker and saleswoman .
" people ask if we 're not ashamed of working here .
it does n't matter to people if we say we 're just happy to have a job .
people just come in , yell at us and then leave . " other people simply stand outside and stare in the windows , helmert and her 22-year-old co-worker ines reichmann said .
the women said they had been told they would " grow slant eyes " for working in a shop that sells imports . mafia-like methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seiffen 's toys are tradtionally handmade thomas kirsche , the man schulte rents the shop from , has also had problems with other locals .
he used to run a shop selling local decorations made by other craftspeople , but this year few people were willing to sell their work in his store when they found out to whom he rented a long-empty shop . " i knew what i was getting into , " kirsche said .
" but that such mafia-like methods would be employed , that neighbors i 've known for 56 years walk past without looking at me or saying hello , of course , i did n't expect that . " at least one hotel has refused to give schulte a room after receiving telephone threats , and the businessman once returned to his car to find the windshield smashed , an incident that was not investigated and which uhlmann said schulte may have even staged for publicity . confronting effects of globalization " well , i 'm not generally against globalization , but there are a few effects of globalization that you have to confront , " uhlamnn said .
" among them are certain cheap copies , wherever they come from , that flood the german market and ultimately destroy german jobs .
in our field , it 's not about selling a painted piece of wood but about a piece of german culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in seiffen is n't quite this harmonious uhlmann added that he was able to convince landlords not to rent to schulte when he first tried to set up shop in the area .
this time though , now that schulte was established , local business had decided to start an ad campaign called " originals not knock-offs . " schulte has decided to take the ad 's organizers to court , as he says being called a forger implies he is a criminal .
seiffen businesspeople have objected to the case but could have to pay up to 250,000 euros if the court finds for schulte . schalling said he knows the ads wo n't be enough in the long term and has decided to register some of his designs with the patent office as well as to expand beyond traditional markets and products as a means of using quality to grow despite the influx of lower priced imports . " i 've been going to a tradeshow in england for awhile now and have developed good contacts there , " he said .
" we 're also trying to come up with new , high-quality things that people will like and identify with .
that way we can stay a step ahead .

" on the weekends up to 30,000 people come in almost 200 buses .
the town can barely handle it , but on the other hand it 's nice so many people are interested in the erz mountains ' folk art and that they come right to seiffen to see it . " however , locals say that even with all the visitors , there is no more room for johannes schulte to sell his goods .
schulte employed 300 workers in china to manufacture the wooden figurines , which he sells for about half the price of the handmade versions . the price of an erz original " i had a look at one of the little wooden men , it cost 140 euros -lrb- $ 183 -rrb- , " one tourist said of a handmade decoration .
" that 's a lot of money to put somewhere and look at .
i do n't have that kind of money . " but local businessman matthias schalling said most customers realize that many hours of work going into each of the figures . " we have managed to make it clear to customers that it takes a lot of manual work , and that has its price , " he said .
" the customers have come to accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines reichmann said she 's faced verbal abuse for selling imports but until this year , when schulte opened his first shop in seiffen , visitors have n't had much of a choice , as few imported goods were available in town .
now his small store , which advertises " crafts from around the world , " has wooden figures made in the erz mountains - and labeled as such - and other imported figures bearing no label . it 's a difference that schulte 's employees have to deal with every day . " you get insulted in your own shop pretty often , " said tapea helmert , a 23-year-old wooden-toy maker and saleswoman .
" people ask if we 're not ashamed of working here .
it does n't matter to people if we say we 're just happy to have a job .
people just come in , yell at us and then leave . " other people simply stand outside and stare in the windows , helmert and her 22-year-old co-worker ines reichmann said .
the women said they had been told they would " grow slant eyes " for working in a shop that sells imports . mafia-like methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seiffen 's toys are tradtionally handmade thomas kirsche , the man schulte rents the shop from , has also had problems with other locals .
he used to run a shop selling local decorations made by other craftspeople , but this year few people were willing to sell their work in his store when they found out to whom he rented a long-empty shop . " i knew what i was getting into , " kirsche said .
" but that such mafia-like methods would be employed , that neighbors i 've known for 56 years walk past without looking at me or saying hello , of course , i did n't expect that . " at least one hotel has refused to give schulte a room after receiving telephone threats , and the businessman once returned to his car to find the windshield smashed , an incident that was not investigated and which uhlmann said schulte may have even staged for publicity . confronting effects of globalization " well , i 'm not generally against globalization , but there are a few effects of globalization that you have to confront , " uhlamnn said .
" among them are certain cheap copies , wherever they come from , that flood the german market and ultimately destroy german jobs .
in our field , it 's not about selling a painted piece of wood but about a piece of german culture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in seiffen is n't quite this harmonious uhlmann added that he was able to convince landlords not to rent to schulte when he first tried to set up shop in the area .

there have been several bomb and grenade attacks - killing more than 20 people - in guwahati since september .
officials say militants of the united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- were likely to be behind the attack .
the separatist group had been fighting delhi 's rule in the tea and oil-rich state for the past 27 years .
we apprehend a surge in rebel violence khagen sarmah , assam intelligence chief the proposal to deploy the army came up on sunday during a meeting of the unified command , a body that includes representatives of the state administration and the police , the army and the federal para-military forces active in assam .
the unified command was formed in the late 1990s to coordinate counter-insurgency operations in assam , a model later replicated in the troubled northern state of kashmir .
though the army is deployed in most districts of assam affected by separatist violence , the security of the state capital , guwahati , has so far been handled by the assam police .
" but there has been a series of explosions in guwahati -lrb- ... -rrb- and there 's a feeling that there could be more trouble in days to come , " said assam police intelligence chief khagen sarmah .
doubts mr sarmah blamed the ulfa for bomb explosions in the state since peace talks collapsed in september and operations against the rebels resumed .
the ulfa has called for a boycott of the indian national games due in assam in february .
the group also called for boycott of indian republic day celebrations on 26 january .
" we apprehend a surge in rebel violence ahead of these events , " said mr sarmah .
but opinion is divided on whether deploying the army would help curb the violence .
correspondents say the troops deployments in guwahati is likely to be opposed by assamese human rights groups and regional political parties who have been calling for the resumption of peace talks and an end to military operations .

after years of more misses than hits , the mumbai -based industry has performed exceedingly well this year .
among the hits of 2006 have been such movies as rang de basanti , a coming-of-age film which struck a chord despite a naive and violent climax ; lage raho munnabhai , a breezy comedy which resurrects the spirit of mahatma gandhi in fighting a sclerotic and corrupt system ; and krrish , an out-and out indian superhero biopic .
' new experience ' then there was the slick action-packed hit heist sequel tale , dhoom 2 with its muscled and toned stars , and fanaa on doomed love .
blockbusters dhoom 2 : has earned over $ 14.5m on a budget of $ 5.6m krrish : has earned nearly $ 12m on a budget of $ 5.6m lage raho munnabhai - has earned $ 11.6m on a budget of $ 3.3m fanaa - has earned $ 10.5m on a budget of $ 4.5m vivaah - has earned $ 4.5m on a budget of $ 1.5mn source : film information the most heart-warming development was the success of low-budget movies like khosla ka ghosla , an engrossing take on the shenanigans of unscrupulous realtors in urban india .
film critic indu mirani feels that after years of confusion , film-makers have figured out what the audiences want today .
" they want a new experience .
so whatever films they make , the directors are wanting to give the audiences something fresh , " he says .
that is not easy for an industry which has spent decades regurgitating the same lost-and-found , song-and-dance stories or lifting from hollywood .
bollywood trade analyst komal nahta says the directors have finally realised the value for a good script .
" they realised that scripts are the backbone of good cinema , " he says .
and filmmaker rakesh roshan , who made krrish , said the cineplex explosion in urban india had made " educated people " return to the theatres .
bollywood insiders echo roshan 's sentiments and say the cineplex has altered indian film-going habits and bollywood economics .
earlier , single screen theatres would require at least 800 to 1000 people for a show to be a commercially successful and help the movie to break even .
at a typical five-screen cineplex , in contrast , each theatre needs only about 200 people to make it a full house .
cineplex ticket prices are usually three times more than the single-screen cinema tickets , but audiences still prefer them for their comforts and good projection and sound .
the result is that bollywood is laughing all the way to the bank .
diaspora fortunes adding to their fortunes is the bollywood-crazy diaspora market , especially in the uk and north america , where films have been faring well in the past few years .
there have been films which have flopped resoundingly at home only to be lapped up by diaspora audiences .
take for example , kabhi alvida na kehna , a creaky infidelity tale starring top stars , that sank after an impressive opening at the cinemas in india , but went on to mop up massive earnings overseas .
it is simple economics , experts say .
a bollywood movie ticket in uk , they say , typically sells at £ 10 , or 800 indian rupees .
that is the price of four tickets for one overseas .
also , bollywood has discovered that moolah can be finally made in franchising their films through video games , clothing lines , music ring tones , and mobile movie clips .
" bollywood music and clips brings us a big chunk of revenue from our non-voice services , " says harish gandhi of airtel , one of india 's biggest mobile telephone companies .
all this is emboldening directors to take some risks and make different movies .
" films made on reasonable budgets and original scripts are working because producers are willing to take risks , " says indu mirani .
there is no reason why bollywood should stop celebrating this welcome development in 2007 .

blockbusters dhoom 2 : has earned over $ 14.5m on a budget of $ 5.6m krrish : has earned nearly $ 12m on a budget of $ 5.6m lage raho munnabhai - has earned $ 11.6m on a budget of $ 3.3m fanaa - has earned $ 10.5m on a budget of $ 4.5m vivaah - has earned $ 4.5m on a budget of $ 1.5mn source : film information the most heart-warming development was the success of low-budget movies like khosla ka ghosla , an engrossing take on the shenanigans of unscrupulous realtors in urban india .
film critic indu mirani feels that after years of confusion , film-makers have figured out what the audiences want today .
" they want a new experience .
so whatever films they make , the directors are wanting to give the audiences something fresh , " he says .
that is not easy for an industry which has spent decades regurgitating the same lost-and-found , song-and-dance stories or lifting from hollywood .
bollywood trade analyst komal nahta says the directors have finally realised the value for a good script .
" they realised that scripts are the backbone of good cinema , " he says .
dhoom 2 had action by muscled and toned stars and filmmaker rakesh roshan , who made krrish , said the cineplex explosion in urban india had made " educated people " return to the theatres .
bollywood insiders echo roshan 's sentiments and say the cineplex has altered indian film-going habits and bollywood economics .
earlier , single screen theatres would require at least 800 to 1000 people for a show to be a commercially successful and help the movie to break even .
at a typical five-screen cineplex , in contrast , each theatre needs only about 200 people to make it a full house .
cineplex ticket prices are usually three times more than the single-screen cinema tickets , but audiences still prefer them for their comforts and good projection and sound .
the result is that bollywood is laughing all the way to the bank .
diaspora fortunes adding to their fortunes is the bollywood-crazy diaspora market , especially in the uk and north america , where films have been faring well in the past few years .
there have been films which have flopped resoundingly at home only to be lapped up by diaspora audiences .
take for example , kabhi alvida na kehna , a creaky infidelity tale starring top stars , that sank after an impressive opening at the cinemas in india , but went on to mop up massive earnings overseas .
it is simple economics , experts say .
a bollywood movie ticket in uk , they say , typically sells at £ 10 , or 800 indian rupees .
that is the price of four tickets for one overseas .
khosla ka ghosla looked at the gullible middle-class indian also , bollywood has discovered that moolah can be finally made in franchising their films through video games , clothing lines , music ring tones , and mobile movie clips .
" bollywood music and clips brings us a big chunk of revenue from our non-voice services , " says harish gandhi of airtel , one of india 's biggest mobile telephone companies .
all this is emboldening directors to take some risks and make different movies .
" films made on reasonable budgets and original scripts are working because producers are willing to take risks , " says indu mirani .
there is no reason why bollywood should stop celebrating this welcome development in 2007 .
