there 's just one problem : the newly renovated theater is n't safe for the public yet . in honor of bertolt brecht year , one of his most famous play 's - " the three penny opera " - is scheduled to open friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast . hasty renovations , under the auspices of entrepreneur falk walter , came down to the wire and the city gave its final approval for public use thursday , one day before the premiere . fire safety issues such as emergency exit signs and smoke alarms were the major concerns . producer klaus maria brandauer and his crew may be used to a little drama - after all , that 's their job - but they can certainly breathe a bit easier now knowing that the audience will be allowed to take a sit for friday 's performance . brecht 's beggars satirize weimar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this inside looks good - it 's the foyer that 's unfinished " people tell us that they want to get unemployment down to three or four million - or even half of what it is now - and then they ask us why we 're performing this piece , " brandauer told german public tv broadcaster 's " titel , thesen , temperamente " program . the work , which premiered in berlin in 1928 , is a pointed satire of capitalist society .
brecht , who moved to east germany after living in exile during world war ii , was known for his socialist leanings and politicized plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1940 , germany was at war and there was no gdr in a twist of irony , the founding of the sed , former east germany 's governing socialist party , took place in the admiralspalast in 1955 .
brecht had been a member of the german communist party -lrb- kpd -rrb- , the forerunner to the sed .
he did not officially join the sed , though the former east german government attempted to glorify his work for their purposes . " the three penny opera , " a tale of beggars , prostitutes and thieves in london 's soho district in the 1920s , depicts the darker side of big city life .
though set in england , brecht was actually criticizing bourgeois-capitalism in germany 's weimar republic -lrb- 1913-1933 -rrb- . frustration with poverty was , apparently , not a 20th century phenomenon : brecht based the play on the 1728 " beggar 's opera " by john gray -lrb- text -rrb- and johann christoph pepusch -lrb- music -rrb- . rock star takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock star campino knows the stage but is new to theater campino , the 44-year-old lead singer of the german punk rock band " die toten hosen , " will make his theater debut in the lead role , mack the knife . elements of jazz and lighter entertainment music come through in kurt weill 's score to " the three penny opera . "
sacred and operatic melodies can also be heard .
in any case , the role will be a test of campino 's versatility as a musician , not to mention his acting skills . in yet another case of irony , the admiralspalast production of the anti-capitalist theatre piece is not subsidized by the german government but has received private sponsorship from deutsche bank . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamour will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 10.08.2006 should germany send peacekeepers to lebanon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far germany has made no decision dw-world.de readers sounded off on whether germany should send troops to lebanon as part of a possible un peacekeeping force in the current conflict between israel , lebanon and the hezbollah . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . one can only imagine the reaction of the world press should it become necessary for german soldiers to fire on israeli forces .
additionally , the temptation for israelis to damage german troops will be an opportunity too great for them to resist .
rather , germany 's role should be to insist on an end to the slaughter and its leaders should sternly call for a halt to israeli barbarities . - michael davis the israeli army is being used by the usa as a military arm of the us forces .
so it would do no good for german troops to get involved because the usa is in control and will do whatever it wants to do in the middle east and what it wants is to get all that oil for the usa . - james wilder , usa please do not send german soldiers to lebanon ; it is very dangerous and they could be bombarded by israel like the canadian at the un post .
do not trust them .
remember the uss ' liberty ' ship in the mediterranean sea in 1967 ?
how many american soldiers were slaughtered ? 34 and 171 wounded .
so please save the young soldiers .
it is not worth it to die helping the bad cause . - agatha king , toronto , canada nazi germany is still too present in the minds of the israeli people and would only be relived by the soldiers ' presence . - helga anderson , toronto , canada of course they should be sent .
then we can see if the german government is really truthful when it says all must be done to support israel , as it now says 60 years after the fact .
german soldiers should be dying to protect israel - that shows real support . - ernst stetz the german people are right to avoid entanglement in the current israeli / lebanese conflict .
the prospect of german troops having to fire on either side is unacceptable , as is prime minister olmert 's recent request for australian troops to be sent to this grossly uneven conflict .
germans and australians would be well advised to remain outside the conflict and to implement policies which are fair to both combatants . - michael arthur vaughan , australia as much as i feel that the eu should be backing off when it comes to israel , i 'm stunned that olmert would seriously consider germany as a peacekeeping force in southern lebanon .
if germany feels that it will be a backlash towards its muslim and arabic population , then that basically means that you care more about appeasing and promoting terrorism and the destruction of israel , and that you have fear towards your muslim and arabic populations . - lavalore as a person of german descent , i believe germany should stay neutral .
israel is a country with too many problems .
let the french get involved , give them the " honor " to feel important .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : celebrating bertolt brecht " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " a communist in a city of angels bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin brandauer 's betrayal of brecht culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.08.2006 berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show must go on bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .
there 's just one problem : the newly renovated theater is n't safe for the public yet . in honor of bertolt brecht year , one of his most famous play 's - " the three penny opera " - is scheduled to open friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast . hasty renovations , under the auspices of entrepreneur falk walter , came down to the wire and the city gave its final approval for public use thursday , one day before the premiere . fire safety issues such as emergency exit signs and smoke alarms were the major concerns . producer klaus maria brandauer and his crew may be used to a little drama - after all , that 's their job - but they can certainly breathe a bit easier now knowing that the audience will be allowed to take a sit for friday 's performance . brecht 's beggars satirize weimar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this inside looks good - it 's the foyer that 's unfinished " people tell us that they want to get unemployment down to three or four million - or even half of what it is now - and then they ask us why we 're performing this piece , " brandauer told german public tv broadcaster 's " titel , thesen , temperamente " program . the work , which premiered in berlin in 1928 , is a pointed satire of capitalist society .
brecht , who moved to east germany after living in exile during world war ii , was known for his socialist leanings and politicized plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1940 , germany was at war and there was no gdr in a twist of irony , the founding of the sed , former east germany 's governing socialist party , took place in the admiralspalast in 1955 .
brecht had been a member of the german communist party -lrb- kpd -rrb- , the forerunner to the sed .
he did not officially join the sed , though the former east german government attempted to glorify his work for their purposes . " the three penny opera , " a tale of beggars , prostitutes and thieves in london 's soho district in the 1920s , depicts the darker side of big city life .
though set in england , brecht was actually criticizing bourgeois-capitalism in germany 's weimar republic -lrb- 1913-1933 -rrb- . frustration with poverty was , apparently , not a 20th century phenomenon : brecht based the play on the 1728 " beggar 's opera " by john gray -lrb- text -rrb- and johann christoph pepusch -lrb- music -rrb- . rock star takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock star campino knows the stage but is new to theater campino , the 44-year-old lead singer of the german punk rock band " die toten hosen , " will make his theater debut in the lead role , mack the knife . elements of jazz and lighter entertainment music come through in kurt weill 's score to " the three penny opera . "
sacred and operatic melodies can also be heard .
in any case , the role will be a test of campino 's versatility as a musician , not to mention his acting skills . in yet another case of irony , the admiralspalast production of the anti-capitalist theatre piece is not subsidized by the german government but has received private sponsorship from deutsche bank . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamour will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . one can only imagine the reaction of the world press should it become necessary for german soldiers to fire on israeli forces .
additionally , the temptation for israelis to damage german troops will be an opportunity too great for them to resist .
rather , germany 's role should be to insist on an end to the slaughter and its leaders should sternly call for a halt to israeli barbarities . - michael davis the israeli army is being used by the usa as a military arm of the us forces .
so it would do no good for german troops to get involved because the usa is in control and will do whatever it wants to do in the middle east and what it wants is to get all that oil for the usa . - james wilder , usa please do not send german soldiers to lebanon ; it is very dangerous and they could be bombarded by israel like the canadian at the un post .
do not trust them .
remember the uss ' liberty ' ship in the mediterranean sea in 1967 ?
how many american soldiers were slaughtered ? 34 and 171 wounded .
so please save the young soldiers .
it is not worth it to die helping the bad cause . - agatha king , toronto , canada nazi germany is still too present in the minds of the israeli people and would only be relived by the soldiers ' presence . - helga anderson , toronto , canada of course they should be sent .
then we can see if the german government is really truthful when it says all must be done to support israel , as it now says 60 years after the fact .
german soldiers should be dying to protect israel - that shows real support . - ernst stetz the german people are right to avoid entanglement in the current israeli / lebanese conflict .
the prospect of german troops having to fire on either side is unacceptable , as is prime minister olmert 's recent request for australian troops to be sent to this grossly uneven conflict .
germans and australians would be well advised to remain outside the conflict and to implement policies which are fair to both combatants . - michael arthur vaughan , australia as much as i feel that the eu should be backing off when it comes to israel , i 'm stunned that olmert would seriously consider germany as a peacekeeping force in southern lebanon .
if germany feels that it will be a backlash towards its muslim and arabic population , then that basically means that you care more about appeasing and promoting terrorism and the destruction of israel , and that you have fear towards your muslim and arabic populations . - lavalore as a person of german descent , i believe germany should stay neutral .
israel is a country with too many problems .
let the french get involved , give them the " honor " to feel important .
why should german soldiers get hurt in a conflict with no good ending in sight ? - nicole complied by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .
in beirut , the government offered to deploy lebanese troops in the south , and in jerusalem , the plans to expand the israeli offensive were put on hold .

" that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd . " excelle n ce as competitive adva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans keep shipping their products overseas germany 's labor costs are on par with those of its trading partners and competitors , horn said , adding that one must also look at a country 's productivity . " germany is a leader in exports , " jung said .
" that would not be possible if labor costs were too high here . " the iw 's schröder begged to differ . " high labor costs do indeed put a country or business region under pressure , " he said .
" many companies manufacture elsewhere .
german businesses must try to balance it out by offering top-quality products and high-precision technology tailored to the needs of their customers .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .
in beirut , the government offered to deploy lebanese troops in the south , and in jerusalem , the plans to expand the israeli offensive were put on hold .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .
in beirut , the government offered to deploy lebanese troops in the south , and in jerusalem , the plans to expand the israeli offensive were put on hold .
a tiny window of hope has opened , but it could slam shut again at any moment . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans mull suspending arms deliveries to israel amid conflict members of germany 's opposition are calling for a suspension of arms deliveries to israel until the end of the current conflict .

" we were the better team for most of the match but just needed the goal , " lamented hamburg coach thomas doll .
" however we are good away from home too so all is not lost and we have to go there believing we can win the match and qualify . " belgian international defender vincent kompany , an eight million euro summer signing from anderlecht , hit the crossbar in the third minute after the ball came off his shoulder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's david jarolim in action last night peruvian international striker paolo guerrero then went close again for hamburg in an encouraging opening quarter hour . " we had so many chances it was incredible we did not score , " said kompany .
" we had no luck tonight but hopefully we will do in spain and if we can keep it tight at the back again we can go through . " osasuna , fourth in the spanish top-flight last season , had their first opening in the 23rd minute when roberto soldado blasted a shot at sascha kirschstein 's legs . the spanish visitors then had the ball in the net through veteran striker savo milosevic four minutes from the interval but the effort was ruled out for offside . two minutes into the second half ivory coast attacker boubacar sanogo missed a glorious chance to put hamburg ahead from just five yards . serbia international milosevic , who has over 100 caps for his country , then missed a sitter for osasuna on the hour fluffing his left-footed shot meters from the goal line . the misses contributed to a scoreless draw which osasuna will certainly be happier with . tie " evenly poised " for return leg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honors even : hsv will have to do it all again in spain " i think it is evenly poised as hamburg are strong away from home , " said osasuna coach angel ziganda .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .

while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel .

germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea .

exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .

exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .
as early as 1964 , german patrol boats and used tanks were sent to israel .
in 1991 , german patriot anti missile defense systems protected the israeli population against iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's scud missiles .
while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel . " in the interest of israeli security and the security of its citizens and for moral and historical reasons , we will help , " then chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time . deliveri n g weapo n s parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli helicopters use german technology but the delivery of complete arms systems has been the exception .
germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea . " co n cer n s about use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli tank in the west bank town of nablus in 2001 but germany also rejects delivery requests for some weapons systems because they could be used against palestinians . " israel does n't get weapons that could obviously be used to combat palestinian rioters , " nassauer said , adding that israel has unsuccessfully tried to get an armed vehicle called dingo , which can be used in densely populated areas to transport soldiers safely .
israel wants 103 vehicles . " but at the end of june , the government approved the delivery of a test dingo , " nassauer said , adding that german governments have a history of arguing that it 's in germany 's interest to deliver weapons to israel . " israel gets much , much more than most other countries , " nassauer said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : german firms involved in illegal arms exports to iran even as tensions simmer between iran and the west over teheran 's nuclear program , security sources in germany say around 100 dummy firms are illegally exporting arms to the islamic country .

"
police arrested 21 people in the uk as the incident once again raised questions about the level of threat europe faces from terrorism since the september 2001 attacks in new york and washington .
" this is certainly not just a british problem , but affects all europeans who are grappling with the problem of homegrown terrorism , " said berndt georg thamm , an expert on terrorism . not the only attack foiled ? " reality has caught up with us after the world cup , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union . -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" whether it 's the two bombs found in dortmund and koblenz on the rail network -lrb- earlier this month -rrb- or the current attack in england , it shows that there 's a constant latent threat , " janssen said .
" we ca n't afford to lower our guard . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flights in britain were grounded for most of the day on thursday others point out that the current incident is by no means an isolated one . " the media always seizes on the attacks that have already happened - sept .
11 , madrid , london , " said david schiller , a terrorism expert .
" but let 's not forget that , every year since sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorists have planned at least one attack or series of attacks in europe per year which have been foiled .
these things do n't make it into the press . " the handiwork of al qaeda ? though britain has n't released details on the identity of those arrested , experts say the nature of the alleged plot suggests a connection to al qaeda . " in the last two months al qaeda promised that it would avenge iraq and afghanistan by attacking british and american aviation assets - i see a direct link with that , " terrorism expert paul beaver told news agency reuters . all signs pointed to al qaeda planning a strike to coincide with the upcoming fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , schiller said .
" the organization is known for its penchant for symbolism and date-specific campaigns , " he said .
" and al qaeda is also known to target economic infrastructure , whether it 's tourism or aviation . " thamm also saw a link between the foiled plot and al qaeda , and he stressed that germany was n't immune to attacks . " it would be fatal for germany to think we are in a special position because we did n't participate in the war against iraq , " thamm said , pointing out that germany had 2,800 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
" black , red , gold really is n't a bullet-proof vest anymore .

" as long as the events in london are still under investigation , we should n't start talking about further consequences , " he told the netzeitung . months-long operation the british plot was uncovered after a joint operation by scotland yard 's anti-terrorist branch and the security services that lasted several months , london 's metropolitan police said . the heightened security alert comes 13 months after four british islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people and injured about 700 on london 's transport network . last month , al qaeda called on muslims to fight those who backed israel 's attacks on lebanon and warned of more attacks unless us and british forces pulled out of iraq and afghanistan . independent terrorism expert paul beaver said that the nature of the suspected plot suggested a connection to al qaeda .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 10.08.2006 should germany send peacekeepers to lebanon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far germany has made no decision dw-world.de readers sounded off on whether germany should send troops to lebanon as part of a possible un peacekeeping force in the current conflict between israel , lebanon and the hezbollah . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . one can only imagine the reaction of the world press should it become necessary for german soldiers to fire on israeli forces .
additionally , the temptation for israelis to damage german troops will be an opportunity too great for them to resist .
rather , germany 's role should be to insist on an end to the slaughter and its leaders should sternly call for a halt to israeli barbarities . - michael davis the israeli army is being used by the usa as a military arm of the us forces .
so it would do no good for german troops to get involved because the usa is in control and will do whatever it wants to do in the middle east and what it wants is to get all that oil for the usa . - james wilder , usa please do not send german soldiers to lebanon ; it is very dangerous and they could be bombarded by israel like the canadian at the un post .
do not trust them .
remember the uss ' liberty ' ship in the mediterranean sea in 1967 ?
how many american soldiers were slaughtered ? 34 and 171 wounded .
so please save the young soldiers .
it is not worth it to die helping the bad cause . - agatha king , toronto , canada nazi germany is still too present in the minds of the israeli people and would only be relived by the soldiers ' presence . - helga anderson , toronto , canada of course they should be sent .
then we can see if the german government is really truthful when it says all must be done to support israel , as it now says 60 years after the fact .
german soldiers should be dying to protect israel - that shows real support . - ernst stetz the german people are right to avoid entanglement in the current israeli / lebanese conflict .
the prospect of german troops having to fire on either side is unacceptable , as is prime minister olmert 's recent request for australian troops to be sent to this grossly uneven conflict .
germans and australians would be well advised to remain outside the conflict and to implement policies which are fair to both combatants . - michael arthur vaughan , australia as much as i feel that the eu should be backing off when it comes to israel , i 'm stunned that olmert would seriously consider germany as a peacekeeping force in southern lebanon .
if germany feels that it will be a backlash towards its muslim and arabic population , then that basically means that you care more about appeasing and promoting terrorism and the destruction of israel , and that you have fear towards your muslim and arabic populations . - lavalore as a person of german descent , i believe germany should stay neutral .
israel is a country with too many problems .
let the french get involved , give them the " honor " to feel important .
why should german soldiers get hurt in a conflict with no good ending in sight ? - nicole complied by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .
-lrb- aug .
3 , 2006 -rrb- merkel skeptical about sending german troops to middle east german chancellor angela merkel has said in an interview that at the present time she does not support the idea of german troops being part of a peacekeeping contingent in lebanon .
-lrb- aug .
29 , 2006 -rrb- violence in the middle east read dw-world.de 's dossier on the escalating violence in the middle east and the search for peace .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .
as early as 1964 , german patrol boats and used tanks were sent to israel .
in 1991 , german patriot anti missile defense systems protected the israeli population against iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's scud missiles .
while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel . " in the interest of israeli security and the security of its citizens and for moral and historical reasons , we will help , " then chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time . deliveri n g weapo n s parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli helicopters use german technology but the delivery of complete arms systems has been the exception .
germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea . " co n cer n s about use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli tank in the west bank town of nablus in 2001 but germany also rejects delivery requests for some weapons systems because they could be used against palestinians . " israel does n't get weapons that could obviously be used to combat palestinian rioters , " nassauer said , adding that israel has unsuccessfully tried to get an armed vehicle called dingo , which can be used in densely populated areas to transport soldiers safely .
israel wants 103 vehicles . " but at the end of june , the government approved the delivery of a test dingo , " nassauer said , adding that german governments have a history of arguing that it 's in germany 's interest to deliver weapons to israel .

bwin has about one million customers in germany . according to reuters news service , bwin shares fell 9.1 percent to 20.90 euros -lrb- $ 26.80 -rrb- following the announcement , extending a 31 percent drop on wednesday after a german newspaper reported saxony would withdraw the license . the company has already lost 89 percent of its market capitalization in the past three months . germany 's state monopoly has long come under criticism , including from the eu commission , which questions whether restrictions on private gambling companies is in line with eu 's competition laws . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german gambling faces good odds after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .

the country is on maximum terror alert . a total of 21 people were arrested in pre-dawn raids both in the london area and birmingham thursday over the alleged plot , which a senior police officer said was " an attempt to commit mass murder on an unimaginable scale . " home secretary reid said the plot was " very significant " and designed to " bring down a number of aircraft through mid-flight explosions , causing a considerable loss of life . " " whilst the police are confident that the main players have been accounted for , neither they nor the government are in any way complacent , " reid told a press conference , explaining the decision to raise britain 's security threat level to " critical , " the highest level . reports in the british media said the plot involved liquid chemical explosives which were to be smuggled aboard in hand baggage , though police have not yet confirmed these reports . major disruption at airports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers wait at the check-in desks for their flights from gatwick airport security was ordered to be tightened at british airports , where departing passengers were not allowed hand baggage except for articles placed in transparent bags .
there were also restrictions on fluids .
those travelling with an infant were required , for example , to taste the contents of bottles of baby milk . long and chaotic lines formed at british airports , including heathrow and stansted , as well as manchester in northern england . british airways cancelled all its short-haul inbound and outbound flights from heathrow to destinations at home and across europe until 1400 gmt . reacting to news of the foiled plot , german officials also upped security procedures at german airports .
thousands of passengers were stranded due to cancelled or delayed flights .

" we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks . " the social democrats ' interior expert , dieter wiefelspütz , however , warned against a frantic debate about security . " as long as the events in london are still under investigation , we should n't start talking about further consequences , " he told the netzeitung . months-long operation the british plot was uncovered after a joint operation by scotland yard 's anti-terrorist branch and the security services that lasted several months , london 's metropolitan police said . the heightened security alert comes 13 months after four british islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people and injured about 700 on london 's transport network . last month , al qaeda called on muslims to fight those who backed israel 's attacks on lebanon and warned of more attacks unless us and british forces pulled out of iraq and afghanistan . independent terrorism expert paul beaver said that the nature of the suspected plot suggested a connection to al qaeda . " in the last two months al qaeda promised that it would avenge iraq and afghanistan by attacking british and american aviation assets - i see a direct link with that , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on guard for terrorism linked to mideast german politicians have warned that the middle east crisis could inflame the muslim community in germany and increase the risk of militant islamist attacks .

" we were the better team for most of the match but just needed the goal , " lamented hamburg coach thomas doll .
" however we are good away from home too so all is not lost and we have to go there believing we can win the match and qualify . " belgian international defender vincent kompany , an eight million euro summer signing from anderlecht , hit the crossbar in the third minute after the ball came off his shoulder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's david jarolim in action last night peruvian international striker paolo guerrero then went close again for hamburg in an encouraging opening quarter hour . " we had so many chances it was incredible we did not score , " said kompany .
" we had no luck tonight but hopefully we will do in spain and if we can keep it tight at the back again we can go through . " osasuna , fourth in the spanish top-flight last season , had their first opening in the 23rd minute when roberto soldado blasted a shot at sascha kirschstein 's legs . the spanish visitors then had the ball in the net through veteran striker savo milosevic four minutes from the interval but the effort was ruled out for offside . two minutes into the second half ivory coast attacker boubacar sanogo missed a glorious chance to put hamburg ahead from just five yards . serbia international milosevic , who has over 100 caps for his country , then missed a sitter for osasuna on the hour fluffing his left-footed shot meters from the goal line . the misses contributed to a scoreless draw which osasuna will certainly be happier with . tie " evenly poised " for return leg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honors even : hsv will have to do it all again in spain " i think it is evenly poised as hamburg are strong away from home , " said osasuna coach angel ziganda .
" they had most of the chances tonight but we have a great goalkeeper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.08.2006 europe on high alert after british terror scare großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time the plot was foiled the thwarting of a plot in britain to blow up aircraft in mid-flight has underlined the need for europe to stay both tough and vigilant when it comes to fighting terrorism , according to security experts in germany . the thought of having narrowly avoided a potentially major terrorist attack sent jitters through western europe thursday as british authorities said they had foiled assaults on a " number of aircraft . "
police arrested 21 people in the uk as the incident once again raised questions about the level of threat europe faces from terrorism since the september 2001 attacks in new york and washington .
" this is certainly not just a british problem , but affects all europeans who are grappling with the problem of homegrown terrorism , " said berndt georg thamm , an expert on terrorism . not the only attack foiled ? " reality has caught up with us after the world cup , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union . -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" whether it 's the two bombs found in dortmund and koblenz on the rail network -lrb- earlier this month -rrb- or the current attack in england , it shows that there 's a constant latent threat , " janssen said .
" we ca n't afford to lower our guard . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flights in britain were grounded for most of the day on thursday others point out that the current incident is by no means an isolated one . " the media always seizes on the attacks that have already happened - sept .
11 , madrid , london , " said david schiller , a terrorism expert .
" but let 's not forget that , every year since sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorists have planned at least one attack or series of attacks in europe per year which have been foiled .
these things do n't make it into the press . " the handiwork of al qaeda ? though britain has n't released details on the identity of those arrested , experts say the nature of the alleged plot suggests a connection to al qaeda . " in the last two months al qaeda promised that it would avenge iraq and afghanistan by attacking british and american aviation assets - i see a direct link with that , " terrorism expert paul beaver told news agency reuters . all signs pointed to al qaeda planning a strike to coincide with the upcoming fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , schiller said .
" the organization is known for its penchant for symbolism and date-specific campaigns , " he said .
" and al qaeda is also known to target economic infrastructure , whether it 's tourism or aviation . " thamm also saw a link between the foiled plot and al qaeda , and he stressed that germany was n't immune to attacks . " it would be fatal for germany to think we are in a special position because we did n't participate in the war against iraq , " thamm said , pointing out that germany had 2,800 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
" black , red , gold really is n't a bullet-proof vest anymore . " hand luggage a " weak link " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports that the bombers were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been increased at german airports experts say the tactic is sophisticated , though the idea is n't entirely new .
in dec .
2001 , so-called " shoe bomber " richard reid was overpowered after trying to set light to a fuse connected to explosives in his shoes before boarding an american airlines flight in paris . " though there are loopholes in the entire machinery fighting terrorism , hand luggage does remain a weak link , " schiller said , adding that technologies to better scrutinize carry-on luggage , such as sniffing out explosives , still remain in the pipeline . " let 's face it - we will not manage to prevent all attacks .
intelligence gathering and security measures can at the most work as the last firewall . " getting close to the masterminds at the same time , experts say that british officials ' thwarting of the alleged terrorist plot could boost the fight against terror . " with security officials preventing the attack well in time , there is a good chance that enough proof can be furnished during a legal trial - which is the right way to go about preventing a major crime , " said jansen .
" we have to try to get as close as possible to the masterminds behind the attack . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain : main players in foiled plane attacks accounted for british home secretary john reid said thursday police were confident " the main players have been accounted for " in an alleged plot to blow up several us-bound aircraft .
the country is on maximum terror alert .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .
in beirut , the government offered to deploy lebanese troops in the south , and in jerusalem , the plans to expand the israeli offensive were put on hold .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .
in beirut , the government offered to deploy lebanese troops in the south , and in jerusalem , the plans to expand the israeli offensive were put on hold .

"
police arrested 21 people in the uk as the incident once again raised questions about the level of threat europe faces from terrorism since the september 2001 attacks in new york and washington .
" this is certainly not just a british problem , but affects all europeans who are grappling with the problem of homegrown terrorism , " said berndt georg thamm , an expert on terrorism . not the only attack foiled ? " reality has caught up with us after the world cup , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union . -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" whether it 's the two bombs found in dortmund and koblenz on the rail network -lrb- earlier this month -rrb- or the current attack in england , it shows that there 's a constant latent threat , " janssen said .
" we ca n't afford to lower our guard . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flights in britain were grounded for most of the day on thursday others point out that the current incident is by no means an isolated one . " the media always seizes on the attacks that have already happened - sept .
11 , madrid , london , " said david schiller , a terrorism expert .
" but let 's not forget that , every year since sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorists have planned at least one attack or series of attacks in europe per year which have been foiled .
these things do n't make it into the press . " the handiwork of al qaeda ? though britain has n't released details on the identity of those arrested , experts say the nature of the alleged plot suggests a connection to al qaeda . " in the last two months al qaeda promised that it would avenge iraq and afghanistan by attacking british and american aviation assets - i see a direct link with that , " terrorism expert paul beaver told news agency reuters . all signs pointed to al qaeda planning a strike to coincide with the upcoming fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , schiller said .
" the organization is known for its penchant for symbolism and date-specific campaigns , " he said .
" and al qaeda is also known to target economic infrastructure , whether it 's tourism or aviation . " thamm also saw a link between the foiled plot and al qaeda , and he stressed that germany was n't immune to attacks . " it would be fatal for germany to think we are in a special position because we did n't participate in the war against iraq , " thamm said , pointing out that germany had 2,800 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
" black , red , gold really is n't a bullet-proof vest anymore . " hand luggage a " weak link " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports that the bombers were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been increased at german airports experts say the tactic is sophisticated , though the idea is n't entirely new .
in dec .
2001 , so-called " shoe bomber " richard reid was overpowered after trying to set light to a fuse connected to explosives in his shoes before boarding an american airlines flight in paris . " though there are loopholes in the entire machinery fighting terrorism , hand luggage does remain a weak link , " schiller said , adding that technologies to better scrutinize carry-on luggage , such as sniffing out explosives , still remain in the pipeline . " let 's face it - we will not manage to prevent all attacks .
intelligence gathering and security measures can at the most work as the last firewall . " getting close to the masterminds at the same time , experts say that british officials ' thwarting of the alleged terrorist plot could boost the fight against terror . " with security officials preventing the attack well in time , there is a good chance that enough proof can be furnished during a legal trial - which is the right way to go about preventing a major crime , " said jansen .
" we have to try to get as close as possible to the masterminds behind the attack .

other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .

employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd .

critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees .

" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering .

he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .
as early as 1964 , german patrol boats and used tanks were sent to israel .
in 1991 , german patriot anti missile defense systems protected the israeli population against iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's scud missiles .
while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel .

germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea .

israel wants 103 vehicles . " but at the end of june , the government approved the delivery of a test dingo , " nassauer said , adding that german governments have a history of arguing that it 's in germany 's interest to deliver weapons to israel .

critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .
" we want to show that it is no way unique .

there 's just one problem : the newly renovated theater is n't safe for the public yet . in honor of bertolt brecht year , one of his most famous play 's - " the three penny opera " - is scheduled to open friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast . hasty renovations , under the auspices of entrepreneur falk walter , came down to the wire and the city gave its final approval for public use thursday , one day before the premiere . fire safety issues such as emergency exit signs and smoke alarms were the major concerns . producer klaus maria brandauer and his crew may be used to a little drama - after all , that 's their job - but they can certainly breathe a bit easier now knowing that the audience will be allowed to take a sit for friday 's performance . brecht 's beggars satirize weimar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this inside looks good - it 's the foyer that 's unfinished " people tell us that they want to get unemployment down to three or four million - or even half of what it is now - and then they ask us why we 're performing this piece , " brandauer told german public tv broadcaster 's " titel , thesen , temperamente " program . the work , which premiered in berlin in 1928 , is a pointed satire of capitalist society .
brecht , who moved to east germany after living in exile during world war ii , was known for his socialist leanings and politicized plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1940 , germany was at war and there was no gdr in a twist of irony , the founding of the sed , former east germany 's governing socialist party , took place in the admiralspalast in 1955 .

austrian-based online bookmaker bwin faces complete closure of its german business after the eastern german state of saxony revoked its licence .
bwin officials have said they will fight the decision . calling the decision a " political assault , " bwin official manfred bodner told reporters that his company would file a lawsuit claiming damages against saxony . state officials on thursday revoked the betting license and banned the company from advertising its services .
they cited a march ruling by germany 's highest court that upheld a state monopoly on gambling in germany while calling on states to do more to combat gambling addiction . saxon officials added that the ban is effective throughout germany 's 3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- gambling market as bwin 's license was based on the saxon permit . east germa n lice n se despite the state monopoly , bwin - formerly known as betandwin , argues that the license , which was issued by the outgoing former east german government in 1990 , remains valid .
bwin has about one million customers in germany . according to reuters news service , bwin shares fell 9.1 percent to 20.90 euros -lrb- $ 26.80 -rrb- following the announcement , extending a 31 percent drop on wednesday after a german newspaper reported saxony would withdraw the license . the company has already lost 89 percent of its market capitalization in the past three months . germany 's state monopoly has long come under criticism , including from the eu commission , which questions whether restrictions on private gambling companies is in line with eu 's competition laws . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german gambling faces good odds after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .

two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .

"
police arrested 21 people in the uk as the incident once again raised questions about the level of threat europe faces from terrorism since the september 2001 attacks in new york and washington .
" this is certainly not just a british problem , but affects all europeans who are grappling with the problem of homegrown terrorism , " said berndt georg thamm , an expert on terrorism . not the only attack foiled ? " reality has caught up with us after the world cup , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union . -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" whether it 's the two bombs found in dortmund and koblenz on the rail network -lrb- earlier this month -rrb- or the current attack in england , it shows that there 's a constant latent threat , " janssen said .
" we ca n't afford to lower our guard . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flights in britain were grounded for most of the day on thursday others point out that the current incident is by no means an isolated one . " the media always seizes on the attacks that have already happened - sept .
11 , madrid , london , " said david schiller , a terrorism expert .
" but let 's not forget that , every year since sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorists have planned at least one attack or series of attacks in europe per year which have been foiled .
these things do n't make it into the press . " the handiwork of al qaeda ? though britain has n't released details on the identity of those arrested , experts say the nature of the alleged plot suggests a connection to al qaeda . " in the last two months al qaeda promised that it would avenge iraq and afghanistan by attacking british and american aviation assets - i see a direct link with that , " terrorism expert paul beaver told news agency reuters . all signs pointed to al qaeda planning a strike to coincide with the upcoming fifth anniversary of the sept .
11 attacks , schiller said .
" the organization is known for its penchant for symbolism and date-specific campaigns , " he said .
" and al qaeda is also known to target economic infrastructure , whether it 's tourism or aviation . " thamm also saw a link between the foiled plot and al qaeda , and he stressed that germany was n't immune to attacks . " it would be fatal for germany to think we are in a special position because we did n't participate in the war against iraq , " thamm said , pointing out that germany had 2,800 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
" black , red , gold really is n't a bullet-proof vest anymore . " hand luggage a " weak link " airports around europe have beefed up security after reports that the bombers were planning to smuggle liquid explosives in hand luggage with battery triggers possibly stored in laptops or calculators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been increased at german airports experts say the tactic is sophisticated , though the idea is n't entirely new .
in dec .
2001 , so-called " shoe bomber " richard reid was overpowered after trying to set light to a fuse connected to explosives in his shoes before boarding an american airlines flight in paris . " though there are loopholes in the entire machinery fighting terrorism , hand luggage does remain a weak link , " schiller said , adding that technologies to better scrutinize carry-on luggage , such as sniffing out explosives , still remain in the pipeline . " let 's face it - we will not manage to prevent all attacks .
intelligence gathering and security measures can at the most work as the last firewall . " getting close to the masterminds at the same time , experts say that british officials ' thwarting of the alleged terrorist plot could boost the fight against terror . " with security officials preventing the attack well in time , there is a good chance that enough proof can be furnished during a legal trial - which is the right way to go about preventing a major crime , " said jansen .
" we have to try to get as close as possible to the masterminds behind the attack . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain : main players in foiled plane attacks accounted for british home secretary john reid said thursday police were confident " the main players have been accounted for " in an alleged plot to blow up several us-bound aircraft .

brecht , who moved to east germany after living in exile during world war ii , was known for his socialist leanings and politicized plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1940 , germany was at war and there was no gdr in a twist of irony , the founding of the sed , former east germany 's governing socialist party , took place in the admiralspalast in 1955 .
brecht had been a member of the german communist party -lrb- kpd -rrb- , the forerunner to the sed .
he did not officially join the sed , though the former east german government attempted to glorify his work for their purposes . " the three penny opera , " a tale of beggars , prostitutes and thieves in london 's soho district in the 1920s , depicts the darker side of big city life .
though set in england , brecht was actually criticizing bourgeois-capitalism in germany 's weimar republic -lrb- 1913-1933 -rrb- . frustration with poverty was , apparently , not a 20th century phenomenon : brecht based the play on the 1728 " beggar 's opera " by john gray -lrb- text -rrb- and johann christoph pepusch -lrb- music -rrb- . rock star takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock star campino knows the stage but is new to theater campino , the 44-year-old lead singer of the german punk rock band " die toten hosen , " will make his theater debut in the lead role , mack the knife . elements of jazz and lighter entertainment music come through in kurt weill 's score to " the three penny opera .

sacred and operatic melodies can also be heard .
in any case , the role will be a test of campino 's versatility as a musician , not to mention his acting skills . in yet another case of irony , the admiralspalast production of the anti-capitalist theatre piece is not subsidized by the german government but has received private sponsorship from deutsche bank . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamour will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd .

" excelle n ce as competitive adva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans keep shipping their products overseas germany 's labor costs are on par with those of its trading partners and competitors , horn said , adding that one must also look at a country 's productivity . " germany is a leader in exports , " jung said .
" that would not be possible if labor costs were too high here . " the iw 's schröder begged to differ . " high labor costs do indeed put a country or business region under pressure , " he said .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .

other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros .

schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .

the whole system fell into decay as funding dried up , sponsors looked elsewhere , infrastructure languished and young players left . experts point out that the woes plaguing eastern german soccer mirror the region 's financial problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen sparwasser -lrb- left -rrb- during his historic goal in 1974 , which clinched a win over west germany " soccer in the former east is not advancing because of the economic situation , " jürgen sparwasser , a gdr soccer legend who is working on setting up a new soccer training school in eastern germany close to potsdam , told news agency reuters recently . " it is hard to find sponsors and , though there are still good youth training facilities , they ca n't afford to keep their talent .

if germany feels that it will be a backlash towards its muslim and arabic population , then that basically means that you care more about appeasing and promoting terrorism and the destruction of israel , and that you have fear towards your muslim and arabic populations . - lavalore as a person of german descent , i believe germany should stay neutral .
israel is a country with too many problems .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .
as early as 1964 , german patrol boats and used tanks were sent to israel .
in 1991 , german patriot anti missile defense systems protected the israeli population against iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's scud missiles .
while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel . " in the interest of israeli security and the security of its citizens and for moral and historical reasons , we will help , " then chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time . deliveri n g weapo n s parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli helicopters use german technology but the delivery of complete arms systems has been the exception .
germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea . " co n cer n s about use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli tank in the west bank town of nablus in 2001 but germany also rejects delivery requests for some weapons systems because they could be used against palestinians . " israel does n't get weapons that could obviously be used to combat palestinian rioters , " nassauer said , adding that israel has unsuccessfully tried to get an armed vehicle called dingo , which can be used in densely populated areas to transport soldiers safely .
israel wants 103 vehicles . " but at the end of june , the government approved the delivery of a test dingo , " nassauer said , adding that german governments have a history of arguing that it 's in germany 's interest to deliver weapons to israel . " israel gets much , much more than most other countries , " nassauer said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : german firms involved in illegal arms exports to iran even as tensions simmer between iran and the west over teheran 's nuclear program , security sources in germany say around 100 dummy firms are illegally exporting arms to the islamic country .

" we were the better team for most of the match but just needed the goal , " lamented hamburg coach thomas doll .

" home secretary reid said the plot was " very significant " and designed to " bring down a number of aircraft through mid-flight explosions , causing a considerable loss of life . " " whilst the police are confident that the main players have been accounted for , neither they nor the government are in any way complacent , " reid told a press conference , explaining the decision to raise britain 's security threat level to " critical , " the highest level . reports in the british media said the plot involved liquid chemical explosives which were to be smuggled aboard in hand baggage , though police have not yet confirmed these reports . major disruption at airports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers wait at the check-in desks for their flights from gatwick airport security was ordered to be tightened at british airports , where departing passengers were not allowed hand baggage except for articles placed in transparent bags .

" we have to determine whether , in a similar situation , we would have discovered the explosive material in baggage checks . " the social democrats ' interior expert , dieter wiefelspütz , however , warned against a frantic debate about security . " as long as the events in london are still under investigation , we should n't start talking about further consequences , " he told the netzeitung . months-long operation the british plot was uncovered after a joint operation by scotland yard 's anti-terrorist branch and the security services that lasted several months , london 's metropolitan police said . the heightened security alert comes 13 months after four british islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people and injured about 700 on london 's transport network . last month , al qaeda called on muslims to fight those who backed israel 's attacks on lebanon and warned of more attacks unless us and british forces pulled out of iraq and afghanistan . independent terrorism expert paul beaver said that the nature of the suspected plot suggested a connection to al qaeda .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .

they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .
as early as 1964 , german patrol boats and used tanks were sent to israel .
in 1991 , german patriot anti missile defense systems protected the israeli population against iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's scud missiles .
while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel . " in the interest of israeli security and the security of its citizens and for moral and historical reasons , we will help , " then chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time . deliveri n g weapo n s parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli helicopters use german technology but the delivery of complete arms systems has been the exception .
germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .
in beirut , the government offered to deploy lebanese troops in the south , and in jerusalem , the plans to expand the israeli offensive were put on hold .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .

additionally , the temptation for israelis to damage german troops will be an opportunity too great for them to resist .
rather , germany 's role should be to insist on an end to the slaughter and its leaders should sternly call for a halt to israeli barbarities . - michael davis the israeli army is being used by the usa as a military arm of the us forces .
so it would do no good for german troops to get involved because the usa is in control and will do whatever it wants to do in the middle east and what it wants is to get all that oil for the usa . - james wilder , usa please do not send german soldiers to lebanon ; it is very dangerous and they could be bombarded by israel like the canadian at the un post .

" we were the better team for most of the match but just needed the goal , " lamented hamburg coach thomas doll .
" however we are good away from home too so all is not lost and we have to go there believing we can win the match and qualify . " belgian international defender vincent kompany , an eight million euro summer signing from anderlecht , hit the crossbar in the third minute after the ball came off his shoulder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's david jarolim in action last night peruvian international striker paolo guerrero then went close again for hamburg in an encouraging opening quarter hour . " we had so many chances it was incredible we did not score , " said kompany .
" we had no luck tonight but hopefully we will do in spain and if we can keep it tight at the back again we can go through . " osasuna , fourth in the spanish top-flight last season , had their first opening in the 23rd minute when roberto soldado blasted a shot at sascha kirschstein 's legs . the spanish visitors then had the ball in the net through veteran striker savo milosevic four minutes from the interval but the effort was ruled out for offside . two minutes into the second half ivory coast attacker boubacar sanogo missed a glorious chance to put hamburg ahead from just five yards . serbia international milosevic , who has over 100 caps for his country , then missed a sitter for osasuna on the hour fluffing his left-footed shot meters from the goal line . the misses contributed to a scoreless draw which osasuna will certainly be happier with . tie " evenly poised " for return leg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honors even : hsv will have to do it all again in spain " i think it is evenly poised as hamburg are strong away from home , " said osasuna coach angel ziganda .

but , energie cottbus have stirred hope after being promoted to the bundesliga for the upcoming season . the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- has spawned some of germany 's best players , including stars michael ballack , bernd schneider and tim borowski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack may be the most famous face of eastern germany , but he does n't live there anymore but , unfortunately , that 's where the good news ends .
all the aforementioned players have left the region and headed west and have been followed by a steady stream of further soccer talent over the years . the talent drain has also affected clubs in the region - so much so that in the 2005/2006 season the bundesliga was without a team from the former east for the first time since reunification . cottbus brings hope to old east but now , the region 's slipping soccer fortunes have received a boost with the promotion of energie cottbus to the top division for the 2006/07 season . cottbus finished third in the second division last season to win promotion along with vfl bochum and alemannia aachen and are now the only team from the former gdr in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energie cottbus logo founded by coal miners in 1966 , cottbus have budgeted close to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- to beat the drain , and polish international mariusz kukielka and china international shao jiayi are two major arrivals . nevertheless , petrik sander , regarded as one of the most promising managers in germany , admits his team are favorites for an immediate return to the second division .
cottbus , cup runners-up in 1997 , may not be a glamour name in german soccer but they have experience of the top-flight , spending three consecutive seasons in the bundesliga from 2000 to 2003 . on april 6 , 2001 , the club made bundesliga history when they became the first club to field 11 foreigners , in a 0-0 league draw with vfl wolfsburg . cottbus kick off their campaign against borussia mönchengladbach on saturday carrying the hopes of eastern germany on their shoulders . bleak future despite cottbus ' leap to the country 's top league , there 's little denying that the defunct east germany 's soccer future is in bad shape . clubs like dynamo dresden , once a proud and prominent team in the gdr and which later played in the bundesliga , have since crashed out of the professional game . once renowned for its enviable network of rigorous youth training programs and soccer academies , eastern germany failed to maintain its high soccer standards after reunification in 1990 .
the whole system fell into decay as funding dried up , sponsors looked elsewhere , infrastructure languished and young players left . experts point out that the woes plaguing eastern german soccer mirror the region 's financial problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen sparwasser -lrb- left -rrb- during his historic goal in 1974 , which clinched a win over west germany " soccer in the former east is not advancing because of the economic situation , " jürgen sparwasser , a gdr soccer legend who is working on setting up a new soccer training school in eastern germany close to potsdam , told news agency reuters recently . " it is hard to find sponsors and , though there are still good youth training facilities , they ca n't afford to keep their talent . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany will have even better players in the future " with the world cup over , dw-world.de spoke to christian streich , a leading youth soccer coach , about lessons learned , the challenges of producing tomorrow ’ s ballacks and kloses and catching up with latin america .
-lrb- july 10 , 2006 -rrb- divisions in soccer mirror germany 's ills germany is presenting a united front as host nation for soccer 's world cup .

cottbus , cup runners-up in 1997 , may not be a glamour name in german soccer but they have experience of the top-flight , spending three consecutive seasons in the bundesliga from 2000 to 2003 . on april 6 , 2001 , the club made bundesliga history when they became the first club to field 11 foreigners , in a 0-0 league draw with vfl wolfsburg . cottbus kick off their campaign against borussia mönchengladbach on saturday carrying the hopes of eastern germany on their shoulders . bleak future despite cottbus ' leap to the country 's top league , there 's little denying that the defunct east germany 's soccer future is in bad shape . clubs like dynamo dresden , once a proud and prominent team in the gdr and which later played in the bundesliga , have since crashed out of the professional game . once renowned for its enviable network of rigorous youth training programs and soccer academies , eastern germany failed to maintain its high soccer standards after reunification in 1990 .
the whole system fell into decay as funding dried up , sponsors looked elsewhere , infrastructure languished and young players left . experts point out that the woes plaguing eastern german soccer mirror the region 's financial problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen sparwasser -lrb- left -rrb- during his historic goal in 1974 , which clinched a win over west germany " soccer in the former east is not advancing because of the economic situation , " jürgen sparwasser , a gdr soccer legend who is working on setting up a new soccer training school in eastern germany close to potsdam , told news agency reuters recently . " it is hard to find sponsors and , though there are still good youth training facilities , they ca n't afford to keep their talent .

other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd .

there 's just one problem : the newly renovated theater is n't safe for the public yet . in honor of bertolt brecht year , one of his most famous play 's - " the three penny opera " - is scheduled to open friday in berlin 's historic admiralspalast . hasty renovations , under the auspices of entrepreneur falk walter , came down to the wire and the city gave its final approval for public use thursday , one day before the premiere . fire safety issues such as emergency exit signs and smoke alarms were the major concerns . producer klaus maria brandauer and his crew may be used to a little drama - after all , that 's their job - but they can certainly breathe a bit easier now knowing that the audience will be allowed to take a sit for friday 's performance . brecht 's beggars satirize weimar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this inside looks good - it 's the foyer that 's unfinished " people tell us that they want to get unemployment down to three or four million - or even half of what it is now - and then they ask us why we 're performing this piece , " brandauer told german public tv broadcaster 's " titel , thesen , temperamente " program . the work , which premiered in berlin in 1928 , is a pointed satire of capitalist society .
brecht , who moved to east germany after living in exile during world war ii , was known for his socialist leanings and politicized plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1940 , germany was at war and there was no gdr in a twist of irony , the founding of the sed , former east germany 's governing socialist party , took place in the admiralspalast in 1955 .
brecht had been a member of the german communist party -lrb- kpd -rrb- , the forerunner to the sed .
he did not officially join the sed , though the former east german government attempted to glorify his work for their purposes . " the three penny opera , " a tale of beggars , prostitutes and thieves in london 's soho district in the 1920s , depicts the darker side of big city life .
though set in england , brecht was actually criticizing bourgeois-capitalism in germany 's weimar republic -lrb- 1913-1933 -rrb- . frustration with poverty was , apparently , not a 20th century phenomenon : brecht based the play on the 1728 " beggar 's opera " by john gray -lrb- text -rrb- and johann christoph pepusch -lrb- music -rrb- . rock star takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock star campino knows the stage but is new to theater campino , the 44-year-old lead singer of the german punk rock band " die toten hosen , " will make his theater debut in the lead role , mack the knife . elements of jazz and lighter entertainment music come through in kurt weill 's score to " the three penny opera .

sacred and operatic melodies can also be heard .
in any case , the role will be a test of campino 's versatility as a musician , not to mention his acting skills . in yet another case of irony , the admiralspalast production of the anti-capitalist theatre piece is not subsidized by the german government but has received private sponsorship from deutsche bank . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamour will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 10.08.2006 should germany send peacekeepers to lebanon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far germany has made no decision dw-world.de readers sounded off on whether germany should send troops to lebanon as part of a possible un peacekeeping force in the current conflict between israel , lebanon and the hezbollah . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . one can only imagine the reaction of the world press should it become necessary for german soldiers to fire on israeli forces .
additionally , the temptation for israelis to damage german troops will be an opportunity too great for them to resist .
rather , germany 's role should be to insist on an end to the slaughter and its leaders should sternly call for a halt to israeli barbarities . - michael davis the israeli army is being used by the usa as a military arm of the us forces .
so it would do no good for german troops to get involved because the usa is in control and will do whatever it wants to do in the middle east and what it wants is to get all that oil for the usa . - james wilder , usa please do not send german soldiers to lebanon ; it is very dangerous and they could be bombarded by israel like the canadian at the un post .
do not trust them .
remember the uss ' liberty ' ship in the mediterranean sea in 1967 ?
how many american soldiers were slaughtered ? 34 and 171 wounded .
so please save the young soldiers .
it is not worth it to die helping the bad cause . - agatha king , toronto , canada nazi germany is still too present in the minds of the israeli people and would only be relived by the soldiers ' presence . - helga anderson , toronto , canada of course they should be sent .
then we can see if the german government is really truthful when it says all must be done to support israel , as it now says 60 years after the fact .
german soldiers should be dying to protect israel - that shows real support . - ernst stetz the german people are right to avoid entanglement in the current israeli / lebanese conflict .
the prospect of german troops having to fire on either side is unacceptable , as is prime minister olmert 's recent request for australian troops to be sent to this grossly uneven conflict .
germans and australians would be well advised to remain outside the conflict and to implement policies which are fair to both combatants . - michael arthur vaughan , australia as much as i feel that the eu should be backing off when it comes to israel , i 'm stunned that olmert would seriously consider germany as a peacekeeping force in southern lebanon .
if germany feels that it will be a backlash towards its muslim and arabic population , then that basically means that you care more about appeasing and promoting terrorism and the destruction of israel , and that you have fear towards your muslim and arabic populations . - lavalore as a person of german descent , i believe germany should stay neutral .
israel is a country with too many problems .
let the french get involved , give them the " honor " to feel important .
why should german soldiers get hurt in a conflict with no good ending in sight ? - nicole complied by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .
-lrb- aug .
3 , 2006 -rrb- merkel skeptical about sending german troops to middle east german chancellor angela merkel has said in an interview that at the present time she does not support the idea of german troops being part of a peacekeeping contingent in lebanon .
-lrb- aug .
29 , 2006 -rrb- violence in the middle east read dw-world.de 's dossier on the escalating violence in the middle east and the search for peace .

the country is on maximum terror alert . a total of 21 people were arrested in pre-dawn raids both in the london area and birmingham thursday over the alleged plot , which a senior police officer said was " an attempt to commit mass murder on an unimaginable scale . " home secretary reid said the plot was " very significant " and designed to " bring down a number of aircraft through mid-flight explosions , causing a considerable loss of life . " " whilst the police are confident that the main players have been accounted for , neither they nor the government are in any way complacent , " reid told a press conference , explaining the decision to raise britain 's security threat level to " critical , " the highest level . reports in the british media said the plot involved liquid chemical explosives which were to be smuggled aboard in hand baggage , though police have not yet confirmed these reports . major disruption at airports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers wait at the check-in desks for their flights from gatwick airport security was ordered to be tightened at british airports , where departing passengers were not allowed hand baggage except for articles placed in transparent bags .

" as long as the events in london are still under investigation , we should n't start talking about further consequences , " he told the netzeitung . months-long operation the british plot was uncovered after a joint operation by scotland yard 's anti-terrorist branch and the security services that lasted several months , london 's metropolitan police said . the heightened security alert comes 13 months after four british islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people and injured about 700 on london 's transport network . last month , al qaeda called on muslims to fight those who backed israel 's attacks on lebanon and warned of more attacks unless us and british forces pulled out of iraq and afghanistan . independent terrorism expert paul beaver said that the nature of the suspected plot suggested a connection to al qaeda .

they cited a march ruling by germany 's highest court that upheld a state monopoly on gambling in germany while calling on states to do more to combat gambling addiction . saxon officials added that the ban is effective throughout germany 's 3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- gambling market as bwin 's license was based on the saxon permit . east germa n lice n se despite the state monopoly , bwin - formerly known as betandwin , argues that the license , which was issued by the outgoing former east german government in 1990 , remains valid .
bwin has about one million customers in germany . according to reuters news service , bwin shares fell 9.1 percent to 20.90 euros -lrb- $ 26.80 -rrb- following the announcement , extending a 31 percent drop on wednesday after a german newspaper reported saxony would withdraw the license . the company has already lost 89 percent of its market capitalization in the past three months . germany 's state monopoly has long come under criticism , including from the eu commission , which questions whether restrictions on private gambling companies is in line with eu 's competition laws . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german gambling faces good odds after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .

but , energie cottbus have stirred hope after being promoted to the bundesliga for the upcoming season . the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- has spawned some of germany 's best players , including stars michael ballack , bernd schneider and tim borowski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack may be the most famous face of eastern germany , but he does n't live there anymore but , unfortunately , that 's where the good news ends .
all the aforementioned players have left the region and headed west and have been followed by a steady stream of further soccer talent over the years . the talent drain has also affected clubs in the region - so much so that in the 2005/2006 season the bundesliga was without a team from the former east for the first time since reunification . cottbus brings hope to old east but now , the region 's slipping soccer fortunes have received a boost with the promotion of energie cottbus to the top division for the 2006/07 season . cottbus finished third in the second division last season to win promotion along with vfl bochum and alemannia aachen and are now the only team from the former gdr in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energie cottbus logo founded by coal miners in 1966 , cottbus have budgeted close to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- to beat the drain , and polish international mariusz kukielka and china international shao jiayi are two major arrivals . nevertheless , petrik sander , regarded as one of the most promising managers in germany , admits his team are favorites for an immediate return to the second division .
cottbus , cup runners-up in 1997 , may not be a glamour name in german soccer but they have experience of the top-flight , spending three consecutive seasons in the bundesliga from 2000 to 2003 . on april 6 , 2001 , the club made bundesliga history when they became the first club to field 11 foreigners , in a 0-0 league draw with vfl wolfsburg . cottbus kick off their campaign against borussia mönchengladbach on saturday carrying the hopes of eastern germany on their shoulders . bleak future despite cottbus ' leap to the country 's top league , there 's little denying that the defunct east germany 's soccer future is in bad shape . clubs like dynamo dresden , once a proud and prominent team in the gdr and which later played in the bundesliga , have since crashed out of the professional game . once renowned for its enviable network of rigorous youth training programs and soccer academies , eastern germany failed to maintain its high soccer standards after reunification in 1990 .
the whole system fell into decay as funding dried up , sponsors looked elsewhere , infrastructure languished and young players left . experts point out that the woes plaguing eastern german soccer mirror the region 's financial problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen sparwasser -lrb- left -rrb- during his historic goal in 1974 , which clinched a win over west germany " soccer in the former east is not advancing because of the economic situation , " jürgen sparwasser , a gdr soccer legend who is working on setting up a new soccer training school in eastern germany close to potsdam , told news agency reuters recently .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .

israeli prime minister ehud olmert recently described germany as his country 's " best friend " and encouraged it to engage militarily in lebanon .
but when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier came to explore diplomatic solutions , olmert kept him waiting while his government decided to greatly expand israel 's offensive in southern lebanon .
even the united states - in all likelihood a much greater " friend " of israel 's - was apparently surprised by the israeli cabinet 's decision .
internationally , the chances of securing a resolution for southern lebanon in the near future seemed to disappear , because the israeli military spoke of a large-scale offensive that could last up to 30 days .
israeli soldiers were meant to comb the area up to the litani rivier , driving out any hezbollah guerrillas . then , in the early hours of thursday morning , came the surprising news that the offensive had been suspended in order to give diplomacy a chance .
the middle east is always good for surprises - even those of a positive nature . signal from washington but it would probably be too optimistic to believe that the suspension could turn into a cancellation and that diplomats really are in a position to solve the problems that have caused this war .
the assumption that the german foreign minister played a decisive role in the suspension of the planned offensive would also be too optimistic - for that , a signal from washington must surely have come .
israel may have had unreserved support until now , but the americans have of course begun to realize that this war has to end if the position of the us , particularly in the arab world , is to escape further political damage . at this point , germany has more of a bit part than starring role , which is why it was quite a bold step for frank-walter steinmeier to make a second trip to beirut and jerusalem in such a short period of time - without any concrete plans or suggestions under his arm , and without the mandate or influence of a mediator . steinmeier 's visit would have gone down as a total failure , had the parties not suddenly taken matters into their own hands .
in beirut , the government offered to deploy lebanese troops in the south , and in jerusalem , the plans to expand the israeli offensive were put on hold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.08.2006 debating the damage of high labor costs for german business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german standards have a high price a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .
other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd . " excelle n ce as competitive adva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans keep shipping their products overseas germany 's labor costs are on par with those of its trading partners and competitors , horn said , adding that one must also look at a country 's productivity . " germany is a leader in exports , " jung said .
" that would not be possible if labor costs were too high here . " the iw 's schröder begged to differ . " high labor costs do indeed put a country or business region under pressure , " he said .
" many companies manufacture elsewhere .
german businesses must try to balance it out by offering top-quality products and high-precision technology tailored to the needs of their customers .

all the aforementioned players have left the region and headed west and have been followed by a steady stream of further soccer talent over the years . the talent drain has also affected clubs in the region - so much so that in the 2005/2006 season the bundesliga was without a team from the former east for the first time since reunification . cottbus brings hope to old east but now , the region 's slipping soccer fortunes have received a boost with the promotion of energie cottbus to the top division for the 2006/07 season . cottbus finished third in the second division last season to win promotion along with vfl bochum and alemannia aachen and are now the only team from the former gdr in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energie cottbus logo founded by coal miners in 1966 , cottbus have budgeted close to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.6 million -rrb- to beat the drain , and polish international mariusz kukielka and china international shao jiayi are two major arrivals . nevertheless , petrik sander , regarded as one of the most promising managers in germany , admits his team are favorites for an immediate return to the second division .
cottbus , cup runners-up in 1997 , may not be a glamour name in german soccer but they have experience of the top-flight , spending three consecutive seasons in the bundesliga from 2000 to 2003 . on april 6 , 2001 , the club made bundesliga history when they became the first club to field 11 foreigners , in a 0-0 league draw with vfl wolfsburg . cottbus kick off their campaign against borussia mönchengladbach on saturday carrying the hopes of eastern germany on their shoulders . bleak future despite cottbus ' leap to the country 's top league , there 's little denying that the defunct east germany 's soccer future is in bad shape . clubs like dynamo dresden , once a proud and prominent team in the gdr and which later played in the bundesliga , have since crashed out of the professional game . once renowned for its enviable network of rigorous youth training programs and soccer academies , eastern germany failed to maintain its high soccer standards after reunification in 1990 .
the whole system fell into decay as funding dried up , sponsors looked elsewhere , infrastructure languished and young players left . experts point out that the woes plaguing eastern german soccer mirror the region 's financial problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen sparwasser -lrb- left -rrb- during his historic goal in 1974 , which clinched a win over west germany " soccer in the former east is not advancing because of the economic situation , " jürgen sparwasser , a gdr soccer legend who is working on setting up a new soccer training school in eastern germany close to potsdam , told news agency reuters recently .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .

while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel .

germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .

the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .

exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .

critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white .

he did not officially join the sed , though the former east german government attempted to glorify his work for their purposes . " the three penny opera , " a tale of beggars , prostitutes and thieves in london 's soho district in the 1920s , depicts the darker side of big city life .
though set in england , brecht was actually criticizing bourgeois-capitalism in germany 's weimar republic -lrb- 1913-1933 -rrb- . frustration with poverty was , apparently , not a 20th century phenomenon : brecht based the play on the 1728 " beggar 's opera " by john gray -lrb- text -rrb- and johann christoph pepusch -lrb- music -rrb- . rock star takes the lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock star campino knows the stage but is new to theater campino , the 44-year-old lead singer of the german punk rock band " die toten hosen , " will make his theater debut in the lead role , mack the knife . elements of jazz and lighter entertainment music come through in kurt weill 's score to " the three penny opera .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.08.2006 debating the damage of high labor costs for german business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german standards have a high price a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .
other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.08.2006 controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a silesian boy crouches in front of the remants of his family 's home in 1945 organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday . called " paths unchosen , " the exhibition in the stately kro n pri n ze n palais , which served as a state palace under the prussians , in downtown berlin documents the fates of millions of war refugees in europe in the 20th century .
exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .
" we want to show that it is no way unique .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.08.2006 debating the damage of high labor costs for german business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german standards have a high price a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .
other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd . " excelle n ce as competitive adva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans keep shipping their products overseas germany 's labor costs are on par with those of its trading partners and competitors , horn said , adding that one must also look at a country 's productivity . " germany is a leader in exports , " jung said .
" that would not be possible if labor costs were too high here . " the iw 's schröder begged to differ . " high labor costs do indeed put a country or business region under pressure , " he said .
" many companies manufacture elsewhere .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .
as early as 1964 , german patrol boats and used tanks were sent to israel .
in 1991 , german patriot anti missile defense systems protected the israeli population against iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's scud missiles .
while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel . " in the interest of israeli security and the security of its citizens and for moral and historical reasons , we will help , " then chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time . deliveri n g weapo n s parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli helicopters use german technology but the delivery of complete arms systems has been the exception .
germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea . " co n cer n s about use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli tank in the west bank town of nablus in 2001 but germany also rejects delivery requests for some weapons systems because they could be used against palestinians . " israel does n't get weapons that could obviously be used to combat palestinian rioters , " nassauer said , adding that israel has unsuccessfully tried to get an armed vehicle called dingo , which can be used in densely populated areas to transport soldiers safely .
israel wants 103 vehicles . " but at the end of june , the government approved the delivery of a test dingo , " nassauer said , adding that german governments have a history of arguing that it 's in germany 's interest to deliver weapons to israel .

germany has a long history of providing israel with weapons and their components . as german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his tour of the middle east , opposition lawmakers and various political organizations at home are stepping up their criticism of israel 's military offensive in lebanon which they view as disproportionate . the greens ' defense expert , winfried nachtwei , said that germany should stop all arms deliveries to israel , arguing that berlin was guilty of violating binding guidelines on the export of weapons to crisis areas .
he added that any deliveries of weapons to the middle east were politically harmful and not conducive to ending the conflict . for the first time , a leading member of the central council of jews in germany , rolf verleger , has also heavily criticized israel 's strategy , branding it a policy of violence .
he said that the jewish state was killing 10 lebanese for every one israeli killed and was destroying the infrastructure of a whole country indiscriminately . the central council of jews was quick to respond , saying verleger 's remarks were those of an individual and did not represent the views of the council as a whole . moral a n d historical reaso n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patriot systems in israel in 2003 german arms deliveries to israel have a long tradition .
as early as 1964 , german patrol boats and used tanks were sent to israel .
in 1991 , german patriot anti missile defense systems protected the israeli population against iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's scud missiles .
while germany opposed the us-led war against iraq in 2003 , patriot systems were again sent to israel . " in the interest of israeli security and the security of its citizens and for moral and historical reasons , we will help , " then chancellor gerhard schröder said at the time . deliveri n g weapo n s parts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli helicopters use german technology but the delivery of complete arms systems has been the exception .
germany mainly sends weapon components and technology that helps israel to build weapons themselves .
some parts of the merkava tank , such as the armoring and the gun , come from germany , as do the engine and the transmission .
the same is true for engines of israeli speed boats as well as systems used in helicopters . while the us delivers major weapons systems in the form of planes and helicopters such as f-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters , which are used in lebanon .
they also contain german technology , including infrared modules needed to hone in on targets . between 1998 and 2000 , germany also delivered three dolphin submarines to israel that were largely paid for by german taxpayers .
two more submarine sales have been approved , according to ottfried nassauer of the information center for trans-atlantic security in berlin . " needless to say , the submarines are armed , " he added .
" they contain torpedoes , ship-to-ship missiles and can carry mines .
they can carry long-range missiles that would allow israel to store its nuclear weapons out of harms way in the sea . " co n cer n s about use bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli tank in the west bank town of nablus in 2001 but germany also rejects delivery requests for some weapons systems because they could be used against palestinians . " israel does n't get weapons that could obviously be used to combat palestinian rioters , " nassauer said , adding that israel has unsuccessfully tried to get an armed vehicle called dingo , which can be used in densely populated areas to transport soldiers safely .
israel wants 103 vehicles . " but at the end of june , the government approved the delivery of a test dingo , " nassauer said , adding that german governments have a history of arguing that it 's in germany 's interest to deliver weapons to israel .

" we were the better team for most of the match but just needed the goal , " lamented hamburg coach thomas doll .
" however we are good away from home too so all is not lost and we have to go there believing we can win the match and qualify .

" we had no luck tonight but hopefully we will do in spain and if we can keep it tight at the back again we can go through . " osasuna , fourth in the spanish top-flight last season , had their first opening in the 23rd minute when roberto soldado blasted a shot at sascha kirschstein 's legs . the spanish visitors then had the ball in the net through veteran striker savo milosevic four minutes from the interval but the effort was ruled out for offside . two minutes into the second half ivory coast attacker boubacar sanogo missed a glorious chance to put hamburg ahead from just five yards . serbia international milosevic , who has over 100 caps for his country , then missed a sitter for osasuna on the hour fluffing his left-footed shot meters from the goal line . the misses contributed to a scoreless draw which osasuna will certainly be happier with . tie " evenly poised " for return leg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honors even : hsv will have to do it all again in spain " i think it is evenly poised as hamburg are strong away from home , " said osasuna coach angel ziganda .

"
police arrested 21 people in the uk as the incident once again raised questions about the level of threat europe faces from terrorism since the september 2001 attacks in new york and washington .
" this is certainly not just a british problem , but affects all europeans who are grappling with the problem of homegrown terrorism , " said berndt georg thamm , an expert on terrorism . not the only attack foiled ? " reality has caught up with us after the world cup , " said klaus jansen , head of germany 's criminal investigators ' union . -lrb- bdk -rrb- .
" whether it 's the two bombs found in dortmund and koblenz on the rail network -lrb- earlier this month -rrb- or the current attack in england , it shows that there 's a constant latent threat , " janssen said .

that 's because grapes there regularly get pampered in a special way to produce a happy , relaxed wine . florian meierott 's a busy man .
the german violinist has just returned from a tour of japan and korea , he 's playing in london on friday , followed by concerts in salzburg and barcelona . but in between delighting his international fans , meierott regularly takes time to bring the music of bach , mozart and others to a very different audience : grapes . following the example of others who claim to have found out that classical music increases a cow 's milk production and drawn-out sounds cure horses ' dust allergies , meierott is convinced that his art brings pleasure to silvaner grapes in the northern bavarian town of würzburg . he told german public broadcaster br that it takes him about two hours to cover the entire vineyard , adding that he avoids music that 's overly dramatic . happy grapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budding wine charmers ?
vintner michael jansen seems to think that meierott 's efforts are paying off . " the grapes seem to be very relaxed and very happy , " he said , adding that they 're bound to turn into a relaxed wine . it 's hard to imagine what a stressed out wine would taste like and jansen 's grapes have so far refused to comment on whether they 're really enjoying the serenades . but apart from open-air rehearsal time , at least meierott 's getting something out of it : each year , jansen dedicates part of his wine production to his fiddling friend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for more quirky stories from germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.08.2006 controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a silesian boy crouches in front of the remants of his family 's home in 1945 organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday . called " paths unchosen , " the exhibition in the stately kro n pri n ze n palais , which served as a state palace under the prussians , in downtown berlin documents the fates of millions of war refugees in europe in the 20th century .
exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .
" we want to show that it is no way unique .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.08.2006 controversial exhibition on postwar expulsions opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a silesian boy crouches in front of the remants of his family 's home in 1945 organized by the conservative german league of expellees , a controversial exhibition highlighting forced migration , displacement and genocide in europe in the 20th century opens its doors in berlin thursday . called " paths unchosen , " the exhibition in the stately kro n pri n ze n palais , which served as a state palace under the prussians , in downtown berlin documents the fates of millions of war refugees in europe in the 20th century .
exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .
" we want to show that it is no way unique .

schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd . " excelle n ce as competitive adva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans keep shipping their products overseas germany 's labor costs are on par with those of its trading partners and competitors , horn said , adding that one must also look at a country 's productivity . " germany is a leader in exports , " jung said .
" that would not be possible if labor costs were too high here . " the iw 's schröder begged to differ . " high labor costs do indeed put a country or business region under pressure , " he said .
" many companies manufacture elsewhere .
german businesses must try to balance it out by offering top-quality products and high-precision technology tailored to the needs of their customers .

exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.08.2006 debating the damage of high labor costs for german business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german standards have a high price a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .
other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .

" you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd .

" that would not be possible if labor costs were too high here . " the iw 's schröder begged to differ . " high labor costs do indeed put a country or business region under pressure , " he said .

exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .

exhibits range from memorabilia , photographs , books , maps , video footage , eye-witness accounts and historical texts . the show stresses the unprepared nature of flights and arbitrary expulsions in the form of an array of battered suitcases , packed boxes and packages containing possessions hastily put together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees in croatia in 1992 personal items include a yellowed photograph showing an old man squatting forlornly amid a background of bullet-riddled walls and waiting to be transported to a refugee camp in croatia , an exquisite violin made in a russian camp , a tiny child 's glove , a big key belonging to the maria church in danzig -lrb- present-day gdansk -rrb- , traditional garb and dirndls and a metal locker from a refugee camp decorated with a rustic floral pattern . the curators traveled all over europe to collect the exhibits .
some are on loan from other museums , while others belong to the ancestors of war refugees . the curators say they do n't want to create a treasure chest full of kitschy items , but rather capture the chaos , upheaval and turbulent transition of the time . " this is no museum for folklore .
it 's about broken biographies , " kathrina klotz , one of the curators , told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g . a n u n critical compariso n of sufferi n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees crowd boats as smyrna is burning in 1922 focusing on the suffering and loss caused by the nazis , the exhibits touch on , among others , the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire in 1915 , the expulsion of christian greeks from the city of smyrna -lrb- today called izmir -rrb- in 1922 , the deportation of poles and italians , muslims from former yugoslavia , jews from vienna and the expulsion of an estimated 12 million germans from countries in eastern europe at the end of world war ii . it 's the latter in particular that lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding the exhibition . though the expulsion of millions of germans from their homelands in present-day eastern europe is a well-documented historical fact and the current show is backed by strong and independent research , many remain skeptical of the exhibition 's concept . critics accuse the organizers , the centre against expulsions - a body closely linked to the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- which is in favor of setting up a controversial european center for expulsions in berlin , of an uncritical comparison of germans ' plight with those of others who suffered under the nazis . a n echo of misplaced n atio n alism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech passport of writer franz werfel , who fled from the nazis for years , the bdv 's plans to establish the controversial center has been viewed with anger and deep suspicion not just within left-wing circles in germany but also by germany 's neighbors , poland and the czech republic - where most of the german expulsions took place . they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the planned center and object to its location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich . the bdv 's consistent emphasis on german suffering at the end of the war has also prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the group is downplaying the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions in the first place .
critics say the group is unilaterally highlighting german suffering , putting it on a par with that of jews and other polish civilians . some 12 million germans were displaced , deported or expelled from countries in eastern and central europe at the end of world ii during the advance of russia 's red army , according to the bdv .
an estimated three million died during the expulsions . referring to the tense mood in poland regarding the bdv 's plans , gesine schwan , the german government 's coordinator for german-polish relations , told deutsche welle that things were n't just black and white . " in this case the germans were the perpetrators and the poles the victims , and perpetrators have the tendency to blame victims for what happened to themselves , " said schwan , the president of viadrina university in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border and a former candidate for the german presidency . germa n expulsio n s " n ot u n ique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach -lrb- picture -rrb- is also a member of parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union however , erika steinbach , a deeply controversial german politician and director of the bdv insists that the exhibition is committed to cover the plight of all european refugees . " if you think in terms of human rights , then the fate of each individual and the dignity of each person must be preserved , " steinbach told deutsche welle .
" and in the end , it was collective punishment that drastically violated international law . " klotz , one of the curators of the show , also stressed that the exhibition was meant in no way to disproportionately highlight german suffering . " for us the most important thing is to contextualize the expulsion of germans , " klotz told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g .
" we want to show that it is no way unique .

other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average . there was a time when some people used to think of germany as something akin to a land of milk and honey - perhaps the european version of the united states : where dreams can come true and much money can be made . if the cologne institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- has anything to say about it , one of its economists will tell you that labor costs for german workers are a turnoff to foreign investors . according to a recently released study by iw economist christoph schröder , manufacturing companies in western germany , where wages are still higher than in the former communist eastern part of the country , paid 27.87 euros -lrb- $ 35.84 -rrb- an hour for their workers in 2005 . study says us perso n n el costs are lower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese workers cost less than their german counterparts compare that to the united states and japan , where employees in the manufacturing sector cost 19.27 euros and 18.60 euros per hour respectively , according to the iw study .
it also reported that other nations competing with germany , such as italy , great britain and france , pay labor costs of between 18 and 21 euros . " that puts western germany at a disadvantage when it comes to foreign investors considering this area , " schröder said . western germany is only better off than norway -lrb- 29.45 euros an hour -rrb- and denmark -lrb- 28.33 euros -rrb- , schröder 's study said . labor costs consist of wages and personnel costs -lrb- or social benefits and taxes -rrb- that employers must pay .
schröder 's study reported that western german manufacturing employers pay nearly double in personnel costs of what us manufacturing employers pay . schröder said even eastern german manufacturing businesses are at an advantage over western ones since the former pay only 17.37 euros in hourly labor costs for an employee .
the east therefore draws the business , he concluded . readi n g betwee n the li n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this worker in hungary gets significantly less money but other experts cautioned that such studies have to be studied carefully . " you have to read the fine print , " said rainer jung , the spokesman for the macroeconomic policy institute -lrb- imk -rrb- in düsseldorf . jung 's institute , the imk , released a study in june that showed that labor costs for germany as a whole stood at 26.20 euros an hour in 2004 - making them mid-level compared to 15 other european union countries . the imk study shows that hourly labor costs in germany are lower than those in most northern and western european countries , including denmark , sweden , belgium , luxemburg , france , the netherlands and finland . it is countries like hungary and the czech republic where labor costs in general are much lower than germany 's .
employers in poland paid average hourly labor costs of 4.70 euros in 2004 in the manufacturing and service sectors . absurd claims ? furthermore , the imk study did n't only look at the manufacturing industry , jung said . " we also took the private service sector into account - which includes everyone from a business consultant to a waitress , " he said . jung added that labor costs in the manufacturing industry are generally higher than in the service sector , so figures are bound to differ . in the end , said gustav horn , imk 's scientific director in a statement , " our figures show that the notion that germany has a hard time competing on the global or its own market because of high labor costs is absurd . " excelle n ce as competitive adva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans keep shipping their products overseas germany 's labor costs are on par with those of its trading partners and competitors , horn said , adding that one must also look at a country 's productivity . " germany is a leader in exports , " jung said .
" that would not be possible if labor costs were too high here . " the iw 's schröder begged to differ . " high labor costs do indeed put a country or business region under pressure , " he said .
" many companies manufacture elsewhere .
german businesses must try to balance it out by offering top-quality products and high-precision technology tailored to the needs of their customers .

ken masters , a captain in the royal military police , died in basra last october .
his wife , alison , said his death " could have been prevented " if he had received more support .
mrs masters said she wanted to discuss his case with the ministry of defence , but has not been given an appointment .
captain masters , 40 , died just five days before he was due to leave iraq .
he was the father of two girls who are now 14 and 12 .
alison masters said her husband loved his job , but was under extreme pressure working in iraq .
captain masters served in basra " we are asking far too much of our troops , they are working 24/7 without any help , " she said .
" they are overstretched and attitudes need to be changed .
" depression is an illness , but they really need to look at the stress and having somebody out there to look after them . "
she said her husband 's colleagues had noticed he was not well , but " nothing was done for him " .
concerns " if someone had done something , or if there had been something in place , ken would be here , " she said .
mrs masters has requested a meeting with the ministry of defence to discuss her concerns , but no appointment has been fixed .
she said she is also disappointed that she has not heard from prime minister tony blair .
" he sent them out there so the least he could have done was to write to us to say he was sorry for what happened , " she said .

sir roderick evans will call for more prison places in wales saying families often have to travel long distances to visit relatives in jail .
this endangers family contact which is vital for prisoners ' reintegration into society , the judge will tell a law society event on thursday .
the prison service said it was building more prisons in england and wales .
the call from sir roderick , wales ' most senior judge , comes the same week parc prison in bridgend was criticised for failing inspection tests .
it failed to meet standards on a number of issues , including safety and prisoner work activity .
the judge believes there are " insufficient " prisons for male adults and young offenders .
there are no places at all in wales for female prisoners .
' huge strain ' the judge said : " north of usk there is no prison of any sort in wales .
" the result of this shortage of prison places is that large numbers of prisoners , whose homes are in wales , are sent to prisons long distances from where they and their families live . "
the judge said contact between prisoners and their families was " endangered " by the lack of prisons .
he added : " arrangements for pre-release contact - which is so important for reintegration of prisoners into society - and their eventual rehabilitation is made more difficult . "
one relative , donna jones , from llangefni , said visiting her brother in a prison in liverpool via public transport had put a " huge strain " on the whole family .
she told bbc news it took a bus , two trains and a taxi to get to hmp altcourse in the fazakerley area of the city .
" i 'd have to wait then about an hour for me to be called upon to see my brother and then i got an hour with him in the visitors ' centre , " she said .
sir roderick evans says wales needs more prisons " i 'd try to visit about two o 'clock in the afternoon .
i 'd set off about 9.30 in the morning and i 'd come home maybe 8 o 'clock at night ...

a prison service spokesman said the service was building more capacity in england and wales to meet demand .
" since 1997 we have built 19,000 new prison places and the further 8,000 additional places announced in the review are on top of the 80,400 capacity that we were already committed to by 2007 , " he said .
" the national offender management service will be looking to identify suitable sites in areas of greatest strategic need . "
the spokesman added that the prison service was also being " smarter " about how prison was used and focusing resources on where they would be most effective .

futuresex / lovesounds has been four years in the making , during which time he hit the headlines for playing a part in janet jackson 's infamous " wardrobe malfunction " .
the 25-year-old from tennessee is anxious that the new work will emulate the success of his first offering .
" after the first album did really well , i thought i 'd better not mess a good thing up now there are people waiting , wanting and watching .
" how do you compete with the first album ?
the answer is you do n't - you ca n't recreate a moment .
you have to make a new one , " he says .
' more epic ' timberlake , who started his pop career with boy band n 'sync , was keen to make a record which was " equally progressive " .
" you hear music on the radio and it all tends to sound the same , so you want to push it as far as you can , " says the musician .
" i 'm happy with it .
if justified was dipping a toe in the water , this record is jumping in .
it 's more epic and broad . "
" she 's made a career out of being a chameleon ... but i 'd like to be known as an all-round songwriter " justin timberlake on madonna timberlake 's musical success - and his relationships with britney spears and actress cameron diaz - have made him one of the most recognisable faces on the planet .
the singer is contemplating his long-term future in the industry , with a third album already in mind .
" if i do this for the rest of my life , it will always have to be a challenge .
i do n't know if i 'll do 12-15 albums over the span of my career , but every time i make one i 'll be fully committed to it .
" it 's important to show people different colours if you 're able to do so , " adds the performer .
timberlake considers madonna as an example of musical greatness and longevity , and explores whether his own career could last decades .
' off the cuff ' " she 's made a career out of being a chameleon .
she puts the right people in the room and is a great executive producer of her albums and her image , " he says .
" but i 'd like to be known as an all-round songwriter .
i put my image together after i 've made the music .
" madonna is a lot smarter than i am , deciding she wants to go , say , disco .
i have trouble being so specific .
with me it flows from the gut and off the cuff a little more . "
timberlake adds that a madonna-like ability to deliver a finished package may come as he advances in years , but feels his career must offer " more than one sound " .
" for music to really sink beneath people 's skin , you have to take time away , really craft it and make it something special , " he says .
the singer , who sold two million copies of his first album in the uk alone , calls it " a home away from home " , and applauds british music as being the " most fashionable and forward-thinking since the beginning of rock 'n'roll " .
and he praises the arctic monkeys , saying it would certainly be a " departure " if his music was influenced by the british rock band .
" because i do something else , i like listening to things that i do n't do . "
futuresex / lovesounds is released in the uk on 11 september , preceded by new single sexyback on 28 august .

french game maker nevrax is releasing tools that let players craft and run their own sophisticated scenarios set in the ryzom game world .
the scenario creation kit can be used to create quests for other players to complete and , once written , edited and uploaded , will become part of the larger game that anyone can play .
creators of scenarios can either choose to adventure through the setting of their own devising or act as an overseer and make it more or less difficult for any player or group passing through it .
god game the saga of ryzom is an online game set in a world that fuses science-fiction with more well-known fantasy elements .
players can be one of four humanoid races and venture round the game world of planet atys which has been torn apart by an apocalyptical war headed by smart insects called kitins .
like many other online role-playing games those who venture around the world gain experience by battling hostile creatures and gaining loot and completing a variety of tasks they are set by computer controlled characters .
the ryzom ring scenario creation kit is a free add-on for the game .
" it 's about getting the tools to the players to make their own content inside the game , " said nevrax director francois " milko " berset .
mr berset said no programming expertise was needed to create scenarios as all the elements for a customised adventure were usable via a series of mouse-driven menus .
using this system , scenario creators can pick their terrain , dress it with appropriate flora and fauna and then set up a complicated series of events , triggers and items for those that play the setting .
to start with , a set of 200 empty maps has been created for scenario designers to use as the base for their creations but mr berset said more would be available soon .
in a demonstration for the bbc news website , mr berset showed how to create a quest involving an attack on a bandit camp that acted as a distraction so a player could liberate some useful supplies .
the actions of the central player determined whether the camp was attacked head on or if the attackers took advantage of terrain to outflank the bandits .
tool time everything from the aggression levels of hostile creatures to when to schedule rain can be set up via the scenario creation kit .
adventure-writers can set traps for players , schedule events so hostile creatures attack when certain conditions are met or chain events so when one element of the scenario is finished the next stage opens up .
mr berset said scenario writers could join other players as they adventure in the customised map .
alternatively they could act as an overseer and tweak events if players struggled to defeat hostiles , missed clues or otherwise struggled to complete the section .
" the tools are completely integrated into the game , " said mr berset .
once scenarios are completed they can be uploaded so others can try them out .
each scenario can support about 50 concurrent players and up to 200 computer controlled monsters or humanoids .
in some respects the player-created scenarios will act like the " instances " - or standalone adventure sections of other online games such as world of warcraft .
nevrax is working on a system that will try to stop players using custom-built scenarios as a training ground to make their characters very powerful so they have an easier time in the larger game world .
nevrax hopes the final system will encourage players to spend time in both places .

french game maker nevrax is releasing tools that let players craft and run their own sophisticated scenarios set in the ryzom game world .
the scenario creation kit can be used to create quests for other players to complete and , once written , edited and uploaded , will become part of the larger game that anyone can play .
creators of scenarios can either choose to adventure through the setting of their own devising or act as an overseer and make it more or less difficult for any player or group passing through it .
god game the saga of ryzom is an online game set in a world that fuses science-fiction with more well-known fantasy elements .
players can be one of four humanoid races and venture round the game world of planet atys which has been torn apart by an apocalyptical war headed by smart insects called kitins .
like many other online role-playing games those who venture around the world gain experience by battling hostile creatures and gaining loot and completing a variety of tasks they are set by computer controlled characters .
the ryzom ring scenario creation kit is a free add-on for the game .
the tool lets creators set up complicated interactions " it 's about getting the tools to the players to make their own content inside the game , " said nevrax director francois " milko " berset .
mr berset said no programming expertise was needed to create scenarios as all the elements for a customised adventure were usable via a series of mouse-driven menus .
using this system , scenario creators can pick their terrain , dress it with appropriate flora and fauna and then set up a complicated series of events , triggers and items for those that play the setting .
to start with , a set of 200 empty maps has been created for scenario designers to use as the base for their creations but mr berset said more would be available soon .
in a demonstration for the bbc news website , mr berset showed how to create a quest involving an attack on a bandit camp that acted as a distraction so a player could liberate some useful supplies .
the actions of the central player determined whether the camp was attacked head on or if the attackers took advantage of terrain to outflank the bandits .
tool time everything from the aggression levels of hostile creatures to when to schedule rain can be set up via the scenario creation kit .
adventure-writers can set traps for players , schedule events so hostile creatures attack when certain conditions are met or chain events so when one element of the scenario is finished the next stage opens up .
planet atys is home to many strange beasts mr berset said scenario writers could join other players as they adventure in the customised map .
alternatively they could act as an overseer and tweak events if players struggled to defeat hostiles , missed clues or otherwise struggled to complete the section .
" the tools are completely integrated into the game , " said mr berset .
once scenarios are completed they can be uploaded so others can try them out .
each scenario can support about 50 concurrent players and up to 200 computer controlled monsters or humanoids .
in some respects the player-created scenarios will act like the " instances " - or standalone adventure sections of other online games such as world of warcraft .
nevrax is working on a system that will try to stop players using custom-built scenarios as a training ground to make their characters very powerful so they have an easier time in the larger game world .
nevrax hopes the final system will encourage players to spend time in both places .

french game maker nevrax is releasing tools that let players craft and run their own sophisticated scenarios set in the ryzom game world .
the scenario creation kit can be used to create quests for other players to complete and , once written , edited and uploaded , will become part of the larger game that anyone can play .
creators of scenarios can either choose to adventure through the setting of their own devising or act as an overseer and make it more or less difficult for any player or group passing through it .
god game the saga of ryzom is an online game set in a world that fuses science-fiction with more well-known fantasy elements .
players can be one of four humanoid races and venture round the game world of planet atys which has been torn apart by an apocalyptical war headed by smart insects called kitins .
like many other online role-playing games those who venture around the world gain experience by battling hostile creatures and gaining loot and completing a variety of tasks they are set by computer controlled characters .
the ryzom ring scenario creation kit is a free add-on for the game .
the tool lets creators set up complicated interactions " it 's about getting the tools to the players to make their own content inside the game , " said nevrax director francois " milko " berset .
mr berset said no programming expertise was needed to create scenarios as all the elements for a customised adventure were usable via a series of mouse-driven menus .
using this system , scenario creators can pick their terrain , dress it with appropriate flora and fauna and then set up a complicated series of events , triggers and items for those that play the setting .
to start with , a set of 200 empty maps has been created for scenario designers to use as the base for their creations but mr berset said more would be available soon .
in a demonstration for the bbc news website , mr berset showed how to create a quest involving an attack on a bandit camp that acted as a distraction so a player could liberate some useful supplies .
the actions of the central player determined whether the camp was attacked head on or if the attackers took advantage of terrain to outflank the bandits .
tool time everything from the aggression levels of hostile creatures to when to schedule rain can be set up via the scenario creation kit .
adventure-writers can set traps for players , schedule events so hostile creatures attack when certain conditions are met or chain events so when one element of the scenario is finished the next stage opens up .
planet atys is home to many strange beasts mr berset said scenario writers could join other players as they adventure in the customised map .
alternatively they could act as an overseer and tweak events if players struggled to defeat hostiles , missed clues or otherwise struggled to complete the section .
" the tools are completely integrated into the game , " said mr berset .
once scenarios are completed they can be uploaded so others can try them out .
each scenario can support about 50 concurrent players and up to 200 computer controlled monsters or humanoids .
in some respects the player-created scenarios will act like the " instances " - or standalone adventure sections of other online games such as world of warcraft .

glyn davies says arrangements to treat powys patients at robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital -lrb- rjah -rrb- , in shropshire , are in " turmoil " .
powys local health board and rjah are in dispute over funding for the treatment of mid wales patients there .
rjah said it had treated more people from powys than it had been paid for .
the local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- , which is facing a £ 4.8m budget deficit , is in arbitration with rjah over the contractual dispute .
the lhb said it had to pay more for its patients to receive treatment in england , and additional costs had to be managed within its budget .
the specialist said the only way he could treat my wife was if we moved from powys over the border to england reginald wallis the rjah is only a few miles from the border with powys , and about 40 % of its patients are from wales .
one patient affected , joyce wallis , 77 , lives in llanfyllin - 15 miles from the hospital .
mrs wallis , who may need major hip surgery , now fears she may have to travel to south wales for treatment .
her husband reginald , 80 , said she had received treatment at the shropshire hospital for 20 years .
mr wallis said : " we visited a consultant at rjah who my wife has been seeing for years , but he did n't realise we were from powys until the end of our discussion .
" the specialist said the only way he could treat my wife was if we moved from powys to england , because of a disagreement over funding . "
glyn davies says patients ' treatment is suffering sian griffiths , 37 , from newtown , was due to have an operation at rjah , but was told last week it had been cancelled over the dispute .
ms griffiths said she was devastated because she has suffered with back pain for 18 years and relies on crutches and doses of morphine .
conservative mid and west wales am glyn davies , who met powys lhb 's chairman this week , said there were many more patients in the same predicament .
he said : " i am deeply concerned about what is a truly shambolic situation which surrounds the present and future of orthopaedic services in powys .
" powys patients are deeply concerned about what is going to happen to them and whether they will not be treated anything like as quickly as they have the right to expect .
" the future of orthopaedics in powys is in turmoil . "
powys lhb said it had taken control of the orthopaedic waiting list and would decide who was treated and where .
it said some patients would still be seen by doctors at the rjah .
" clinicians will still set the clinical priority , but the patient will be referred through the local health board and not through the district general hospital , " said a spokesman .
the rjah refused to comment about its patients , but a spokeswoman said : " the trust does have the capacity and would wish to treat powys patients .
" however , it can not afford to treat patients it will not get paid for . "
the welsh assembly government said it was aware of the impact english payment policy was having on the nhs in wales .

glyn davies says arrangements to treat powys patients at robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital -lrb- rjah -rrb- , in shropshire , are in " turmoil " .
powys local health board and rjah are in dispute over funding for the treatment of mid wales patients there .
rjah said it had treated more people from powys than it had been paid for .
the local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- , which is facing a £ 4.8m budget deficit , is in arbitration with rjah over the contractual dispute .
the lhb said it had to pay more for its patients to receive treatment in england , and additional costs had to be managed within its budget .
the specialist said the only way he could treat my wife was if we moved from powys over the border to england reginald wallis the rjah is only a few miles from the border with powys , and about 40 % of its patients are from wales .
one patient affected , joyce wallis , 77 , lives in llanfyllin - 15 miles from the hospital .
mrs wallis , who may need major hip surgery , now fears she may have to travel to south wales for treatment .
her husband reginald , 80 , said she had received treatment at the shropshire hospital for 20 years .
mr wallis said : " we visited a consultant at rjah who my wife has been seeing for years , but he did n't realise we were from powys until the end of our discussion .
" the specialist said the only way he could treat my wife was if we moved from powys to england , because of a disagreement over funding . "
glyn davies says patients ' treatment is suffering sian griffiths , 37 , from newtown , was due to have an operation at rjah , but was told last week it had been cancelled over the dispute .
ms griffiths said she was devastated because she has suffered with back pain for 18 years and relies on crutches and doses of morphine .
conservative mid and west wales am glyn davies , who met powys lhb 's chairman this week , said there were many more patients in the same predicament .
he said : " i am deeply concerned about what is a truly shambolic situation which surrounds the present and future of orthopaedic services in powys .
" powys patients are deeply concerned about what is going to happen to them and whether they will not be treated anything like as quickly as they have the right to expect .
" the future of orthopaedics in powys is in turmoil . "
powys lhb said it had taken control of the orthopaedic waiting list and would decide who was treated and where .
it said some patients would still be seen by doctors at the rjah .
" clinicians will still set the clinical priority , but the patient will be referred through the local health board and not through the district general hospital , " said a spokesman .
the rjah refused to comment about its patients , but a spokeswoman said : " the trust does have the capacity and would wish to treat powys patients .
" however , it can not afford to treat patients it will not get paid for . "

the shutdown at the site is expected to cost alaska $ 6.4m -lrb- £ 3.4m -rrb- a day in tax revenues and this has prompted a government state-wide hiring freeze .
the closure followed " numerous " satisfactory maintenance reports from bp , governor frank murkowski said .
he said bp would be " held responsible " for its earlier management of the site .
" bp must get the entire prudhoe bay field back up and running as soon as is safely possible , " he said .
indefinite shutdown the oilfield accounts for 8 % of us domestic production , producing 400,000 barrels a day .
the indefinite shutdown of the oilfield comes at a time when oil markets are already jittery , with the conflict in lebanon keeping prices close to record highs . "
we want to be the gold standard of safety , operations and integrity " dave macdowell , bp spokesman the price of brent crude oil , which hit a new high of $ 78.64 after news of the leak , was trading at $ 77.48 early on thursday .
us light , sweet crude oil was trading at $ 76.46 a barrel on thursday - slightly below its price on monday .
reacting to mr murkowski 's comments , a bp spokesman said : " we want to be the gold standard of safety , operations and integrity . "
the oil giant has said it will replace 16 miles of pipeline at the site after corrosion was discovered on an oil transit line .
this followed a small spill from the pipeline on sunday in which an estimated four to five barrels were lost .
bp is already facing a criminal investigation after a leak from a stretch of pipeline on the site earlier this year resulted in the loss of 267,000 gallons of oil .
bp owns a quarter of prudhoe 's output , the remainder being owned by conocophillips and exxonmobil .

ms royal had an image makeover before launching her election bid according to a spokesman , ms royal " does not want to give the photographs more importance than they deserve " , though she does regard them as a breach of her personal privacy that could be actionable in law .
the pictures were taken by paparazzi who followed ms royal and her partner , socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- first secretary francois hollande , to their holiday spot near la rochelle .
they show her in a turquoise bikini , walking along a beach , swimming and sunbathing on a rubber dinghy .
hollande and the couple 's elder daughter - they have four children - are also shown .
though on one level they are perfectly inoffensive , the photographs have raised hackles in france because they seem to confirm what many see as the growing trivialisation of national politics .
wooing the media up until a couple of years ago , french leaders were protected from press intrusion by the country 's very strict privacy laws .
segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy have both been happy to put their private lives on display when it suited them marc dolisi , editor of vsd magazine a violation of privacy - atteinte à la vie privée - is a criminal offence punishable by a large fine .
some celebrities - such as members of the monaco royal family - make a tidy sum every year from suing the press .
but recently two processes have gone hand-in-hand .
on the one side , the market for " people " magazines in france has sky-rocketed .
there are now more than half a dozen major weeklies - with names like vsd , closer , voici , gala , public - each printing up to half a million copies .
at the same time , with the april 2007 election looming , the two front-runners - ms royal and the right-winger nicolas sarkozy - have both made the same calculation that wooing the popular media is an unavoidable part of modern-day campaigning .
both have arranged for themselves lavish spreads in paris match and other glossies .
mr sarkozy and his wife arranged a " happy-couple " photo shoot mr sarkozy 's long-running marital problems with his wife cecilia have become a soap opera , and their recent reconciliation was the occasion for a succession of happy-couple shoots .
and segolene royal , 53 , who underwent a major image change before launching her presidential bid - what the french call un relooking - has also shown every inclination to court coverage .
that explains why her apparent anger at the latest paparazzi-pops rings pretty hollow .
image politics as marc dolisi , editor of vsd said , " segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy have both been happy to put their private lives on display when it suited them .
it was they who took the first step . "
the development has given rise to a ghastly neologism which is weaselling its way into the french tongue : " la pipolisation " .
le pipol is a misspelling of le people , a word which in french refers not to the man or woman in the street but to the people in the magazines : the stars , the footballers , the royals , the celebs .
according to critics of the way things are going , french politics is pipol -ising : in other words , it is becoming obsessed with the image of individuals , rather than the substance of policy .
it is hard not to see some truth in this , though the process is probably inevitable .

ms royal had an image makeover before launching her election bid according to a spokesman , ms royal " does not want to give the photographs more importance than they deserve " , though she does regard them as a breach of her personal privacy that could be actionable in law .
the pictures were taken by paparazzi who followed ms royal and her partner , socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- first secretary francois hollande , to their holiday spot near la rochelle .
they show her in a turquoise bikini , walking along a beach , swimming and sunbathing on a rubber dinghy .
hollande and the couple 's elder daughter - they have four children - are also shown .
though on one level they are perfectly inoffensive , the photographs have raised hackles in france because they seem to confirm what many see as the growing trivialisation of national politics .
wooing the media up until a couple of years ago , french leaders were protected from press intrusion by the country 's very strict privacy laws .
segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy have both been happy to put their private lives on display when it suited them marc dolisi , editor of vsd magazine a violation of privacy - atteinte à la vie privée - is a criminal offence punishable by a large fine .
some celebrities - such as members of the monaco royal family - make a tidy sum every year from suing the press .
but recently two processes have gone hand-in-hand .
on the one side , the market for " people " magazines in france has sky-rocketed .
there are now more than half a dozen major weeklies - with names like vsd , closer , voici , gala , public - each printing up to half a million copies .
at the same time , with the april 2007 election looming , the two front-runners - ms royal and the right-winger nicolas sarkozy - have both made the same calculation that wooing the popular media is an unavoidable part of modern-day campaigning .
both have arranged for themselves lavish spreads in paris match and other glossies .
mr sarkozy and his wife arranged a " happy-couple " photo shoot mr sarkozy 's long-running marital problems with his wife cecilia have become a soap opera , and their recent reconciliation was the occasion for a succession of happy-couple shoots .
and segolene royal , 53 , who underwent a major image change before launching her presidential bid - what the french call un relooking - has also shown every inclination to court coverage .
that explains why her apparent anger at the latest paparazzi-pops rings pretty hollow .
image politics as marc dolisi , editor of vsd said , " segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy have both been happy to put their private lives on display when it suited them .
it was they who took the first step . "
the development has given rise to a ghastly neologism which is weaselling its way into the french tongue : " la pipolisation " .
le pipol is a misspelling of le people , a word which in french refers not to the man or woman in the street but to the people in the magazines : the stars , the footballers , the royals , the celebs .
according to critics of the way things are going , french politics is pipol -ising : in other words , it is becoming obsessed with the image of individuals , rather than the substance of policy .
it is hard not to see some truth in this , though the process is probably inevitable .

ms royal had an image makeover before launching her election bid according to a spokesman , ms royal " does not want to give the photographs more importance than they deserve " , though she does regard them as a breach of her personal privacy that could be actionable in law .
the pictures were taken by paparazzi who followed ms royal and her partner , socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- first secretary francois hollande , to their holiday spot near la rochelle .
they show her in a turquoise bikini , walking along a beach , swimming and sunbathing on a rubber dinghy .
hollande and the couple 's elder daughter - they have four children - are also shown .
though on one level they are perfectly inoffensive , the photographs have raised hackles in france because they seem to confirm what many see as the growing trivialisation of national politics .
wooing the media up until a couple of years ago , french leaders were protected from press intrusion by the country 's very strict privacy laws .
segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy have both been happy to put their private lives on display when it suited them marc dolisi , editor of vsd magazine a violation of privacy - atteinte à la vie privée - is a criminal offence punishable by a large fine .
some celebrities - such as members of the monaco royal family - make a tidy sum every year from suing the press .
but recently two processes have gone hand-in-hand .
on the one side , the market for " people " magazines in france has sky-rocketed .
there are now more than half a dozen major weeklies - with names like vsd , closer , voici , gala , public - each printing up to half a million copies .
at the same time , with the april 2007 election looming , the two front-runners - ms royal and the right-winger nicolas sarkozy - have both made the same calculation that wooing the popular media is an unavoidable part of modern-day campaigning .
both have arranged for themselves lavish spreads in paris match and other glossies .
mr sarkozy and his wife arranged a " happy-couple " photo shoot mr sarkozy 's long-running marital problems with his wife cecilia have become a soap opera , and their recent reconciliation was the occasion for a succession of happy-couple shoots .
and segolene royal , 53 , who underwent a major image change before launching her presidential bid - what the french call un relooking - has also shown every inclination to court coverage .
that explains why her apparent anger at the latest paparazzi-pops rings pretty hollow .
image politics as marc dolisi , editor of vsd said , " segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy have both been happy to put their private lives on display when it suited them .
it was they who took the first step . "
the development has given rise to a ghastly neologism which is weaselling its way into the french tongue : " la pipolisation " .
le pipol is a misspelling of le people , a word which in french refers not to the man or woman in the street but to the people in the magazines : the stars , the footballers , the royals , the celebs .
according to critics of the way things are going , french politics is pipol -ising : in other words , it is becoming obsessed with the image of individuals , rather than the substance of policy .
it is hard not to see some truth in this , though the process is probably inevitable .
laurence piau , editor of closer magazine , put it succinctly if ungrammatically : " today segolene royal is un people . "

three members of the ruling party joined the opposition to vote against the proposal , but it still passed by 78 to 62 .
the bill now goes to the senate .
the vote constituted the most serious challenge to the prime minister 's authority during his 10 years in power .

a recent decision to accept about 40 papuan asylum seekers angered jakarta , which said that by giving the group refugee visas , the australians were showing tacit support for papuan independence .

the parliamentary debate triggered a clash between opposition party leader kim beazley and liberal lawmaker wilson tuckey .
mr tuckey asked why labor was keen to " kill off legislation that the australian people want " and mr beazley responded by calling the law a " weak , worthless piece of legislation " .
he then urged mr tuckey to take his " weak , worthless self " off , prompting mr tuckey to call him a " big fat so and so " .

the all-party defence committee said the soldiers needed more helicopters and better-protected patrol vehicles to shield them from roadside bombs .
committee members visited iraq in june and also say operations in afghanistan are being done on a " shoe string " .
defence secretary des browne insisted that british forces in the country were " stretched , but not overstretched " .
and he claimed that many of the equipment problems were being dealt with .
committee chairman james arbuthnot , a conservative mp , said the troops now faced a " significantly higher threat " in southern iraq .
" we can not send them on operations without giving them the tools they need to do the job .
the mod must address equipment shortages and capability gaps as a matter of urgency . "
mr arbuthnot told bbc radio 4 's today programme his committee had also recently visited british troops in afghanistan and had similar concerns there .
" there was a feeling that the whole thing was being done on a shoe string and that we are not spending enough money on the troops we are putting into danger , and that we are asking -lsb- them -rsb- to do extremely difficult things on our behalf , " he said .
' courage and dedication ' the mps said their research had raised fundamental questions over whether the armed forces were structured , trained and equipped to fulfil their role . "
the land rovers were not designed for the job they 're doing now " col bob stewart former army commander at-a-glance : defence report q & a : snatch land rovers they promised to return to those questions in the future .
bbc security and defence correspondent rob watson labelled it a " remarkably critical report " from a " usually constrained " committee .
mr browne said he welcomed the scrutiny , adding : " i am glad the committee recognises the professionalism , courage and dedication of our people in iraq .
" on helicopters , we have a long-term programme to increase operational availability levels - and we continue to explore ways of meeting short-term needs . "
' appalling ' the mps were particularly concerned with the use of snatch land rovers , which have been deemed " ineffective " against the more sophisticated roadside bombs .
they said the land rovers were originally designed for use in northern ireland and offered " far too little protection " against the increasingly sophisticated roadside bombs seen in iraq .
mr browne ordered an urgent review of them after a number of soldiers were killed .
and the ministry of defence is sending extra cougar vehicles .
mr arbuthnot said this was good news but they were not ideal and the government had not acted quickly enough . "

" it 's been appalling that so many of our soldiers have suffered as a result of roadside bombs and these snatch land rovers , " he said .
" the land rovers were not designed for the job they 're doing now . "
liberal democrat defence spokesman nick harvey said equipment and capability shortages in iraq could " prove fatal and must be urgently addressed " .
