those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .
but she also added that europeans had to look beyond fossil fuels to meet their future energy needs . " we have to get away from oil and gas and push renewable energies , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom threat rekindles eu concerns russian energy giant gazprom 's threats to reduce supplies to the eu has triggered debate about building non-russian pipelines within the bloc to transport gas from other sources .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .
during last year 's winter semester , students from 79 nations were enrolled at the university - a considerably higher percentage than in other german universities .

a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .
frankfurt was chosen as the location on account of its accessibility , its proximity to the sea and - perhaps more surprisingly - the fact it was then surrounded by vineyards .
the university was organized into four faculties , law , theology , philosophy , and medicine , and enjoyed an excellent reputation in brandenburg and the surrounding regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalist and scientist alexander von humboldt it soon built up a reputation as a bastion of tolerance , gaining independence from local politics and exempting its students from both tax contributions and military service .
as the various churches vied for prominence over subsequent centuries , the viadrina remained characterized by religious tolerance , withstanding the effects of the reformation in the 1530s and becoming , by the early 17th century , a strongly calvinist university even though the theology faculty retained a lutheran department .
in its heyday , it was a stronghold of humanism and enlightened values , spawning generations of high-profile graduates who went on to become diplomats , lawyers and high-ranking members of the military .

the arch of the main entrance has been preserved as a monument .
international in 1991 , the university was re-established as viadrina european university , comprising three faculties : economics and business studies ; law ; and cultural studies .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .

a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .
frankfurt was chosen as the location on account of its accessibility , its proximity to the sea and - perhaps more surprisingly - the fact it was then surrounded by vineyards .

as the various churches vied for prominence over subsequent centuries , the viadrina remained characterized by religious tolerance , withstanding the effects of the reformation in the 1530s and becoming , by the early 17th century , a strongly calvinist university even though the theology faculty retained a lutheran department .
in its heyday , it was a stronghold of humanism and enlightened values , spawning generations of high-profile graduates who went on to become diplomats , lawyers and high-ranking members of the military .

the arch of the main entrance has been preserved as a monument .
international in 1991 , the university was re-established as viadrina european university , comprising three faculties : economics and business studies ; law ; and cultural studies .
a prime focus of the educational program was to attract students from throughout europe in order to create a multi-national student body .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2006 opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praskoviya nezhyvova holds a portrait of her son who died in the chernobyl nuclear explosion the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism . chernobyl was a catalyst which unleashed forces of historical dimensions .
those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .
-lrb- april 18 , 2006 -rrb- remembering chernobyl twenty years ago , the world was confronted with the dangers of atomic energy after a meltdown at the chernobyl nuclear power plant .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .

" unfortunately , we come up against methods of unfair competition on the world market , " putin said , reiterating earlier comments by russian energy officials who had threatened to intensify business with asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and russian companies are currently building a gas pipeline " despite the high demand for energy resources , we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext , " putin said .
" we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process . " tensions between russia and the european union over energy policy have been on the rise this year after gas supplies to europe were disrupted in january when russia briefly cut supplies over a pricing dispute to ukraine , where pipelines that serve europe are located . since then russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , which provides around one-fourth of the gas supply to europe , has warned that it expects to compete in european energy markets on the same terms as other companies .
gazprom has however declined to open its own monopoly to foreign competition . good chemistry ?

" we talked about molecules , " she told putin afterwards . " i hope that our chemistry will also generate a good atmosphere , " a smiling putin responded . but merkel , a trained physicist whose husband is a chemist , was not to be won over so easily . " it 's a little more complicated than complex molecules , " she rejoined , cautiously . after their first round of talks , putin described the meeting as " intensive " while merkel talked about a " broad strategic cooperation . "
they did not reveal details of the talks . discussi n g ira n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is not giving up his nuclear goals officials from both countries said that diplomatic efforts to check iran 's nuclear program would also be addressed by the two leaders on thursday . germany is one of three eu countries - with britain and france - that back the united states in calls for quick and strong action by the un security council aimed at compelling iran to halt its uranium enrichment activities . however russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear reactor , has said it will oppose efforts to impose international sanctions on tehran until it has seen concrete proof that iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de project fuels german fears of energy dependency on russia as german and russian leaders meet on wednesday , energy giants from both countries will close a deal on developing a russian gas field .

" we think that after sept.11 , extraordinary renditions were not rare , but a practice that was very well known and wide-spread geographically , " said fava , an italian socialist . european parliamentarians decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations in january in parallel to a separate probe by the strasbourg-based council of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us plane in romania washington has come under intense fire in the last few months after reports about hundreds of cia flights , suspected of carrying undeclared prisoners across european airspace , since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks . because they do not have the authority to require individuals to appear before the committee , the eu lawmakers are relying on voluntary hearings and publicly available information . fava said that such voluntary hearings had confirmed that the cia was " clearly responsible for the abduction and the detention of terrorists on the member states ' territory . " italy , swede n , bos n ia i n volved ? in a draft report to be submitted to other eu lawmakers in june , fava singled out eu member states italy and sweden as well as bosnia , which harbors ambitions to join the 25-nation bloc one day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio fava fava said that it was " improbable that the abduction of egyptian cleric abu omar on feb.17 , 2003 in milan by cia agents was organized and carried out without the previous knowledge of italian authorities and security service . " he also criticized swedish authorities for " turning egyptians mohammed al zary and ahmed agiza over to cia agents in order to repatriate them to egypt knowing very well about the risks of torture . " fava also slammed bosnian authorities for ignoring warnings of the bosnian human rights chamber in 2002 and transferring six algerian residents to the united states , which has since sent them to the controversial detention center in guantanamo , cuba . exami n i n g al-masri case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid al-masri testifying in strasbourg in march members of the parliament 's committee investigating the cia flights are to head to macedonia on thursday and friday to look into the case of khaled al-masri , a german of lebanese origin , who accuses the cia of having kidnapped him at the end of 2003 and interrogated him in afghanistan . they are also to visit the united states on a may 8-12 trip , although it is uncertain who will agree to see them there . eu foreign policy chief javier solana has agreed to meet with the lawmakers on may 2 and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has also agreed to an interview . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany accused of accepting information gained under torture a former british ambassador to uzbekistan turned up the heat on germany thursday when he told a european parliament committee that germany had received information " most certainly obtained under torture " in uzbekistan .

making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner .

together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela .

one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .

" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .

or will he go back to his old flame , nathalie ?
at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .
she helped develop the roles of ansgar , tanja and co . , creating delicate blossoms of romance , and then stamping them into the ground through various intrigues and plot twists . paths to happi n ess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what path will bianca choose in her search for happiness ?
making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner . "
together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela . " there , the conflicts mainly center around wealth - rich versus poor .
but that does n't work so well in a german series , " tjia said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrequited love is the main theme of telenovela " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- in love in berlin -rrb- but there is one common problem faced by series writers the world over : they have to produce masses of text in a very short time .
one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .
but in a series , that would blow the whole budget . " spinning exciting stories without the special effects is the craft of the storyliner , she said . tjia , for one , is not worried about a lack of ideas . " something new is always going on in my neighborhood , or among my friends , " she said .
" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .
" it 's a lot more demanding and complex than watching the shows . " tjia 's already secured herself a contract as a junior storyliner on " verbotene liebe . "
starting in june , she 'll once again have a hand in steering the chaotic love lives of the series ' characters . bad boy appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram grandezka plays bad boy ansgar in " verbotene liebe " " i feel pretty close to these characters by now , " she said .
" just the other day i caught myself talking about tanja and nathalie - as if they were real people . " her favorite character , though , is success-hungry businessman ansgar von lahnstein , the male villain . " the evil side of his character means there 's a lot of potential , " tjia said .
" in writing his role i can explore my own mean streak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2006 east , west germany dealt differently with chernobyl großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tagesschau report on the fires in chernobyl following the reactor meltdown in chernobyl , information did n't flow - it trickled .
while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .
at 9 p.m. that evening , moscow officially announced to the world that an " accident " had taken place at the chernobyl power station . too little , too late news spread quickly , but information was thin .
the first reports in west german media came as a short news brief in the evening news . " our correspondent in moscow reported about the accident , but there was no information about any potential danger , " jan hofer , a newscaster that evening for tagestheme n , the nightly news report of german public broadcaster ard , told fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g .
" we had no idea what a gau was - a nuclear worst case scenario - there was little information to go on and no images .
the fear came later , as the bad news was made public . " no milk , n o mushrooms , n o playi n g outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings against fresh milk held in the weeks following the accident west german politicians went into an uproar against the soviet union , condemning its lax safety measures and the concealment of the potential threat of radiation .
but the soviet authorities maintained tight control of information in and around chernobyl , only releasing sketchy details about the cause and extent of the accident . within less than two days , the wind changed and the radioactive cloud dropped poisoned rain on bavaria .
news coverage in west germany turned to the danger of contamination for the german public .
people in bavaria were told to stay indoors as much as possible .
the government issued warnings for german citizens to refrain from eating salads and forest mushrooms and drinking milk . the young political party , the greens , quickly staged protest rallies , carrying banners bearing the slogan " chernobyl is everywhere . "
in television , politicians debated about the future of nuclear energy in west germany .
nuclear power was no longer considered " safe energy . " " cher n obyl n o da n ger for the gdr " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster gave new wind to germany 's antinuclear movement in east germany , the state-controlled media remained loyal to its soviet partners .
the news broadcast aktuelle kamera issued the initial news statement about the meltdown simultaneously to the west german media .
but it was called an " incident , " not a complete meltdown .
in the days that followed , the focus was on downplaying chernobyl - both in its extremity and in the potential danger for east german citizens .
on the evening of may 1 , a panel of nuclear scientists spoke on east german television . " the east german experts tried to reassure people , " said hardy graupner , a reporter for dw-radio 's english service who worked for radio berlin international in east berlin in 1986 .
" but the information was contradictory .
they said it was a russian problem , that east germany was n't affected by contamination and that our nuclear power plants in greifswald were of a younger generation , and therefore completely safe . " if anything , graupner said , it gave east germans the chance to look down on their big brother , the soviet union . " the chernobyl reactor that exploded was old , " he said .
" experts said that the soviets should have modernized it .
the consensus was that east german technology was more sophisticated .
they said that a nuclear meltdown could never happen in the gdr . " clueless u n til 1990 east german newspapers also downplayed the explosion . " experts say : no danger from chernobyl in east germany , " read the headlines in saxony 's newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , the next day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the mushrooms in turingia safer than in bavaria ?
" it was a two-column article on page six , " thomas schade , an editor at the paper , told dw-world.de.
" that was typical for the gdr - the story did n't make the front page because that was full of coverage of the government 's official may day parades . " saxony was one of the few regions in east germany with little access to western media . " we were dependent on expert opinions , " schade said .
" there were n't any official warnings about not eating fresh vegetables or drinking milk , and so in saxony , we were n't very concerned .
it was n't until after the reunification in 1990 that we found out the real extent of the catastrophe .

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .
at 9 p.m. that evening , moscow officially announced to the world that an " accident " had taken place at the chernobyl power station . too little , too late news spread quickly , but information was thin .
the first reports in west german media came as a short news brief in the evening news . " our correspondent in moscow reported about the accident , but there was no information about any potential danger , " jan hofer , a newscaster that evening for tagestheme n , the nightly news report of german public broadcaster ard , told fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g .
" we had no idea what a gau was - a nuclear worst case scenario - there was little information to go on and no images .
the fear came later , as the bad news was made public . " no milk , n o mushrooms , n o playi n g outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings against fresh milk held in the weeks following the accident west german politicians went into an uproar against the soviet union , condemning its lax safety measures and the concealment of the potential threat of radiation .
but the soviet authorities maintained tight control of information in and around chernobyl , only releasing sketchy details about the cause and extent of the accident . within less than two days , the wind changed and the radioactive cloud dropped poisoned rain on bavaria .
news coverage in west germany turned to the danger of contamination for the german public .
people in bavaria were told to stay indoors as much as possible .
the government issued warnings for german citizens to refrain from eating salads and forest mushrooms and drinking milk . the young political party , the greens , quickly staged protest rallies , carrying banners bearing the slogan " chernobyl is everywhere . "
in television , politicians debated about the future of nuclear energy in west germany .
nuclear power was no longer considered " safe energy . " " cher n obyl n o da n ger for the gdr " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster gave new wind to germany 's antinuclear movement in east germany , the state-controlled media remained loyal to its soviet partners .
the news broadcast aktuelle kamera issued the initial news statement about the meltdown simultaneously to the west german media .
but it was called an " incident , " not a complete meltdown .
in the days that followed , the focus was on downplaying chernobyl - both in its extremity and in the potential danger for east german citizens .
on the evening of may 1 , a panel of nuclear scientists spoke on east german television . " the east german experts tried to reassure people , " said hardy graupner , a reporter for dw-radio 's english service who worked for radio berlin international in east berlin in 1986 .
" but the information was contradictory .
they said it was a russian problem , that east germany was n't affected by contamination and that our nuclear power plants in greifswald were of a younger generation , and therefore completely safe . " if anything , graupner said , it gave east germans the chance to look down on their big brother , the soviet union . " the chernobyl reactor that exploded was old , " he said .
" experts said that the soviets should have modernized it .
the consensus was that east german technology was more sophisticated .
they said that a nuclear meltdown could never happen in the gdr . " clueless u n til 1990 east german newspapers also downplayed the explosion . " experts say : no danger from chernobyl in east germany , " read the headlines in saxony 's newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , the next day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the mushrooms in turingia safer than in bavaria ?
" it was a two-column article on page six , " thomas schade , an editor at the paper , told dw-world.de.
" that was typical for the gdr - the story did n't make the front page because that was full of coverage of the government 's official may day parades . " saxony was one of the few regions in east germany with little access to western media . " we were dependent on expert opinions , " schade said .
" there were n't any official warnings about not eating fresh vegetables or drinking milk , and so in saxony , we were n't very concerned .
it was n't until after the reunification in 1990 that we found out the real extent of the catastrophe .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .

or will he go back to his old flame , nathalie ?
at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .
she helped develop the roles of ansgar , tanja and co . , creating delicate blossoms of romance , and then stamping them into the ground through various intrigues and plot twists . paths to happi n ess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what path will bianca choose in her search for happiness ?
making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner . "
together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela . " there , the conflicts mainly center around wealth - rich versus poor .
but that does n't work so well in a german series , " tjia said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrequited love is the main theme of telenovela " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- in love in berlin -rrb- but there is one common problem faced by series writers the world over : they have to produce masses of text in a very short time .
one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .
but in a series , that would blow the whole budget . " spinning exciting stories without the special effects is the craft of the storyliner , she said . tjia , for one , is not worried about a lack of ideas . " something new is always going on in my neighborhood , or among my friends , " she said .
" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .
" it 's a lot more demanding and complex than watching the shows . " tjia 's already secured herself a contract as a junior storyliner on " verbotene liebe . "
starting in june , she 'll once again have a hand in steering the chaotic love lives of the series ' characters . bad boy appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram grandezka plays bad boy ansgar in " verbotene liebe " " i feel pretty close to these characters by now , " she said .
" just the other day i caught myself talking about tanja and nathalie - as if they were real people . " her favorite character , though , is success-hungry businessman ansgar von lahnstein , the male villain . " the evil side of his character means there 's a lot of potential , " tjia said .

or will he go back to his old flame , nathalie ?
at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .
she helped develop the roles of ansgar , tanja and co . , creating delicate blossoms of romance , and then stamping them into the ground through various intrigues and plot twists . paths to happi n ess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what path will bianca choose in her search for happiness ?
making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner . "
together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela . " there , the conflicts mainly center around wealth - rich versus poor .
but that does n't work so well in a german series , " tjia said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrequited love is the main theme of telenovela " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- in love in berlin -rrb- but there is one common problem faced by series writers the world over : they have to produce masses of text in a very short time .
one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .
but in a series , that would blow the whole budget . " spinning exciting stories without the special effects is the craft of the storyliner , she said . tjia , for one , is not worried about a lack of ideas . " something new is always going on in my neighborhood , or among my friends , " she said .
" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .
" it 's a lot more demanding and complex than watching the shows . " tjia 's already secured herself a contract as a junior storyliner on " verbotene liebe . "
starting in june , she 'll once again have a hand in steering the chaotic love lives of the series ' characters . bad boy appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram grandezka plays bad boy ansgar in " verbotene liebe " " i feel pretty close to these characters by now , " she said .
" just the other day i caught myself talking about tanja and nathalie - as if they were real people . " her favorite character , though , is success-hungry businessman ansgar von lahnstein , the male villain . " the evil side of his character means there 's a lot of potential , " tjia said .
" in writing his role i can explore my own mean streak .

those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .
during last year 's winter semester , students from 79 nations were enrolled at the university - a considerably higher percentage than in other german universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesine schwan - she could have been president for the last seven years , its president has been gesine schwan , a charismatic political scientist who has long been active in german politics and was chosen by the spd as its nominee for the presidential elections in 2004 , only to be beaten by horst köhler . the university 's best-known graduates include the scholars alexander and wilhelm von humboldt , as well as the philosopher ulrich von hutten , the theologian and political leader thomas müntzer and the writer heinrich von kleist .
a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .
frankfurt was chosen as the location on account of its accessibility , its proximity to the sea and - perhaps more surprisingly - the fact it was then surrounded by vineyards .
the university was organized into four faculties , law , theology , philosophy , and medicine , and enjoyed an excellent reputation in brandenburg and the surrounding regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalist and scientist alexander von humboldt it soon built up a reputation as a bastion of tolerance , gaining independence from local politics and exempting its students from both tax contributions and military service .
as the various churches vied for prominence over subsequent centuries , the viadrina remained characterized by religious tolerance , withstanding the effects of the reformation in the 1530s and becoming , by the early 17th century , a strongly calvinist university even though the theology faculty retained a lutheran department .
in its heyday , it was a stronghold of humanism and enlightened values , spawning generations of high-profile graduates who went on to become diplomats , lawyers and high-ranking members of the military .
turning point despite being plagued by financial problems that persist to this day , the viadrina university continued to flourish , and by the 19th century , it was home to some 55,000 students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university but in 1811 , the founding of the university of berlin , now known as the humboldt university , led to the closure of the frankfurt premises .
the viadrina moved to breslau , where it merged with the existing university , the leopoldina , in order to boost its competitiveness .
the old university building in frankfurt was destroyed in world war ii and finally cleared in the 1960s .
the arch of the main entrance has been preserved as a monument .
international in 1991 , the university was re-established as viadrina european university , comprising three faculties : economics and business studies ; law ; and cultural studies .
a prime focus of the educational program was to attract students from throughout europe in order to create a multi-national student body .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 30 percent of the viadrina 's students come from poland poised between frankfurt and slubice , the university 's location has always been its main strength .
it now maintains close cooperation with the adam mickiewicz university in poznan , poland , with the two universities jointly operating the collegium polonicum , located just opposite the viadrina on the polish side of the oder river .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .

" strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project .

while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs .

russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .
but she also added that europeans had to look beyond fossil fuels to meet their future energy needs . " we have to get away from oil and gas and push renewable energies , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom threat rekindles eu concerns russian energy giant gazprom 's threats to reduce supplies to the eu has triggered debate about building non-russian pipelines within the bloc to transport gas from other sources .

the un mission in the world body 's largest and most costly , but is still thinly stretched , according to un secretary-general kofi annan , who requested the eu 's assistance . the resolution authorized the force to support un troops seeking to stabilize a situation , protect civilians " under imminent threat of physical violence , " help protect the kinshasa airport , ensure the safety and freedom of movement of its own troops , and extract individuals in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the eu force will be based in kinshasa germany , france provide most support germany will contribute about 500 of the 1,250-strong force with another 500 from france while a group of 10 nations complete the force .
eu leaders plan to send 400 to 450 troops to the drc and to keep a further 800 rapidly-deployable troops on standby outside the country , which is struggling to recover from a war that embroiled most of its neighbors and claimed some 4 million lives . the un resolution also called on the drc government to do its utmost " to ensure that the presidential and parliamentary elections are held in accordance with the timetable of the independent electoral commission . " last month , the eu approved the troop deployment , with officials saying the force would have three key tasks : providing security for international observers , securing kinshasa airport , and , if required , " stabilizing potentially critical situations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers will run the eu 's kinshasa headquarters german troops to be based in kinshasa though the mission could involve forces being deployed virtually anywhere in the country , apart from in the east where un forces have a strong base , the german minister of defense franz josef jung told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung that german troops would remain based in kinshasa . " the main aspect of the european mission is based on deterrence , " he told the paper on wednesday , adding that he did not expect german troops to be moved outside the congolese capital . it is hoped that the elections will mark the end of a volatile political transition in the country that began in 2003 after years of civil war . thirty-two candidates , including current drc president joseph kabila , have been provisionally registered to run in the election , the date for which has been repeatedly postponed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .

at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .

making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .

it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .
-lrb- april 25 , 2006 -rrb- " every type of reactor poses a threat " the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de.

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .

" the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.04.2006 love , lust and betrayal : german writers discover the small screen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big emotions on the small screen in " verbotene liebe " will ansgar stay with tanja and her baby ?
or will he go back to his old flame , nathalie ?
at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .
she helped develop the roles of ansgar , tanja and co . , creating delicate blossoms of romance , and then stamping them into the ground through various intrigues and plot twists . paths to happi n ess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what path will bianca choose in her search for happiness ?
making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner . "
together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela . " there , the conflicts mainly center around wealth - rich versus poor .
but that does n't work so well in a german series , " tjia said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrequited love is the main theme of telenovela " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- in love in berlin -rrb- but there is one common problem faced by series writers the world over : they have to produce masses of text in a very short time .
one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .
but in a series , that would blow the whole budget . " spinning exciting stories without the special effects is the craft of the storyliner , she said . tjia , for one , is not worried about a lack of ideas . " something new is always going on in my neighborhood , or among my friends , " she said .
" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .
" it 's a lot more demanding and complex than watching the shows . " tjia 's already secured herself a contract as a junior storyliner on " verbotene liebe . "
starting in june , she 'll once again have a hand in steering the chaotic love lives of the series ' characters . bad boy appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram grandezka plays bad boy ansgar in " verbotene liebe " " i feel pretty close to these characters by now , " she said .
" just the other day i caught myself talking about tanja and nathalie - as if they were real people . " her favorite character , though , is success-hungry businessman ansgar von lahnstein , the male villain . " the evil side of his character means there 's a lot of potential , " tjia said .

or will he go back to his old flame , nathalie ?
at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .
she helped develop the roles of ansgar , tanja and co . , creating delicate blossoms of romance , and then stamping them into the ground through various intrigues and plot twists . paths to happi n ess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what path will bianca choose in her search for happiness ?
making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner . "
together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela . " there , the conflicts mainly center around wealth - rich versus poor .
but that does n't work so well in a german series , " tjia said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrequited love is the main theme of telenovela " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- in love in berlin -rrb- but there is one common problem faced by series writers the world over : they have to produce masses of text in a very short time .
one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .
but in a series , that would blow the whole budget . " spinning exciting stories without the special effects is the craft of the storyliner , she said . tjia , for one , is not worried about a lack of ideas . " something new is always going on in my neighborhood , or among my friends , " she said .
" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .
" it 's a lot more demanding and complex than watching the shows . " tjia 's already secured herself a contract as a junior storyliner on " verbotene liebe . "
starting in june , she 'll once again have a hand in steering the chaotic love lives of the series ' characters . bad boy appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram grandezka plays bad boy ansgar in " verbotene liebe " " i feel pretty close to these characters by now , " she said .
" just the other day i caught myself talking about tanja and nathalie - as if they were real people . " her favorite character , though , is success-hungry businessman ansgar von lahnstein , the male villain . " the evil side of his character means there 's a lot of potential , " tjia said .
" in writing his role i can explore my own mean streak .

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .
at 9 p.m. that evening , moscow officially announced to the world that an " accident " had taken place at the chernobyl power station . too little , too late news spread quickly , but information was thin .
the first reports in west german media came as a short news brief in the evening news . " our correspondent in moscow reported about the accident , but there was no information about any potential danger , " jan hofer , a newscaster that evening for tagestheme n , the nightly news report of german public broadcaster ard , told fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g .
" we had no idea what a gau was - a nuclear worst case scenario - there was little information to go on and no images .
the fear came later , as the bad news was made public . " no milk , n o mushrooms , n o playi n g outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings against fresh milk held in the weeks following the accident west german politicians went into an uproar against the soviet union , condemning its lax safety measures and the concealment of the potential threat of radiation .
but the soviet authorities maintained tight control of information in and around chernobyl , only releasing sketchy details about the cause and extent of the accident . within less than two days , the wind changed and the radioactive cloud dropped poisoned rain on bavaria .
news coverage in west germany turned to the danger of contamination for the german public .
people in bavaria were told to stay indoors as much as possible .
the government issued warnings for german citizens to refrain from eating salads and forest mushrooms and drinking milk . the young political party , the greens , quickly staged protest rallies , carrying banners bearing the slogan " chernobyl is everywhere . "
in television , politicians debated about the future of nuclear energy in west germany .
nuclear power was no longer considered " safe energy . " " cher n obyl n o da n ger for the gdr " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster gave new wind to germany 's antinuclear movement in east germany , the state-controlled media remained loyal to its soviet partners .
the news broadcast aktuelle kamera issued the initial news statement about the meltdown simultaneously to the west german media .
but it was called an " incident , " not a complete meltdown .
in the days that followed , the focus was on downplaying chernobyl - both in its extremity and in the potential danger for east german citizens .
on the evening of may 1 , a panel of nuclear scientists spoke on east german television . " the east german experts tried to reassure people , " said hardy graupner , a reporter for dw-radio 's english service who worked for radio berlin international in east berlin in 1986 .
" but the information was contradictory .
they said it was a russian problem , that east germany was n't affected by contamination and that our nuclear power plants in greifswald were of a younger generation , and therefore completely safe . " if anything , graupner said , it gave east germans the chance to look down on their big brother , the soviet union . " the chernobyl reactor that exploded was old , " he said .
" experts said that the soviets should have modernized it .
the consensus was that east german technology was more sophisticated .
they said that a nuclear meltdown could never happen in the gdr . " clueless u n til 1990 east german newspapers also downplayed the explosion . " experts say : no danger from chernobyl in east germany , " read the headlines in saxony 's newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , the next day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the mushrooms in turingia safer than in bavaria ?
" it was a two-column article on page six , " thomas schade , an editor at the paper , told dw-world.de.
" that was typical for the gdr - the story did n't make the front page because that was full of coverage of the government 's official may day parades . " saxony was one of the few regions in east germany with little access to western media . " we were dependent on expert opinions , " schade said .
" there were n't any official warnings about not eating fresh vegetables or drinking milk , and so in saxony , we were n't very concerned .
it was n't until after the reunification in 1990 that we found out the real extent of the catastrophe .

" unfortunately , we come up against methods of unfair competition on the world market , " putin said , reiterating earlier comments by russian energy officials who had threatened to intensify business with asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and russian companies are currently building a gas pipeline " despite the high demand for energy resources , we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext , " putin said .
" we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process . " tensions between russia and the european union over energy policy have been on the rise this year after gas supplies to europe were disrupted in january when russia briefly cut supplies over a pricing dispute to ukraine , where pipelines that serve europe are located . since then russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , which provides around one-fourth of the gas supply to europe , has warned that it expects to compete in european energy markets on the same terms as other companies .
gazprom has however declined to open its own monopoly to foreign competition . good chemistry ?

" we talked about molecules , " she told putin afterwards . " i hope that our chemistry will also generate a good atmosphere , " a smiling putin responded . but merkel , a trained physicist whose husband is a chemist , was not to be won over so easily . " it 's a little more complicated than complex molecules , " she rejoined , cautiously . after their first round of talks , putin described the meeting as " intensive " while merkel talked about a " broad strategic cooperation . "
they did not reveal details of the talks . discussi n g ira n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is not giving up his nuclear goals officials from both countries said that diplomatic efforts to check iran 's nuclear program would also be addressed by the two leaders on thursday . germany is one of three eu countries - with britain and france - that back the united states in calls for quick and strong action by the un security council aimed at compelling iran to halt its uranium enrichment activities . however russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear reactor , has said it will oppose efforts to impose international sanctions on tehran until it has seen concrete proof that iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de project fuels german fears of energy dependency on russia as german and russian leaders meet on wednesday , energy giants from both countries will close a deal on developing a russian gas field .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later .

" unfortunately , we come up against methods of unfair competition on the world market , " putin said , reiterating earlier comments by russian energy officials who had threatened to intensify business with asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and russian companies are currently building a gas pipeline " despite the high demand for energy resources , we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext , " putin said .
" we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process . " tensions between russia and the european union over energy policy have been on the rise this year after gas supplies to europe were disrupted in january when russia briefly cut supplies over a pricing dispute to ukraine , where pipelines that serve europe are located . since then russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , which provides around one-fourth of the gas supply to europe , has warned that it expects to compete in european energy markets on the same terms as other companies .
gazprom has however declined to open its own monopoly to foreign competition . good chemistry ?

" we talked about molecules , " she told putin afterwards . " i hope that our chemistry will also generate a good atmosphere , " a smiling putin responded . but merkel , a trained physicist whose husband is a chemist , was not to be won over so easily . " it 's a little more complicated than complex molecules , " she rejoined , cautiously . after their first round of talks , putin described the meeting as " intensive " while merkel talked about a " broad strategic cooperation .

they did not reveal details of the talks . discussi n g ira n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is not giving up his nuclear goals officials from both countries said that diplomatic efforts to check iran 's nuclear program would also be addressed by the two leaders on thursday . germany is one of three eu countries - with britain and france - that back the united states in calls for quick and strong action by the un security council aimed at compelling iran to halt its uranium enrichment activities . however russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear reactor , has said it will oppose efforts to impose international sanctions on tehran until it has seen concrete proof that iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de project fuels german fears of energy dependency on russia as german and russian leaders meet on wednesday , energy giants from both countries will close a deal on developing a russian gas field .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .
but she also added that europeans had to look beyond fossil fuels to meet their future energy needs . " we have to get away from oil and gas and push renewable energies , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom threat rekindles eu concerns russian energy giant gazprom 's threats to reduce supplies to the eu has triggered debate about building non-russian pipelines within the bloc to transport gas from other sources .

" tensions between russia and the european union over energy policy have been on the rise this year after gas supplies to europe were disrupted in january when russia briefly cut supplies over a pricing dispute to ukraine , where pipelines that serve europe are located . since then russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , which provides around one-fourth of the gas supply to europe , has warned that it expects to compete in european energy markets on the same terms as other companies .

" we talked about molecules , " she told putin afterwards . " i hope that our chemistry will also generate a good atmosphere , " a smiling putin responded . but merkel , a trained physicist whose husband is a chemist , was not to be won over so easily . " it 's a little more complicated than complex molecules , " she rejoined , cautiously . after their first round of talks , putin described the meeting as " intensive " while merkel talked about a " broad strategic cooperation .

" we think that after sept.11 , extraordinary renditions were not rare , but a practice that was very well known and wide-spread geographically , " said fava , an italian socialist . european parliamentarians decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations in january in parallel to a separate probe by the strasbourg-based council of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us plane in romania washington has come under intense fire in the last few months after reports about hundreds of cia flights , suspected of carrying undeclared prisoners across european airspace , since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks . because they do not have the authority to require individuals to appear before the committee , the eu lawmakers are relying on voluntary hearings and publicly available information . fava said that such voluntary hearings had confirmed that the cia was " clearly responsible for the abduction and the detention of terrorists on the member states ' territory .

" he also criticized swedish authorities for " turning egyptians mohammed al zary and ahmed agiza over to cia agents in order to repatriate them to egypt knowing very well about the risks of torture .

the un mission in the world body 's largest and most costly , but is still thinly stretched , according to un secretary-general kofi annan , who requested the eu 's assistance . the resolution authorized the force to support un troops seeking to stabilize a situation , protect civilians " under imminent threat of physical violence , " help protect the kinshasa airport , ensure the safety and freedom of movement of its own troops , and extract individuals in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the eu force will be based in kinshasa germany , france provide most support germany will contribute about 500 of the 1,250-strong force with another 500 from france while a group of 10 nations complete the force .
eu leaders plan to send 400 to 450 troops to the drc and to keep a further 800 rapidly-deployable troops on standby outside the country , which is struggling to recover from a war that embroiled most of its neighbors and claimed some 4 million lives . the un resolution also called on the drc government to do its utmost " to ensure that the presidential and parliamentary elections are held in accordance with the timetable of the independent electoral commission . " last month , the eu approved the troop deployment , with officials saying the force would have three key tasks : providing security for international observers , securing kinshasa airport , and , if required , " stabilizing potentially critical situations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers will run the eu 's kinshasa headquarters german troops to be based in kinshasa though the mission could involve forces being deployed virtually anywhere in the country , apart from in the east where un forces have a strong base , the german minister of defense franz josef jung told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung that german troops would remain based in kinshasa . " the main aspect of the european mission is based on deterrence , " he told the paper on wednesday , adding that he did not expect german troops to be moved outside the congolese capital . it is hoped that the elections will mark the end of a volatile political transition in the country that began in 2003 after years of civil war . thirty-two candidates , including current drc president joseph kabila , have been provisionally registered to run in the election , the date for which has been repeatedly postponed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2006 opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praskoviya nezhyvova holds a portrait of her son who died in the chernobyl nuclear explosion the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism . chernobyl was a catalyst which unleashed forces of historical dimensions .
those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .

" we think that after sept.11 , extraordinary renditions were not rare , but a practice that was very well known and wide-spread geographically , " said fava , an italian socialist . european parliamentarians decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations in january in parallel to a separate probe by the strasbourg-based council of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us plane in romania washington has come under intense fire in the last few months after reports about hundreds of cia flights , suspected of carrying undeclared prisoners across european airspace , since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks . because they do not have the authority to require individuals to appear before the committee , the eu lawmakers are relying on voluntary hearings and publicly available information . fava said that such voluntary hearings had confirmed that the cia was " clearly responsible for the abduction and the detention of terrorists on the member states ' territory . " italy , swede n , bos n ia i n volved ? in a draft report to be submitted to other eu lawmakers in june , fava singled out eu member states italy and sweden as well as bosnia , which harbors ambitions to join the 25-nation bloc one day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio fava fava said that it was " improbable that the abduction of egyptian cleric abu omar on feb.17 , 2003 in milan by cia agents was organized and carried out without the previous knowledge of italian authorities and security service . " he also criticized swedish authorities for " turning egyptians mohammed al zary and ahmed agiza over to cia agents in order to repatriate them to egypt knowing very well about the risks of torture . " fava also slammed bosnian authorities for ignoring warnings of the bosnian human rights chamber in 2002 and transferring six algerian residents to the united states , which has since sent them to the controversial detention center in guantanamo , cuba . exami n i n g al-masri case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid al-masri testifying in strasbourg in march members of the parliament 's committee investigating the cia flights are to head to macedonia on thursday and friday to look into the case of khaled al-masri , a german of lebanese origin , who accuses the cia of having kidnapped him at the end of 2003 and interrogated him in afghanistan . they are also to visit the united states on a may 8-12 trip , although it is uncertain who will agree to see them there . eu foreign policy chief javier solana has agreed to meet with the lawmakers on may 2 and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has also agreed to an interview . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany accused of accepting information gained under torture a former british ambassador to uzbekistan turned up the heat on germany thursday when he told a european parliament committee that germany had received information " most certainly obtained under torture " in uzbekistan .

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .
at 9 p.m. that evening , moscow officially announced to the world that an " accident " had taken place at the chernobyl power station . too little , too late news spread quickly , but information was thin .
the first reports in west german media came as a short news brief in the evening news . " our correspondent in moscow reported about the accident , but there was no information about any potential danger , " jan hofer , a newscaster that evening for tagestheme n , the nightly news report of german public broadcaster ard , told fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g .
" we had no idea what a gau was - a nuclear worst case scenario - there was little information to go on and no images .
the fear came later , as the bad news was made public . " no milk , n o mushrooms , n o playi n g outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings against fresh milk held in the weeks following the accident west german politicians went into an uproar against the soviet union , condemning its lax safety measures and the concealment of the potential threat of radiation .
but the soviet authorities maintained tight control of information in and around chernobyl , only releasing sketchy details about the cause and extent of the accident . within less than two days , the wind changed and the radioactive cloud dropped poisoned rain on bavaria .
news coverage in west germany turned to the danger of contamination for the german public .
people in bavaria were told to stay indoors as much as possible .
the government issued warnings for german citizens to refrain from eating salads and forest mushrooms and drinking milk . the young political party , the greens , quickly staged protest rallies , carrying banners bearing the slogan " chernobyl is everywhere . "
in television , politicians debated about the future of nuclear energy in west germany .
nuclear power was no longer considered " safe energy . " " cher n obyl n o da n ger for the gdr " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster gave new wind to germany 's antinuclear movement in east germany , the state-controlled media remained loyal to its soviet partners .
the news broadcast aktuelle kamera issued the initial news statement about the meltdown simultaneously to the west german media .
but it was called an " incident , " not a complete meltdown .
in the days that followed , the focus was on downplaying chernobyl - both in its extremity and in the potential danger for east german citizens .
on the evening of may 1 , a panel of nuclear scientists spoke on east german television . " the east german experts tried to reassure people , " said hardy graupner , a reporter for dw-radio 's english service who worked for radio berlin international in east berlin in 1986 .
" but the information was contradictory .
they said it was a russian problem , that east germany was n't affected by contamination and that our nuclear power plants in greifswald were of a younger generation , and therefore completely safe . " if anything , graupner said , it gave east germans the chance to look down on their big brother , the soviet union . " the chernobyl reactor that exploded was old , " he said .
" experts said that the soviets should have modernized it .
the consensus was that east german technology was more sophisticated .
they said that a nuclear meltdown could never happen in the gdr . " clueless u n til 1990 east german newspapers also downplayed the explosion . " experts say : no danger from chernobyl in east germany , " read the headlines in saxony 's newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , the next day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the mushrooms in turingia safer than in bavaria ?
" it was a two-column article on page six , " thomas schade , an editor at the paper , told dw-world.de.
" that was typical for the gdr - the story did n't make the front page because that was full of coverage of the government 's official may day parades . " saxony was one of the few regions in east germany with little access to western media . " we were dependent on expert opinions , " schade said .
" there were n't any official warnings about not eating fresh vegetables or drinking milk , and so in saxony , we were n't very concerned .
it was n't until after the reunification in 1990 that we found out the real extent of the catastrophe .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .

making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .

" unfortunately , we come up against methods of unfair competition on the world market , " putin said , reiterating earlier comments by russian energy officials who had threatened to intensify business with asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and russian companies are currently building a gas pipeline " despite the high demand for energy resources , we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext , " putin said .
" we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process . " tensions between russia and the european union over energy policy have been on the rise this year after gas supplies to europe were disrupted in january when russia briefly cut supplies over a pricing dispute to ukraine , where pipelines that serve europe are located . since then russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , which provides around one-fourth of the gas supply to europe , has warned that it expects to compete in european energy markets on the same terms as other companies .
gazprom has however declined to open its own monopoly to foreign competition . good chemistry ? " we will touch on all the issues of our cooperation , " putin said as he met merkel for talks at a science library of tomsk university , shortly after the german leader arrived in the central siberian industrial city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkels predecessor gerhard schröder and putin were certainly closer putin , a fluent german speaker who worked as a kgb officer in east germany , and merkel , who grew up in east germany and also speaks russian , exchanged pleasantries in front of journalists as they prepared to sit down for their initial meeting . merkel was met at the university by the dean of the science college , a specialist in quantum chemistry . " we talked about molecules , " she told putin afterwards . " i hope that our chemistry will also generate a good atmosphere , " a smiling putin responded . but merkel , a trained physicist whose husband is a chemist , was not to be won over so easily . " it 's a little more complicated than complex molecules , " she rejoined , cautiously . after their first round of talks , putin described the meeting as " intensive " while merkel talked about a " broad strategic cooperation . "
they did not reveal details of the talks . discussi n g ira n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is not giving up his nuclear goals officials from both countries said that diplomatic efforts to check iran 's nuclear program would also be addressed by the two leaders on thursday . germany is one of three eu countries - with britain and france - that back the united states in calls for quick and strong action by the un security council aimed at compelling iran to halt its uranium enrichment activities . however russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear reactor , has said it will oppose efforts to impose international sanctions on tehran until it has seen concrete proof that iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de project fuels german fears of energy dependency on russia as german and russian leaders meet on wednesday , energy giants from both countries will close a deal on developing a russian gas field .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .
-lrb- april 25 , 2006 -rrb- " every type of reactor poses a threat " the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de.

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .
at 9 p.m. that evening , moscow officially announced to the world that an " accident " had taken place at the chernobyl power station . too little , too late news spread quickly , but information was thin .
the first reports in west german media came as a short news brief in the evening news . " our correspondent in moscow reported about the accident , but there was no information about any potential danger , " jan hofer , a newscaster that evening for tagestheme n , the nightly news report of german public broadcaster ard , told fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g .
" we had no idea what a gau was - a nuclear worst case scenario - there was little information to go on and no images .
the fear came later , as the bad news was made public . " no milk , n o mushrooms , n o playi n g outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings against fresh milk held in the weeks following the accident west german politicians went into an uproar against the soviet union , condemning its lax safety measures and the concealment of the potential threat of radiation .
but the soviet authorities maintained tight control of information in and around chernobyl , only releasing sketchy details about the cause and extent of the accident . within less than two days , the wind changed and the radioactive cloud dropped poisoned rain on bavaria .
news coverage in west germany turned to the danger of contamination for the german public .
people in bavaria were told to stay indoors as much as possible .
the government issued warnings for german citizens to refrain from eating salads and forest mushrooms and drinking milk . the young political party , the greens , quickly staged protest rallies , carrying banners bearing the slogan " chernobyl is everywhere . "
in television , politicians debated about the future of nuclear energy in west germany .
nuclear power was no longer considered " safe energy . " " cher n obyl n o da n ger for the gdr " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster gave new wind to germany 's antinuclear movement in east germany , the state-controlled media remained loyal to its soviet partners .
the news broadcast aktuelle kamera issued the initial news statement about the meltdown simultaneously to the west german media .
but it was called an " incident , " not a complete meltdown .
in the days that followed , the focus was on downplaying chernobyl - both in its extremity and in the potential danger for east german citizens .
on the evening of may 1 , a panel of nuclear scientists spoke on east german television . " the east german experts tried to reassure people , " said hardy graupner , a reporter for dw-radio 's english service who worked for radio berlin international in east berlin in 1986 .
" but the information was contradictory .
they said it was a russian problem , that east germany was n't affected by contamination and that our nuclear power plants in greifswald were of a younger generation , and therefore completely safe . " if anything , graupner said , it gave east germans the chance to look down on their big brother , the soviet union . " the chernobyl reactor that exploded was old , " he said .
" experts said that the soviets should have modernized it .
the consensus was that east german technology was more sophisticated .
they said that a nuclear meltdown could never happen in the gdr . " clueless u n til 1990 east german newspapers also downplayed the explosion . " experts say : no danger from chernobyl in east germany , " read the headlines in saxony 's newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , the next day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the mushrooms in turingia safer than in bavaria ?
" it was a two-column article on page six , " thomas schade , an editor at the paper , told dw-world.de.
" that was typical for the gdr - the story did n't make the front page because that was full of coverage of the government 's official may day parades . " saxony was one of the few regions in east germany with little access to western media . " we were dependent on expert opinions , " schade said .
" there were n't any official warnings about not eating fresh vegetables or drinking milk , and so in saxony , we were n't very concerned .
it was n't until after the reunification in 1990 that we found out the real extent of the catastrophe .

those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .

a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .
frankfurt was chosen as the location on account of its accessibility , its proximity to the sea and - perhaps more surprisingly - the fact it was then surrounded by vineyards .

while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .
but she also added that europeans had to look beyond fossil fuels to meet their future energy needs .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .
during last year 's winter semester , students from 79 nations were enrolled at the university - a considerably higher percentage than in other german universities .

a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .
frankfurt was chosen as the location on account of its accessibility , its proximity to the sea and - perhaps more surprisingly - the fact it was then surrounded by vineyards .
the university was organized into four faculties , law , theology , philosophy , and medicine , and enjoyed an excellent reputation in brandenburg and the surrounding regions .

as the various churches vied for prominence over subsequent centuries , the viadrina remained characterized by religious tolerance , withstanding the effects of the reformation in the 1530s and becoming , by the early 17th century , a strongly calvinist university even though the theology faculty retained a lutheran department .
in its heyday , it was a stronghold of humanism and enlightened values , spawning generations of high-profile graduates who went on to become diplomats , lawyers and high-ranking members of the military .

the old university building in frankfurt was destroyed in world war ii and finally cleared in the 1960s .
the arch of the main entrance has been preserved as a monument .
international in 1991 , the university was re-established as viadrina european university , comprising three faculties : economics and business studies ; law ; and cultural studies .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .

" the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .
but she also added that europeans had to look beyond fossil fuels to meet their future energy needs . " we have to get away from oil and gas and push renewable energies , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom threat rekindles eu concerns russian energy giant gazprom 's threats to reduce supplies to the eu has triggered debate about building non-russian pipelines within the bloc to transport gas from other sources .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .

" russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs .

but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .
during last year 's winter semester , students from 79 nations were enrolled at the university - a considerably higher percentage than in other german universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gesine schwan - she could have been president for the last seven years , its president has been gesine schwan , a charismatic political scientist who has long been active in german politics and was chosen by the spd as its nominee for the presidential elections in 2004 , only to be beaten by horst köhler . the university 's best-known graduates include the scholars alexander and wilhelm von humboldt , as well as the philosopher ulrich von hutten , the theologian and political leader thomas müntzer and the writer heinrich von kleist .
a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .
frankfurt was chosen as the location on account of its accessibility , its proximity to the sea and - perhaps more surprisingly - the fact it was then surrounded by vineyards .
the university was organized into four faculties , law , theology , philosophy , and medicine , and enjoyed an excellent reputation in brandenburg and the surrounding regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalist and scientist alexander von humboldt it soon built up a reputation as a bastion of tolerance , gaining independence from local politics and exempting its students from both tax contributions and military service .
as the various churches vied for prominence over subsequent centuries , the viadrina remained characterized by religious tolerance , withstanding the effects of the reformation in the 1530s and becoming , by the early 17th century , a strongly calvinist university even though the theology faculty retained a lutheran department .
in its heyday , it was a stronghold of humanism and enlightened values , spawning generations of high-profile graduates who went on to become diplomats , lawyers and high-ranking members of the military .
turning point despite being plagued by financial problems that persist to this day , the viadrina university continued to flourish , and by the 19th century , it was home to some 55,000 students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university but in 1811 , the founding of the university of berlin , now known as the humboldt university , led to the closure of the frankfurt premises .
the viadrina moved to breslau , where it merged with the existing university , the leopoldina , in order to boost its competitiveness .
the old university building in frankfurt was destroyed in world war ii and finally cleared in the 1960s .
the arch of the main entrance has been preserved as a monument .
international in 1991 , the university was re-established as viadrina european university , comprising three faculties : economics and business studies ; law ; and cultural studies .
a prime focus of the educational program was to attract students from throughout europe in order to create a multi-national student body .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 30 percent of the viadrina 's students come from poland poised between frankfurt and slubice , the university 's location has always been its main strength .
it now maintains close cooperation with the adam mickiewicz university in poznan , poland , with the two universities jointly operating the collegium polonicum , located just opposite the viadrina on the polish side of the oder river .
" our geographical proximity to poland is a trump card we ca n't afford to ignore , " said gesine schwan in a recent interview with die welt .
" in future we must continue to attract international students as well as providing courses with an international slant for our german students .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2006 opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praskoviya nezhyvova holds a portrait of her son who died in the chernobyl nuclear explosion the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism . chernobyl was a catalyst which unleashed forces of historical dimensions .
those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .
but she also added that europeans had to look beyond fossil fuels to meet their future energy needs . " we have to get away from oil and gas and push renewable energies , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom threat rekindles eu concerns russian energy giant gazprom 's threats to reduce supplies to the eu has triggered debate about building non-russian pipelines within the bloc to transport gas from other sources .

those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .
-lrb- april 18 , 2006 -rrb- remembering chernobyl twenty years ago , the world was confronted with the dangers of atomic energy after a meltdown at the chernobyl nuclear power plant .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .

experts say the project will only increase germany 's energy dependency on russia . when german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and their respective cabinets meet for talks in the western siberian town of tomsk on wednesday , the current nuclear crisis with iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the pipeline already began last december but the two leaders are also expected to attend the signing of an agreement between germany 's basf and e.on companies and russia 's state-owned gazprom to develop the yuzhno-russkoje gas field with reserves sufficient to meet germany 's demand for seven years . the gas will reach germany via a new baltic sea pipeline that the three companies are building .
while russian gas currently accounts for about 35 percent of german gas imports , the amount will increase by 5 percent when the pipeline is completed . flexing muscles some described the deal as a further step to secure germany 's gas supply in the long term , but energy experts worry that it will only increase dependency on russia 's resources . such concerns were fuelled last week when gazprom officials hinted that they could sell their gas to asia and north america if european countries refused to let the company enter their markets .
russia 's oil pipeline monopolist , transneft , followed suit shortly after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and putin during a meeting in january while gazprom officials have since tried to placate the situation by saying that they did not mean to threaten or blackmail the europeans , a german government spokesman described the original statements as " not helpful " and energy experts called on merkel to bring up the issue in tomsk . " strong criticism is called for , " said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research , adding that merkel 's government had a more realistic assessment of the dangers of relying largely on russian gas than her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who now chairs the supervisory board of the baltic sea pipeline project . " the government has to be interested in securing germany 's energy supply , " she said .
" if the russians would rather sell to the chinese , we need to know to look for alternative suppliers . " a long-term interdependence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a booming economy , china wo n't match europe 's gas demands but kemfert also agreed with others that russia was highly unlikely to shut down its pipelines to europe in the near future . " russia and europe are dependent on each other , " said friedemann müller , an energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs .
while it would take decades for gazprom to build pipelines to asia , europe 's demand for gas would still outstrip chinese and indian orders by far , he added . " that 's why russians need the eu as a market in the long term , " müller said .
" but that does n't keep them from flexing their muscles " to prevent europeans from looking for alternative energy sources and keep their own pipelines in business . the result is a vicious circle as europe , in return , needs to find new suppliers to meet energy needs . " we can not rely on one supplier , " müller said , adding that germany had neglected alternatives , such as ports for ships carrying liquefied gas , for too long . short-term business interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and turkmen president saparmurat niyazov a new pipeline to connect the massive gas fields of turkmenistan and the entire south caspian region with europe was another crucial step to decrease dependency on russia , müller said .
but such an endeavor would only help in the long run : a few years ago , russia bought up turkmenistan 's gas production up to the year 2020 . eu officials wanted to secure turkmenistan 's gas supplies in the 1990s , but the business interests of german energy companies played a role in preventing this , müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are renewable energy sources such as solar power the real alternative ?
" companies here were not interested in diversification , because they were making good business with gazprom , " he said . kemfert agreed with müller that liquefied gas and new pipelines to non-russian gas fields should be pursued .
but she also added that europeans had to look beyond fossil fuels to meet their future energy needs . " we have to get away from oil and gas and push renewable energies , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom threat rekindles eu concerns russian energy giant gazprom 's threats to reduce supplies to the eu has triggered debate about building non-russian pipelines within the bloc to transport gas from other sources .

those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .
during last year 's winter semester , students from 79 nations were enrolled at the university - a considerably higher percentage than in other german universities .

a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .
frankfurt was chosen as the location on account of its accessibility , its proximity to the sea and - perhaps more surprisingly - the fact it was then surrounded by vineyards .
the university was organized into four faculties , law , theology , philosophy , and medicine , and enjoyed an excellent reputation in brandenburg and the surrounding regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naturalist and scientist alexander von humboldt it soon built up a reputation as a bastion of tolerance , gaining independence from local politics and exempting its students from both tax contributions and military service .
as the various churches vied for prominence over subsequent centuries , the viadrina remained characterized by religious tolerance , withstanding the effects of the reformation in the 1530s and becoming , by the early 17th century , a strongly calvinist university even though the theology faculty retained a lutheran department .
in its heyday , it was a stronghold of humanism and enlightened values , spawning generations of high-profile graduates who went on to become diplomats , lawyers and high-ranking members of the military .
turning point despite being plagued by financial problems that persist to this day , the viadrina university continued to flourish , and by the 19th century , it was home to some 55,000 students .

the old university building in frankfurt was destroyed in world war ii and finally cleared in the 1960s .
the arch of the main entrance has been preserved as a monument .
international in 1991 , the university was re-established as viadrina european university , comprising three faculties : economics and business studies ; law ; and cultural studies .
a prime focus of the educational program was to attract students from throughout europe in order to create a multi-national student body .

it now maintains close cooperation with the adam mickiewicz university in poznan , poland , with the two universities jointly operating the collegium polonicum , located just opposite the viadrina on the polish side of the oder river .
" our geographical proximity to poland is a trump card we ca n't afford to ignore , " said gesine schwan in a recent interview with die welt .

those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .

chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .

governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .

the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .

hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .

shut for 180 years , it was revamped as a " european university " 15 years ago and continues to maintain an excellent reputation . one of germany 's smallest state universities , the viadrina has around 4,000 students - 30 percent of whom come from poland - and a teaching staff of 160 .

a chequered history the alma mater viadrina was founded in 1506 by the prince of brandenburg , joachim i , as the state 's foremost university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2006 opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praskoviya nezhyvova holds a portrait of her son who died in the chernobyl nuclear explosion the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism . chernobyl was a catalyst which unleashed forces of historical dimensions .
those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .
-lrb- april 18 , 2006 -rrb- remembering chernobyl twenty years ago , the world was confronted with the dangers of atomic energy after a meltdown at the chernobyl nuclear power plant .

" this is a night of remembrance and tragedy , " said borys ulavin , a 59-year-old who participated in the clean-up of the disaster . painful memories somber-faced , many with tears in their eyes , the human stream made its way toward a monument honoring the 30 people who died in the first year after the accident that became a grim symbol of the hazards of atomic energy . " i knew all of these people , " mykola ryabushkin said , pointing to the portraits hanging on the monument .
the 59-year-old was an operator at the station and was working the night of the explosion that bathed the station in an otherworldly bluish light . " i look at them and i want to ask them for forgiveness , " he said , tears rolling down his cheeks .
" maybe we 're all to blame for letting this accident happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko lays flowers at a memorial to chernobyl victims ukrainian president viktor yushchenko led another 300 people who attended a memorial service at a church in eastern kiev that features memorial plaques of many of those who died fighting the immediate aftermath of the accident . impact felt across the planet the cloud released by the chernobyl explosion settled mostly in ukraine and neighboring belarus to the north , but parts of it drifted across russia and a large swathe of europe , and its effects were felt from scandinavia to greece . the impact was made worse by the fact that the then soviet authorities concealed the extent of what had happened for several days and did not begin to evacuate people from the area until more than a day and half later . " the explosion affected half of the planet , but belarus and ukraine suffered worst of all , " terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , said in a statement on tuesday .
" for these countries , chernobyl is not an historic event , it is a problem of today and of tomorrow , " davis said . at an eerie ceremony in front of the concrete sarcophagus covering the destroyed reactor , with a dozen journalists their only audience , a french theater troupe late tuesday recounted stories of a handful of ordinary people who found their lives torn apart by the disaster . " we are playing for the dead , " said bruno boussagol , the producer and artistic director of the brut de beton troupe . death toll remains disputed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the chernobyl plant , a few days after the accident some five million people are believed to have been affected by the disaster in belarus , russia and ukraine , all of which still have regions where the levels of dangerous cesium-137 and strontium-90 radioisotopes are much higher than accepted norms . two decades on , millions of acres -lrb- hectares -rrb- of agricultural and forest land remain contaminated from the accident and its death toll is hotly debated . agencies of the united nations , backed by the governments of belarus , russia and ukraine , estimate that between 4,000 and 9,000 people could be expected to die overall as a direct consequence of the accident . environmental groups put the figure at 100,000 and higher . the un has estimated that the disaster will end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars . chernobyl plant still raises concerns the chernobyl plant was eventually closed for good in december 2000 but will continue to be a concern for years to come . the concrete sarcophagus that was hastily constructed over its destroyed reactor immediately following the accident is showing signs of wear and more than 20 countries have chipped in nearly a billion dollars for the construction of a 20,000-ton steel case to take its place . construction of the new containment unit is expected to begin later this year and ukraine hopes to complete it by 2010 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

" tensions between russia and the european union over energy policy have been on the rise this year after gas supplies to europe were disrupted in january when russia briefly cut supplies over a pricing dispute to ukraine , where pipelines that serve europe are located . since then russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , which provides around one-fourth of the gas supply to europe , has warned that it expects to compete in european energy markets on the same terms as other companies .

" we talked about molecules , " she told putin afterwards .

they did not reveal details of the talks . discussi n g ira n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is not giving up his nuclear goals officials from both countries said that diplomatic efforts to check iran 's nuclear program would also be addressed by the two leaders on thursday . germany is one of three eu countries - with britain and france - that back the united states in calls for quick and strong action by the un security council aimed at compelling iran to halt its uranium enrichment activities . however russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear reactor , has said it will oppose efforts to impose international sanctions on tehran until it has seen concrete proof that iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de project fuels german fears of energy dependency on russia as german and russian leaders meet on wednesday , energy giants from both countries will close a deal on developing a russian gas field .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

or will he go back to his old flame , nathalie ?
at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .
she helped develop the roles of ansgar , tanja and co . , creating delicate blossoms of romance , and then stamping them into the ground through various intrigues and plot twists . paths to happi n ess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what path will bianca choose in her search for happiness ?
making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner . "
together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela . " there , the conflicts mainly center around wealth - rich versus poor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.04.2006 opinion : chernobyl - an insidious legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praskoviya nezhyvova holds a portrait of her son who died in the chernobyl nuclear explosion the events of april 26 , 1986 , in then-soviet ruled ukraine were catastrophic , but they also set off important political changes ranging from the environmental movement to the collapse of communism . chernobyl was a catalyst which unleashed forces of historical dimensions .
those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .
-lrb- april 18 , 2006 -rrb- remembering chernobyl twenty years ago , the world was confronted with the dangers of atomic energy after a meltdown at the chernobyl nuclear power plant .

those soviet functionaries who used time-honored communist methods to respond to the accident - lying to the population then covering up the aftermath - helped bring that about , even if they did n't intend to .
even the secretary general of the communist party , mikhail gorbachev , only found out gradually what the true magnitude of the disaster was - and it changed his relationship with the communist party apparatus . from then on gorbachev mistrusted the political system that had put him in power .
he tried to reform it , instituted policies of transparency - glasnost - and structural reforms - perestroika .
a few years later the cold war came to an end and the iron curtain fell .
chernobyl played a role in all of it . this worst-case scenario changed the energy policies of many nations .
people recognized the lethal dangers that accompany nuclear energy .
parties that demanded a withdrawal from nuclear energy programs , which they considered uncontrollable , won seats in the european parliament .
" green " politicians took on positions of power in government .
since then , at least in western europe , the development of alternative energy technologies has been strongly supported .
germany has excelled in this area and should be - rightly - proud .
it can also take pride in the dozens of citizens ' initiatives which have supported victims of chernobyl in belarus and ukraine with money and medicine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dilapidated house is seen in the so-called exclusion zone , a highly contaminated area surrounding the chernobyl plant for 20 years now , citizens ' initiatives , parties and governments have tried to overcome problems that are , right now anyway , simply unmanageable .
the radioactive fallout from chernobyl had a contaminating force 400 times greater than that from the nuclear bomb dropped on hiroshima , and large areas around chernobyl will remain contaminated for the foreseeable future . for tens of thousands of people , financial realities keep them tied to the region and living amid the radiation .
governments in minsk and kiev lack the means to effectively address the consequences of the catastrophe . dangerous decay now ukraine 's badly functioning bureaucracy is further complicating the situation .
the hastily built " sarcophagus " that was built over the damaged reactor has deteriorated , becoming fragile and brittle .
visible cracks have formed through which radioactivity escapes into the environment .
it appears to only be a matter of time before the protective cover collapses under its own weight .
the west has provided money for an even larger hull , but progress on its construction has been slow . and now , even 20 years after the accident , its long-term consequences are still unknown .
the number of birth defects in the area around the affected zone has increased substantially .
hundreds of thousands of so-called liquidators - people who directly after the accident risked their lives trying to protect themselves from worse , often with their bare hands - are aging unusually rapidly and many have cancer .
hardly anyone gives a damn about them , often due to money , or better said , the lack thereof . chernobyl has left an insidious legacy .
we ca n't simply leave people in ukraine and belarus to fend for themselves .
this difficult burden , if it can be managed at all , has to be managed together , by both east and west . miodrag soric -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chernobyl " liquidators " still fight oblivion once the heroes of a nation , the first people to enter the chernobyl power plant after block 4 exploded 20 years ago are fighting for medical care after being forgotten since the breakup of the soviet union .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .
at 9 p.m. that evening , moscow officially announced to the world that an " accident " had taken place at the chernobyl power station . too little , too late news spread quickly , but information was thin .
the first reports in west german media came as a short news brief in the evening news . " our correspondent in moscow reported about the accident , but there was no information about any potential danger , " jan hofer , a newscaster that evening for tagestheme n , the nightly news report of german public broadcaster ard , told fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g .
" we had no idea what a gau was - a nuclear worst case scenario - there was little information to go on and no images .
the fear came later , as the bad news was made public . " no milk , n o mushrooms , n o playi n g outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings against fresh milk held in the weeks following the accident west german politicians went into an uproar against the soviet union , condemning its lax safety measures and the concealment of the potential threat of radiation .
but the soviet authorities maintained tight control of information in and around chernobyl , only releasing sketchy details about the cause and extent of the accident . within less than two days , the wind changed and the radioactive cloud dropped poisoned rain on bavaria .
news coverage in west germany turned to the danger of contamination for the german public .
people in bavaria were told to stay indoors as much as possible .
the government issued warnings for german citizens to refrain from eating salads and forest mushrooms and drinking milk . the young political party , the greens , quickly staged protest rallies , carrying banners bearing the slogan " chernobyl is everywhere . "
in television , politicians debated about the future of nuclear energy in west germany .
nuclear power was no longer considered " safe energy . " " cher n obyl n o da n ger for the gdr " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster gave new wind to germany 's antinuclear movement in east germany , the state-controlled media remained loyal to its soviet partners .
the news broadcast aktuelle kamera issued the initial news statement about the meltdown simultaneously to the west german media .
but it was called an " incident , " not a complete meltdown .
in the days that followed , the focus was on downplaying chernobyl - both in its extremity and in the potential danger for east german citizens .
on the evening of may 1 , a panel of nuclear scientists spoke on east german television . " the east german experts tried to reassure people , " said hardy graupner , a reporter for dw-radio 's english service who worked for radio berlin international in east berlin in 1986 .
" but the information was contradictory .
they said it was a russian problem , that east germany was n't affected by contamination and that our nuclear power plants in greifswald were of a younger generation , and therefore completely safe . " if anything , graupner said , it gave east germans the chance to look down on their big brother , the soviet union . " the chernobyl reactor that exploded was old , " he said .
" experts said that the soviets should have modernized it .
the consensus was that east german technology was more sophisticated .
they said that a nuclear meltdown could never happen in the gdr . " clueless u n til 1990 east german newspapers also downplayed the explosion . " experts say : no danger from chernobyl in east germany , " read the headlines in saxony 's newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , the next day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the mushrooms in turingia safer than in bavaria ?
" it was a two-column article on page six , " thomas schade , an editor at the paper , told dw-world.de.
" that was typical for the gdr - the story did n't make the front page because that was full of coverage of the government 's official may day parades . " saxony was one of the few regions in east germany with little access to western media . " we were dependent on expert opinions , " schade said .
" there were n't any official warnings about not eating fresh vegetables or drinking milk , and so in saxony , we were n't very concerned .
it was n't until after the reunification in 1990 that we found out the real extent of the catastrophe .

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .

the un mission in the world body 's largest and most costly , but is still thinly stretched , according to un secretary-general kofi annan , who requested the eu 's assistance . the resolution authorized the force to support un troops seeking to stabilize a situation , protect civilians " under imminent threat of physical violence , " help protect the kinshasa airport , ensure the safety and freedom of movement of its own troops , and extract individuals in danger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the eu force will be based in kinshasa germany , france provide most support germany will contribute about 500 of the 1,250-strong force with another 500 from france while a group of 10 nations complete the force .
eu leaders plan to send 400 to 450 troops to the drc and to keep a further 800 rapidly-deployable troops on standby outside the country , which is struggling to recover from a war that embroiled most of its neighbors and claimed some 4 million lives . the un resolution also called on the drc government to do its utmost " to ensure that the presidential and parliamentary elections are held in accordance with the timetable of the independent electoral commission . " last month , the eu approved the troop deployment , with officials saying the force would have three key tasks : providing security for international observers , securing kinshasa airport , and , if required , " stabilizing potentially critical situations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french soldiers will run the eu 's kinshasa headquarters german troops to be based in kinshasa though the mission could involve forces being deployed virtually anywhere in the country , apart from in the east where un forces have a strong base , the german minister of defense franz josef jung told the frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung that german troops would remain based in kinshasa . " the main aspect of the european mission is based on deterrence , " he told the paper on wednesday , adding that he did not expect german troops to be moved outside the congolese capital . it is hoped that the elections will mark the end of a volatile political transition in the country that began in 2003 after years of civil war . thirty-two candidates , including current drc president joseph kabila , have been provisionally registered to run in the election , the date for which has been repeatedly postponed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .

among them was ravindra gujullah , an indian-born general practitioner who runs his own clinic in a village outside berlin . " everything you do with a patient means a particular number of points , " he said .
" for an electrocardiogram i may have 250 points , for a stress electrocardiogram about 500 points .
for every point , i get a certain sum of money , but this amount changes every month .
it is a very peculiar thing because although i have more and more work to do , the money is actually decreasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors demonstrating against bureaucracy in the health system gujjulah says he spends at least two hours every day doing paperwork required by german authorities - most of which , he believes , will end up in a wastepaper basket . estimates say that rampant bureaucracy today wastes a staggering 4 to 6 percent of the turnover of small and medium-sized enterprises in germany . freedom for all chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has therefore set up an independent panel of experts charged with assessing the costs incurred by germany 's bureaucratic jungle , and making proposals on how to thin it out .
the panel 's motto : " more freedom for all . " " the first principle is more freedom for our companies to produce more and to employ more people , " said hildegard müller , who will oversee the panel 's work .
" the second aim is to make it easier for the general public to live here and have more freedom of personal activity . " the panel has adopted an approach known as the " standard costs model " which has already been successfully applied in the netherlands .
during phase two , the experts will check existing and future laws to see how they can be changed to save costs . a catalog of 16 red tape-saving measures was already enacted on tuesday .
among other things , it frees more than 150,000 small firms of previous strict bookkeeping regulations and statistical duties . overcoming past failures müller is convinced that , unlike previous attempts to slash bureaucracy , this time , the government will succeed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small businesses would profit from having to do less paperwork " i think we have a great chance because this time both the major parties - the christian democrats and the social democrats - stand behind this initiative , " she said .
" it is an initiative by the chancellery and not just by a ministry .
the whole cabinet today agreed that it ’ s a main issue for this legislature . " müller added , however , that she expects resistance from a variety of lobby groups .
but the chancellor is determined to complete this task , she added , and has already promised to take this initiative to the eu level , where she believes red tape is even more of a problem than it is in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

while media coverage in the west was quick to depict the " worst case scenario , " the media in east germany downplayed the " incident . " the first reports that hinted at a meltdown from the soviet nuclear power plant did not come from moscow - they came from sweden .
on april 28 , 1986 , technicians at the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant detected a radioactive cloud passing from east to west .
they soon confirmed that the leak was not coming from their own reactors , but coming with air currents from the black sea .
at 9 p.m. that evening , moscow officially announced to the world that an " accident " had taken place at the chernobyl power station . too little , too late news spread quickly , but information was thin .
the first reports in west german media came as a short news brief in the evening news . " our correspondent in moscow reported about the accident , but there was no information about any potential danger , " jan hofer , a newscaster that evening for tagestheme n , the nightly news report of german public broadcaster ard , told fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g .
" we had no idea what a gau was - a nuclear worst case scenario - there was little information to go on and no images .
the fear came later , as the bad news was made public . " no milk , n o mushrooms , n o playi n g outside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings against fresh milk held in the weeks following the accident west german politicians went into an uproar against the soviet union , condemning its lax safety measures and the concealment of the potential threat of radiation .
but the soviet authorities maintained tight control of information in and around chernobyl , only releasing sketchy details about the cause and extent of the accident . within less than two days , the wind changed and the radioactive cloud dropped poisoned rain on bavaria .
news coverage in west germany turned to the danger of contamination for the german public .
people in bavaria were told to stay indoors as much as possible .
the government issued warnings for german citizens to refrain from eating salads and forest mushrooms and drinking milk . the young political party , the greens , quickly staged protest rallies , carrying banners bearing the slogan " chernobyl is everywhere . "
in television , politicians debated about the future of nuclear energy in west germany .
nuclear power was no longer considered " safe energy . " " cher n obyl n o da n ger for the gdr " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster gave new wind to germany 's antinuclear movement in east germany , the state-controlled media remained loyal to its soviet partners .
the news broadcast aktuelle kamera issued the initial news statement about the meltdown simultaneously to the west german media .
but it was called an " incident , " not a complete meltdown .
in the days that followed , the focus was on downplaying chernobyl - both in its extremity and in the potential danger for east german citizens .
on the evening of may 1 , a panel of nuclear scientists spoke on east german television . " the east german experts tried to reassure people , " said hardy graupner , a reporter for dw-radio 's english service who worked for radio berlin international in east berlin in 1986 .
" but the information was contradictory .
they said it was a russian problem , that east germany was n't affected by contamination and that our nuclear power plants in greifswald were of a younger generation , and therefore completely safe . " if anything , graupner said , it gave east germans the chance to look down on their big brother , the soviet union . " the chernobyl reactor that exploded was old , " he said .
" experts said that the soviets should have modernized it .
the consensus was that east german technology was more sophisticated .
they said that a nuclear meltdown could never happen in the gdr . " clueless u n til 1990 east german newspapers also downplayed the explosion . " experts say : no danger from chernobyl in east germany , " read the headlines in saxony 's newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , the next day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were the mushrooms in turingia safer than in bavaria ?
" it was a two-column article on page six , " thomas schade , an editor at the paper , told dw-world.de.
" that was typical for the gdr - the story did n't make the front page because that was full of coverage of the government 's official may day parades . " saxony was one of the few regions in east germany with little access to western media . " we were dependent on expert opinions , " schade said .
" there were n't any official warnings about not eating fresh vegetables or drinking milk , and so in saxony , we were n't very concerned .
it was n't until after the reunification in 1990 that we found out the real extent of the catastrophe .

or will he go back to his old flame , nathalie ?
at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .
she helped develop the roles of ansgar , tanja and co . , creating delicate blossoms of romance , and then stamping them into the ground through various intrigues and plot twists . paths to happi n ess bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what path will bianca choose in her search for happiness ?
making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .
to learn " series theory , " she took courses at the grundy ufa school in potsdam-babelsberg .
the australian production company set up the course in july of last year when demand for tv writers skyrocketed due to the success of telenovelas such as " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . this week , tjia completed her final exams at the school , putting her in the first class to graduate and earn the job title " storyliner .

after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela .

one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .

" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .
" it 's a lot more demanding and complex than watching the shows . " tjia 's already secured herself a contract as a junior storyliner on " verbotene liebe . "

at the screenwriting school in potsdam 's famous babelsberg studios , german writers are learning about what tv viewers love to see . alexandra tjia already knows what ansgar is going to do - but she 's not allowed to talk about what will happen in the next episode of the long-running german soap opera " verbotene liebe " -lrb- forbidden love -rrb- . tjia was one of the writers working on the show 's script ; for three months , she was part of the production team at public broadcaster ard .

making up storylines for " verbotene liebe " was part of tjia 's training to become an author for industrially produced television series , soaps or " telenovelas , " as prime-time soaps are called in germany .

together with 15 others , tjia now has the skill to turn television viewers into soap opera junkies . " you have to write the characters in a way that there 'll always be a new conflict just around the corner - hatred , jealousy , revenge , " tjia said .
" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .

" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .

" the characters have to continually develop in this way . " rich , poor , straight , gay take " verbotene liebe " heroine susanne brandner , for example .
after her divorce , all she wanted to do was care for her children lisa and paul .
" but then she fell in love with carla von lahnstein - her sexual orientation changed pretty fast , " tjia said . homosexuality is a big topic for the series , she said . " you have to try and incorporate real social structures and changes in the treatment , " she added . for this reason , characters in german soaps have vastly different problems on their hands than , say , characters in a latin american telenovela . " there , the conflicts mainly center around wealth - rich versus poor .
but that does n't work so well in a german series , " tjia said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrequited love is the main theme of telenovela " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- in love in berlin -rrb- but there is one common problem faced by series writers the world over : they have to produce masses of text in a very short time .
one episode per day is not unusual .
that leaves about 20 minutes for the teams to write each scene , said anja weber , director of the babelsberg school . " our financial means are also limited , " she said .
" in a hollywood production , you can write a scene where a helicopter explodes .
but in a series , that would blow the whole budget . " spinning exciting stories without the special effects is the craft of the storyliner , she said . tjia , for one , is not worried about a lack of ideas . " something new is always going on in my neighborhood , or among my friends , " she said .
" anything could be the inspiration for a story . " many of her friends , however , have asked her whether she intends to spend her entire career writing for soap operas .
after all , before completing the writing course , tjia did a degree in latin american studies .
but she defends her choice . " making up stories is a difficult task , " she said .
" it 's a lot more demanding and complex than watching the shows . " tjia 's already secured herself a contract as a junior storyliner on " verbotene liebe . "
starting in june , she 'll once again have a hand in steering the chaotic love lives of the series ' characters . bad boy appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram grandezka plays bad boy ansgar in " verbotene liebe " " i feel pretty close to these characters by now , " she said .
" just the other day i caught myself talking about tanja and nathalie - as if they were real people . " her favorite character , though , is success-hungry businessman ansgar von lahnstein , the male villain . " the evil side of his character means there 's a lot of potential , " tjia said .

" we think that after sept.11 , extraordinary renditions were not rare , but a practice that was very well known and wide-spread geographically , " said fava , an italian socialist . european parliamentarians decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations in january in parallel to a separate probe by the strasbourg-based council of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us plane in romania washington has come under intense fire in the last few months after reports about hundreds of cia flights , suspected of carrying undeclared prisoners across european airspace , since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks . because they do not have the authority to require individuals to appear before the committee , the eu lawmakers are relying on voluntary hearings and publicly available information . fava said that such voluntary hearings had confirmed that the cia was " clearly responsible for the abduction and the detention of terrorists on the member states ' territory .

" he also criticized swedish authorities for " turning egyptians mohammed al zary and ahmed agiza over to cia agents in order to repatriate them to egypt knowing very well about the risks of torture . " fava also slammed bosnian authorities for ignoring warnings of the bosnian human rights chamber in 2002 and transferring six algerian residents to the united states , which has since sent them to the controversial detention center in guantanamo , cuba . exami n i n g al-masri case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid al-masri testifying in strasbourg in march members of the parliament 's committee investigating the cia flights are to head to macedonia on thursday and friday to look into the case of khaled al-masri , a german of lebanese origin , who accuses the cia of having kidnapped him at the end of 2003 and interrogated him in afghanistan . they are also to visit the united states on a may 8-12 trip , although it is uncertain who will agree to see them there . eu foreign policy chief javier solana has agreed to meet with the lawmakers on may 2 and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has also agreed to an interview . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany accused of accepting information gained under torture a former british ambassador to uzbekistan turned up the heat on germany thursday when he told a european parliament committee that germany had received information " most certainly obtained under torture " in uzbekistan .

the term junk dna refers to those portions of the genome which appear to have no specific purpose .
but a team from ibm has identified patterns , or " motifs " , that were found both in the junk areas of the genome and those which coded for proteins .
the presence of the motifs in junk dna suggests these portions of the genome may have an important functional role .
these regions may indeed contain structure that we have n't seen before dr isidore rigoutsos , ibm the findings are reported in proceedings of the national academy of sciences journal .
but they will have to be verified by experimenters in the lab , the scientists behind the work point out .
dr andrew mccallion , who was not an author on the new paper , commented : " up until not so long ago , we were under the impression that the vast majority of information in the genome , if not all of it , was encoded in those stretches of dna that encoded proteins .
" we now understand there is much more complexity involved , " dr mccallion , from the mckusick-nathans institute of genetic medicine at the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , us , told the bbc news website .
lead author isidore rigoutsos and colleagues from ibm 's thomas j watson research center used a mathematical tool known as pattern discovery to tease out patterns in the genome .
this technique is often used to mine useful information from very large repositories of data in the worlds of business and science .
scrapheap challenge they sifted through the approximate total of six billion letters in the non-coding regions of the human genome and looked for repeating sequence fragments , or motifs .
" one of the things that arises from this paper is that junk dna may not be junk .
but this needs to be verified , " dr rigoutsos told the bbc news website .
the dna molecule the double-stranded dna molecule is held together by four chemical components called bases adenine -lrb- a -rrb- bonds with thymine -lrb- t -rrb- ; cytosine -lrb- c -rrb- bonds with guanine -lrb- g -rrb- groupings of these " letters " form the " code of life " ; there are about 2.9 billion base-pairs in the human genome wound into 24 distinct bundles , or chromosomes written in the dna are about 20-25,000 genes which human cells use as starting templates to make proteins ; these sophisticated molecules build and maintain our bodies the researchers found millions of the motifs in non-coding dna .
but roughly 128,000 of these also occurred in the coding region of the genome .
these were also over-represented in genes which are involved in specific biological processes .
these processes include the regulation of transcription - the beginning of the process that ultimately leads to the translation of the genetic code into a peptide or protein - and communication between cells .
dr rigoutsos said his team 's work suggested , " a connection between a vast area of the genome we did n't think was functional with the part of the genome we knew was functional .
" the average lab does not have the resources to prove or disprove this , so it will need a lot of effort by lots of people , " he explained .
gene silencing the paper in pnas suggests that the actual positioning of the motifs is associated with small rna molecules that are involved with a process called post-transcriptional gene silencing -lrb- ptgs -rrb- .
" a human embryo starts out as a single fertilised cell and rapidly divides into a widely complex series of cells that become a human being , " explained dr mccallion .
" every cell in that human being contains the same complement of genes and what makes each cell different is the precise way that genes are turned on and turned off . "
ptgs turns genes off after the process of transcription has taken place .
one way in which this occurs is through " rna interference " , which involves the introduction of double-stranded rna molecules .
these trigger the degradation of another type of rna molecule known as messenger rna -lrb- mrna -rrb- , " down-regulating " the gene .
during transcription , this molecule encodes and carries information from genes to sites of protein synthesis .
" these regions may indeed contain structure that we have n't seen before , " said dr rigoutsos .
" if indeed one of them corresponds to an active element that is involved in some kind of process , then the extent of cell process regulation that actually takes place is way beyond anything we have seen in the last decade . "

the term junk dna refers to those portions of the genome which appear to have no specific purpose .
but a team from ibm has identified patterns , or " motifs " , that were found both in the junk areas of the genome and those which coded for proteins .
the presence of the motifs in junk dna suggests these portions of the genome may have an important functional role .
these regions may indeed contain structure that we have n't seen before dr isidore rigoutsos , ibm the findings are reported in proceedings of the national academy of sciences journal .
but they will have to be verified by experimenters in the lab , the scientists behind the work point out .
dr andrew mccallion , who was not an author on the new paper , commented : " up until not so long ago , we were under the impression that the vast majority of information in the genome , if not all of it , was encoded in those stretches of dna that encoded proteins .
" we now understand there is much more complexity involved , " dr mccallion , from the mckusick-nathans institute of genetic medicine at the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore , us , told the bbc news website .
lead author isidore rigoutsos and colleagues from ibm 's thomas j watson research center used a mathematical tool known as pattern discovery to tease out patterns in the genome .
this technique is often used to mine useful information from very large repositories of data in the worlds of business and science .
scrapheap challenge they sifted through the approximate total of six billion letters in the non-coding regions of the human genome and looked for repeating sequence fragments , or motifs .
" one of the things that arises from this paper is that junk dna may not be junk .
but this needs to be verified , " dr rigoutsos told the bbc news website .
the dna molecule the double-stranded dna molecule is held together by four chemical components called bases adenine -lrb- a -rrb- bonds with thymine -lrb- t -rrb- ; cytosine -lrb- c -rrb- bonds with guanine -lrb- g -rrb- groupings of these " letters " form the " code of life " ; there are about 2.9 billion base-pairs in the human genome wound into 24 distinct bundles , or chromosomes written in the dna are about 20-25,000 genes which human cells use as starting templates to make proteins ; these sophisticated molecules build and maintain our bodies the researchers found millions of the motifs in non-coding dna .
but roughly 128,000 of these also occurred in the coding region of the genome .
these were also over-represented in genes which are involved in specific biological processes .
these processes include the regulation of transcription - the beginning of the process that ultimately leads to the translation of the genetic code into a peptide or protein - and communication between cells .
dr rigoutsos said his team 's work suggested , " a connection between a vast area of the genome we did n't think was functional with the part of the genome we knew was functional .
" the average lab does not have the resources to prove or disprove this , so it will need a lot of effort by lots of people , " he explained .
gene silencing the paper in pnas suggests that the actual positioning of the motifs is associated with small rna molecules that are involved with a process called post-transcriptional gene silencing -lrb- ptgs -rrb- .
" a human embryo starts out as a single fertilised cell and rapidly divides into a widely complex series of cells that become a human being , " explained dr mccallion .
" every cell in that human being contains the same complement of genes and what makes each cell different is the precise way that genes are turned on and turned off . "
ptgs turns genes off after the process of transcription has taken place .
one way in which this occurs is through " rna interference " , which involves the introduction of double-stranded rna molecules .
these trigger the degradation of another type of rna molecule known as messenger rna -lrb- mrna -rrb- , " down-regulating " the gene .

the uk government is conducting an energy review looking at how the uk can meet its future energy needs .
as well as the barrage , the assembly government submission calls for a range of solutions including clean energy and renewable technologies .
the assembly government said a barrage tapping the river severn 's tidal energy was an " exceptional opportunity " .
the 10 mile-long barrage would run from lavernock point , near cardiff , to brean down , near weston-super-mare . "
throughout its life the barrage would produce zero-carbon electricity on a totally predictable , low-cost and reliable basis " andrew davies according to the assembly government , the scheme could provide as much energy as two nuclear power stations for 150 years .
mr davies said : " the barrage would be equivalent to around two nuclear power stations operating continuously , lasting not 40 to 50 years with a problematic legacy but operating for 150 years plus .
" throughout its life the barrage would produce zero-carbon electricity on a totally predictable , low-cost and reliable basis . "
the assembly government submission added that the severn barrage should be accompanied by development of new technologies to extract energy from underground coal reserves and the use of other low-emission energy sources .
he said : " there is no doubt that clean coal and gas fired fuel power stations will play a major role in welsh electricity production for the next 20 years and more .
" wales -lrb- is -rrb- about to play an important uk gas supply role through the £ 2bn liquid natural gas developments under way at milford haven .
" also attractive are other new technologies for extracting energy from underground coal reserves , which , combined with carbon capture and storage , could create a major wales and uk low carbon energy source . "

olga norka and anghelika mashkova , from lipen in belarus , recently visited north wales as part of the programme .
among the trippers on dinas dinlle beach near caernarfon , two excited little girls throw stones into the waves .
olga and anghelika , both nine , are far from home , a landlocked village in belarus which lies hundreds of miles from the nearest sea .
belarus suffered the worst of the radioactive fall-out from chernobyl .
children like olga and anghelika are growing up with its legacy , and visits to north wales provide an escape .
parts of belarus are so contaminated today that no-one is supposed to live there .
among teenagers , rates of thyroid cancer are still abnormally high .
many suffer suppressed immune systems .
olga says she missed her parents and her cat olga and anghelika themselves are apparently healthy .
they are part of a charitable programme which brings children from belarus to wales for month-long visits , giving them healthcare and fresh air - although the emphasis is on having fun .
" i liked it very much there , " anghelika told me on her return to belarus .
" we went for walks and went riding on a horse .
we went to different parks .
we went to the sea .
we do n't have all those things here . "
both girls beamed as they recalled their time in wales .
olga says : " when we arrived we liked it very much .
we went on lots of different excursions .

a little homesickness is to be expected so far from home .
but there is a serious side to their visit here .
health care in rural belarus can be rudimentary .
in wales , they get eye and dental check-ups .
for the girls , life in belarus is far removed from that of their counterparts here .
anghelika says she liked wales " very much " by uk standards , it is a poor country with an economy struggling following the break-up of the soviet union .
around 1,000 people live in their village , lipen .
most adults work on the local collective farm .
few of the houses have running water , wells provide the main source for washing , cooking and drinking .
anghelika 's home , tin roofed and timber walled , is typical of the belarussian countryside .
inside it 's warm , if sparsely furnished .
over a meal of potato pancakes and soured cream , her step-father grigori recalled the chernobyl accident two decades ago .

anghelika 's mother irina understandably worries about her daughter 's health and she 's appreciative of the help she had in wales .
" i think she 's changed in the month she was away .
she benefited a lot from her visit .
her teeth were checked as well as her eyesight .

" not even in my wildest dreams did i imagine that i would be placed on this witness stand - from president to prisoner , " he said in court in manila .
he was arrested five years ago this wednesday , after being ousted by a popular revolt in january 2001 .
he denies corruption and amassing about $ 80m -lrb- £ 46m -rrb- while in office .
accused in court on wednesday of establishing his muslim youth foundation to launder proceeds from illegal gambling , he replied : " that 's impossible because all the foundations that i founded are legitimate foundations with a track record . "
the charity , which helped provide scholarships for muslim youths , received large donations anonymously , but mr estrada denies the gifts were bribes or that he had access to the cash .
' no rancour ' mr estrada , a former film star who had massive popular support but clashed with the political establishment , the catholic church and the army , released a statement to mark the anniversary of his detention .
" it was during these five years that i learned what true forgiveness means .
i found out that it is when you completely forgive and pray for those who have wronged you that you find spiritual fulfilment , " he said .
" there is no rancour within me . "
" i know i am innocent because i never committed those crimes that the government has charged me with , " he insisted .
if he is convicted , mr estrada , 69 , could face the death penalty , but the bbc 's sarah toms in manila says it is far more likely that he will be imprisoned or be given a pardon .

" i think we did fail , i failed and we failed generally , the home office failed , in relation to both the overall operation of the prison service and the operation of the immigration and nationality directorate . "

he has explained the situation , including his offer to resign , in the following quotes .
" thousands of people were considered for deportation and deported , but the fact is that we did n't get it fully right " .
" i think we did fail , i failed and we failed generally , the home office failed , in relation to both the overall operation of the prison service and the operation of the immigration and nationality directorate . "
" the issue is not people going free , as has been described .
they are people who have served their sentences .
the dangerous ones are under scrutiny and under supervision .
what did n't happen - and should 've happened - was they were n't considered for deportation as they should have been . "
" getting the various aspects of our operation functioning correctly is something that still remains a problem . "
" turning around these large organisations takes time , like tankers at sea . "
" i told -lsb- tony blair -rsb- i was prepared to resign , if he thought it was right .
he said he did n't think it was right . "
" i certainly feel strong regret . "
" we do not have services across the home office which we can be , and should be , completely proud of in front of the scrutiny of the people of this country .
but i do believe also we have highly committed people who are trying to get it right and steps in process to make sure we can be proud of those services . "
" what i 'm saying is the immigration and nationality service has n't kept track of the people .
that 's why they have n't known who the people were who should have been considered for deportation .
they 're going through each one of those thousand to establish exactly where they were and what the situation is . "
" i 'm not trying to suggest this is n't a very serious problem .
it is a very serious problem .
and it 's a problem as a result of the systemic failures that i 've described . "

industry newspaper variety said the show was " beyond rescue " , while the new york times ' influential ben brantley called it " a musical sleeping pill " .
the hollywood reporter , meanwhile , said it was " laughable " and " deadly dull " .
using the novels of anne rice , the musical is based on the bloodsucking character played by tom cruise in the 1994 film interview with the vampire .
co-written by sir elton 's songwriting partner bernie taupin , it opened at new york 's palace theatre on tuesday following a short run in san francisco in january . "
i 'd be an absolute liar if i said i 'm not nervous about it being a flop " sir elton john that version also received stinging reviews , although sir elton told reporters " 80 % " of the show had since been changed .
" i 'd be an absolute liar if i said i 'm not nervous about it being a flop , " he said .
" all i know is that we 've done the best we can . "
lestat 's critics have compared it to two previous vampire musicals that did not survive for long on broadway .
' flat ' show dance of the vampires lasted just a month in 2003 , while dracula the musical was staged for five months in 2004 .
" it might be time to nail the coffin lid shut on all belting bloodsuckers , " said variety 's david rooney , who called sir elton 's show " flat and underpopulated " .
mr brantley said the show - which stars hugh panaro as lestat de lioncourt , an 18th century french nobleman who becomes a vampire - was " unlikely to break the solemn curse that has plagued the genre " .
the show has received some faint praise , however , with usa today saying it " is n't nearly as bad as you may have expected " .
the financial times , meanwhile , said sir elton and mr taupin had " contributed honourably " .
speaking in 2003 , sir elton said he and his songwriting partner were " huge fans " of anne rice 's vampire books , which have sold more than 50 million copies worldwide .
lestat marks the first time sir elton - whose stage credits include billy elliot and the lion king - has written a musical with his long-time collaborator .
the show faces competition at the box office from tarzan , the phil collins musical of the 1999 disney cartoon film , which opens on 10 may .

the monopoly admitted centrica was a " potential acquisition " in an interview with bbc world news .
the possibility of a deal has raised fears over the security of gas supplies in the uk .
the admission came as a financial times report said the uk government had ruled out blocking any potential bid for centrica from the russian group .
growth plans in an interview with bbc world , the deputy chairman of the gazprom board , alexander medvedev , admitted centrica was on its list of potential takeover targets .
" centrica is considered as one of our potential acquisitions but it 's very difficult to find a company that is not on our watch list , " he said .
he added the group was planning to transform itself from a gas supplier to a " leading energy company " by taking up stakes in european power stations .
" the role of russian gas will grow , we have enough reserves to supply gas to europe , the us , china and korea . "
according to the ft , prime minister tony blair has ruled out the possibility of vetoing any bid for centrica from the russian firm as he believes the government must stick to its commitment to open up european markets .
" whatever the difficulties and challenges of globalisation , the answers will not be found in the stagnant waters of protectionism , " the paper quoted trade minister alan johnson as saying .

supply worries in february , the uk government said any gazprom bid would come under " robust scrutiny " following reports it was considering a bid for centrica .
at the time the government said that the security of uk gas supplies was " paramount " .
the russian firm is estimated to control about a third of the world 's gas reserves and supplies almost a quarter of europe 's gas .
in january it sparked a political storm when it cut supplies to ukraine in a row over prices .
the stoppage had a knock-on effect , hitting supplies to other european countries further down its pipeline .
